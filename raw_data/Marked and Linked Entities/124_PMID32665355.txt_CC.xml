RAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) plays an integral role in homologous 
recombination by activating RAD51 recombinase. Homologous recombination is 
essential for preserving genome integrity and RAD51AP1 is critical for D-loop 
formation, a key step in homologous recombination. Although RAD51AP1 is involved 
in maintaining genomic stability, recent studies have shown that RAD51AP1 
expression is significantly upregulated in human cancers. However, the 
functional role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and the underlying molecular 
mechanism(s) by which RAD51AP1 regulates tumorigenesis have not been fully 
understood. Here, we use Rad51ap1-knockout mice in genetically engineered mouse 
models of breast cancer to unravel the role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and 
metastasis. RAD51AP1 gene transcript was increased in both luminal estrogen 
receptor-positive breast cancer and basal triple-negative breast cancer, which 
is associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, knockdown of RAD51AP1 (RADP51AP1 
KD) in breast cancer cell lines reduced tumor growth. Rad51ap1-deficient mice 
were protected from oncogene-driven spontaneous mouse mammary tumor growth and 
associated lung metastasis. In vivo, limiting dilution studies provided evidence 
that Rad51ap1 plays a critical role in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) 
self-renewal. RAD51AP1 KD improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy response by 
inhibiting BCSC self-renewal and associated pluripotency. Overall, our study 
provides genetic and biochemical evidences that RAD51AP1 is critical for tumor 
growth and metastasis by increasing BCSC self-renewal and may serve as a novel 
target for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-resistant breast cancer. ]]></TEXT>

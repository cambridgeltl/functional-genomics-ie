<TEXT><![CDATA[Coupled scRNA-Seq and Intracellular Protein Activity Reveal an Immunosuppressive 
Role of TREM2 in Cancer.

Cell function and activity are regulated through integration of signaling, 
epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic pathways. Here, we introduce INs-seq, 
an integrated technology for massively parallel recording of single-cell RNA 
sequencing (scRNA-seq) and intracellular protein activity. We demonstrate the 
broad utility of INs-seq for discovering new immune subsets by profiling 
different intracellular signatures of immune signaling, transcription factor 
combinations, and metabolic activity. Comprehensive mapping of Arginase 
1-expressing cells within tumor models, a metabolic immune signature of 
suppressive activity, discovers novel Arg1+ Trem2+ regulatory myeloid (Mreg) 
cells and identifies markers, metabolic activity, and pathways associated with 
these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice inhibits accumulation of 
intra-tumoral Mreg cells, leading to a marked decrease in dysfunctional CD8+ 
TÂ cells and reduced tumor growth. This study establishes INs-seq as a broadly 
applicable technology for elucidating integrated transcriptional and 
intra-cellular maps and identifies the molecular signature of myeloid 
suppressive cells in tumors.]]></TEXT>

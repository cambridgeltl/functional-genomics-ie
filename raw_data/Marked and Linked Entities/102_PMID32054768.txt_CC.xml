and Mediates Carboplatin Resistance.

Adipocytes are critical for ovarian cancer cells to home to the omentum, but the 
metabolic changes initiated by this interaction are unknown. To this end, we 
carried out unbiased mass spectrometry-based metabolomic and proteomic profiling 
of cancer cells cocultured with primary human omental adipocytes. Cancer cells 
underwent significant proteo-metabolomic alteration(s), typified by changes in 
the lipidome with corresponding upregulation of lipid metabolism proteins. 
FABP4, a lipid chaperone protein, was identified as the critical regulator of 
lipid responses in ovarian cancer cells cocultured with adipocytes. 
Subsequently, knockdown of FABP4 resulted in increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine 
levels in the DNA, downregulation of gene signatures associated with ovarian 
cancer metastasis, and reduced clonogenic cancer cell survival. In addition, 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated 
knockout of FABP4 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells reduced metastatic 
tumor burden in mice. Consequently, a small-molecule inhibitor of FABP4 
(BMS309403) not only significantly reduced tumor burden in a syngeneic 
orthotopic mouse model but also increased the sensitivity of cancer cells toward 
carboplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results show that 
targeting FABP4 in ovarian cancer cells can inhibit their ability to adapt and 
colonize lipid-rich tumor microenvironments, providing an opportunity for 
specific metabolic targeting of ovarian cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: Ovarian 
cancer metastatic progression can be restricted by targeting a critical 
regulator of lipid responses, FABP4.]]></TEXT>

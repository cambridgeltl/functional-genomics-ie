KRAS mutant colorectal cancer.

RAS mutant (MT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is resistant to MEK1/2 
inhibition and remains a difficult-to-treat group. Therefore, there is an unmet 
need for novel treatment options for RASMT mCRC. RALA and RALB GTPases function 
downstream of RAS and have been found to be key regulators of several cell 
functions implicated in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis. However, their role as 
regulators of the apoptotic machinery remains to be elucidated. Here, we found 
that inhibition of RALB expression, but not RALA, resulted in 
Caspase-8-dependent cell death in KRASMT CRC cells, which was not further 
increased following MEK1/2 inhibition. Proteomic analysis and mechanistic 
studies revealed that RALB depletion induced a marked upregulation of the 
pro-apoptotic cell surface TRAIL Death Receptor 5 (DR5) (also known as 
TRAIL-R2), primarily through modulating DR5 protein lysosomal degradation. 
Moreover, DR5 knockdown or knockout attenuated siRALB-induced apoptosis, 
confirming the role of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway as a regulator of 
siRALB-induced cell death. Importantly, TRAIL treatment resulted in the 
association of RALB with the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and 
targeting RALB using pharmacologic inhibition or RNAi approaches triggered a 
potent increase in TRAIL-induced cell death in KRASMT CRC cells. Significantly, 
high RALB mRNA levels were found in the poor prognostic Colorectal Cancer 
Intrinsic Subtypes (CRIS)-B CRC subgroup. Collectively, this study provides to 
our knowledge the first evidence for a role for RALB in apoptotic priming and 
suggests that RALB inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve response to 
TRAIL treatment in poor prognostic RASMT CRIS-B CRC.]]></TEXT>

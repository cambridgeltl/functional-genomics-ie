occurrence.

The identification of the mechanisms predisposing to stroke may improve its 
preventive and therapeutic strategies in patients with essential hypertension. 
The role of macroautophagy/autophagy in the development of hypertension-related 
stroke needs to be clarified. We hypothesized that a defective autophagy may 
favor hypertension-related spontaneous stroke by promoting mitochondrial 
dysfunction. We studied autophagy in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive 
(SHRSP) rat, which represents a clinically relevant model of stroke associated 
with high blood pressure. We assessed autophagy, mitophagy and NAD+:NADH levels 
in brains of SHRSP and stroke-resistant SHR fed with high salt diet. Vascular 
smooth muscle cells silenced for the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufc2 gene 
(NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2) and cerebral endothelial cells 
isolated from SHRSP were also used to assess autophagy/mitophagy and 
mitochondrial function in response to high salt levels. We found a reduction of 
autophagy in brains of high salt-fed SHRSP. Autophagy impairment was associated 
with NDUFC2 downregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and NAD+ depletion. 
Restoration of NAD+ levels by nicotinamide administration reactivated autophagy 
and reduced stroke development in SHRSP. A selective reactivation of 
autophagy/mitophagy by Tat-Beclin 1 also reduced stroke occurrence, restored 
autophagy/mitophagy and improved mitochondrial function. Endothelial progenitor 
cells (EPCs) from subjects homozygous for the thymine allele variant at 
NDUFC2/rs11237379, which is associated with NDUFC2 deficiency and increased 
stroke risk, displayed an impairment of autophagy and increased senescence in 
response to high salt levels. EPC senescence was rescued by Tat-Beclin 1. 
Pharmacological activation of autophagy may represent a novel therapeutic 
strategy to reduce stroke occurrence in hypertension.]]></TEXT>

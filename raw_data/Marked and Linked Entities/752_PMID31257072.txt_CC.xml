<TEXT><![CDATA[Anti-tumor Activity of the Type I PRMT Inhibitor, GSK3368715, Synergizes with 
PRMT5 Inhibition through MTAP Loss.

Type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) catalyze asymmetric 
dimethylation of arginines on proteins. Type I PRMTs and their substrates have 
been implicated in human cancers, suggesting inhibition of type I PRMTs may 
offer a therapeutic approach for oncology. The current report describes 
GSK3368715 (EPZ019997), a potent, reversible type I PRMT inhibitor with 
anti-tumor effects in human cancer models. Inhibition of PRMT5, the predominant 
type II PRMT, produces synergistic cancer cell growth inhibition when combined 
with GSK3368715. Interestingly, deletion of the methylthioadenosine 
phosphorylase gene (MTAP) results in accumulation of the metabolite 
2-methylthioadenosine, an endogenous inhibitor of PRMT5, and correlates with 
sensitivity to GSK3368715 in cell lines. These data provide rationale to explore 
MTAP status as a biomarker strategy for patient selection.]]></TEXT>

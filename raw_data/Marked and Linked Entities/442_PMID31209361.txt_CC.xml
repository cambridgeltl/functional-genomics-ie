doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via activating AKT.

Oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis play critical roles in doxorubicin 
(DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. Previous studies indicated that fibronectin type 
III domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) and its cleaved form, irisin, could preserve 
mitochondrial function and attenuate oxidative damage as well as cell apoptosis, 
however, its role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains unknown. Our present 
study aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of FNDC5 on 
oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. 
Cardiomyocyte-specific FNDC5 overexpression was achieved using an 
adeno-associated virus system, and then the mice were exposed to a single 
intraperitoneal injection of DOX (15 mg/kg) to generate DOX-induced 
cardiotoxicity. Herein, we found that FNDC5 expression was downregulated in 
DOX-treated murine hearts and cardiomyocytes. Fndc5 deficiency resulted in 
increased oxidative damage and apoptosis in H9C2 cells under basal conditions, 
imitating the phenotype of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in vitro, conversely, 
FNDC5 overexpression or irisin treatment alleviated DOX-induced oxidative stress 
and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified 
that FNDC5/Irisin activated AKT/mTOR signaling and decreased DOX-induced 
cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and moreover, we provided direct evidence that the 
anti-oxidant effect of FNDC5/Irisin was mediated by the AKT/GSK3β/FYN/Nrf2 axis 
in an mTOR-independent manner. And we also demonstrated that heat shock protein 
20 was responsible for the activation of AKT caused by FNDC5/Irisin. In line 
with the data in acute model, we also found that FNDC5/Irisin exerted beneficial 
effects in chronic model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (5 mg/kg, i.p., once a 
week for three times, the total cumulative dose is 15 mg/kg) in mice. Based on 
these findings, we supposed that FNDC5/Irisin was a potential therapeutic agent 
against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

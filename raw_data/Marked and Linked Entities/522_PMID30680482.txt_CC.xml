apoptosis.

Smac mimetics that deplete cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins have 
been shown to activate Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Here, we report that Smac 
mimetic-mediated activation of NF-κB contributes to the rescue of cancer cells 
from tunicamycin (TM)-triggered apoptosis. The prototypic Smac mimetic BV6 
activates non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways, while TM has little effect 
on NF-κB signaling. Importantly, ectopic expression of dominant-negative IκBα 
superrepressor (IκBα-SR), which inhibits canonical and non-canonical NF-κB 
activation, significantly reversed this BV6-imposed protection against TM. 
Similarly, transient or stable knockdown of NF-κB-inducing kinase, which 
accumulated upon exposure to BV6 alone and in combination with TM, significantly 
counteracted BV6-mediated inhibition of TM-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, 
while cIAP2 was initially degraded upon BV6 treatment, it was subsequently 
upregulated in an NF-κB-dependent manner, as this restoration of cIAP2 
expression was abolished in IκBα-SR-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, upon 
exposure to TM/BV6 apoptosis was significantly increased in cIAP2 knockdown 
cells. Furthermore, NF-κB inhibition partially prevented BV6-stimulated 
expression of Mcl-1 upon TM treatment. Consistently, Mcl-1 silencing 
significantly inhibited BV6-mediated protection from TM-induced apoptosis. Thus, 
NF-κB activation by Smac mimetic contributes to Smac mimetic-mediated protection 
against TM-induced apoptosis.]]></TEXT>

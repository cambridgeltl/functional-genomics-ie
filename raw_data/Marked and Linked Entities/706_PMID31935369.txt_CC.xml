<TEXT><![CDATA[Treatment-Induced Tumor Dormancy through YAP-Mediated Transcriptional 
Reprogramming of the Apoptotic Pathway.

Eradicating tumor dormancy that develops following epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment of EGFR-mutant 
non-small cell lung cancer, is an attractive therapeutic strategy but the 
mechanisms governing this process are poorly understood. Blockade of ERK1/2 
reactivation following EGFR TKI treatment by combined EGFR/MEK inhibition 
uncovers cells that survive by entering a senescence-like dormant state 
characterized by high YAP/TEAD activity. YAP/TEAD engage the 
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factor SLUG to directly 
repress pro-apoptotic BMF, limiting drug-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological 
co-inhibition of YAP and TEAD, or genetic deletion of YAP1, all deplete dormant 
cells by enhancing EGFR/MEK inhibition-induced apoptosis. Enhancing the initial 
efficacy of targeted therapies could ultimately lead to prolonged treatment 
responses in cancer patients.

attenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease 
characterized by chronic non-specific inflammation of the interstitial lung and 
extensive deposition of collagen fibers leading to destruction of lung function. 
Studies have demonstrated that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) 
increases the risk of IPF. In order to recover from PM2.5-induced lung injury, 
alveolar epithelial cells need to be repaired and regenerated to maintain lung 
function. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) are stem cells in the adult 
lung that contribute to the lung repair process through complex signaling. Our 
previous studies demonstrated that RAB6, a RAS family member lowly expressed in 
lung cancer, inhibited lung cancer stem cell self-renewal, but it is unclear 
whether or not and how RAB6 may regulate AEC2 cell proliferation and 
self-renewal in PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that 
knockout of RAB6 inhibited pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and AEC2 cell 
death in PM2.5-injured mice. In addition, knockout of RAB6 decreased Dickkopf 
1(DKK1) autocrine and activated proliferation, self-renewal, and wnt/β-catenin 
signaling of PM2.5-injured AEC2 cells. RAB6 overexpression increased DKK1 
autocrine and inhibited proliferation, self-renewal and wnt/β-catenin signaling 
in AEC2 cells in vitro. Furthermore, DKK1 inhibitors promoted proliferation, 
self-renewal and wnt/β-catenin signaling of RAB6 overexpressing AEC2 cells, and 
attenuated PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These data establish RAB6 
as a regulator of DKK1 autocrine and wnt/β-catenin signal that serves to 
regulate AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal, and suggest a mechanism that 
RAB6 disruption may promote AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal to enhance 
lung repair following PM2.5 injury.]]></TEXT>

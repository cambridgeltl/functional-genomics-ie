<TEXT><![CDATA[SIRT6 knockout cells resist apoptosis initiation but not progression: a 
computational method to evaluate the progression of apoptosis.

Apoptosis is essential for numerous processes, such as development, resistance 
to infections, and suppression of tumorigenesis. Here, we investigate the 
influence of the nutrient sensing and longevity-assuring enzyme SIRT6 on the 
dynamics of apoptosis triggered by serum starvation. Specifically, we 
characterize the progression of apoptosis in wild type and SIRT6 deficient mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts using time-lapse flow cytometry and computational 
modelling based on rate-equations and cell distribution analysis. We find that 
SIRT6 deficient cells resist apoptosis by delaying its initiation. 
Interestingly, once apoptosis is initiated, the rate of its progression is 
higher in SIRT6 null cells compared to identically cultured wild type cells. 
However, SIRT6 null cells succumb to apoptosis more slowly, not only in response 
to nutrient deprivation but also in response to other stresses. Our data suggest 
that SIRT6 plays a role in several distinct steps of apoptosis. Overall, we 
demonstrate the utility of our computational model to describe stages of 
apoptosis progression and the integrity of the cellular membrane. Such 
measurements will be useful in a broad range of biological applications.]]></TEXT>

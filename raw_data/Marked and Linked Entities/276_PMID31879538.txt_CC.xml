<TEXT><![CDATA[TRPS1 acts as a context-dependent regulator of mammary epithelial cell 
growth/differentiation and breast cancer development.

The GATA-type zinc finger transcription factor TRPS1 has been implicated in 
breast cancer. However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications 
and inactivating mutations in TRPS1 have been reported. Here, we used in vitro 
and in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary 
gland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by 
functional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary 
epithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling 
promotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 
expression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo 
survival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, 
the consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined 
inactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary 
organoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results 
demonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in 
breast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal 
mammary epithelial cells.

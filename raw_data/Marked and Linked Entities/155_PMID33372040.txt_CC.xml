DNA Replication and Repair Pathways.

Although the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 play fundamental roles in 
cancer, the specific pathways and downstream targets by which they exert their 
tumorigenic effects remain elusive. In this study, we uncover distinct and novel 
functions for these kinases in regulating tumor formation and metastatic 
colonization in various solid tumors, including those of the breast, prostate, 
and pancreas. Combining in vivo CRISPR-based CDK4 and CDK6 gene editing with 
pharmacologic inhibition approaches in orthotopic transplantation and 
patient-derived xenograft preclinical models, we defined clear functions for 
CDK4 and CDK6 in facilitating tumor growth and progression in metastatic 
cancers. Transcriptomic profiling of CDK4/6 CRISPR knockouts in breast cancer 
revealed these two kinases to regulate cancer progression through distinct 
mechanisms. CDK4 regulated prometastatic inflammatory cytokine signaling, 
whereas CDK6 mainly controlled DNA replication and repair processes. Inhibition 
of CDK6 but not CDK4 resulted in defective DNA repair and increased DNA damage. 
Multiple CDK6 DNA replication/repair genes were not only associated with cancer 
subtype, grades, and poor clinical outcomes, but also facilitated primary tumor 
growth and metastasis in vivo. CRISPR-based genomic deletion of CDK6 efficiently 
blocked tumor formation and progression in preestablished cell- and 
patient-derived xenograft preclinical models of breast cancer, providing a 
potential novel targeted therapy for these deadly tumors.]]></TEXT>

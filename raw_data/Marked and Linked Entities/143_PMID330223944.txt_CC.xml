Immune Microenvironment and Driving Type 2 Immunity.

Lungs are one of the main sites of breast cancer metastasis. The metastatic 
microenvironment is essential to facilitate growth of disseminated tumor cells. 
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are prominent players in the 
microenvironment of breast cancer. However, their role in the formation of a 
permissive metastatic niche is unresolved. Here we show that IL33 is upregulated 
in metastases-associated fibroblasts in mouse models of spontaneous breast 
cancer metastasis and in patients with breast cancer with lung metastasis. 
Upregulation of IL33 instigated type 2 inflammation in the metastatic 
microenvironment and mediated recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and 
inflammatory monocytes to lung metastases. Importantly, targeting of IL33 in 
vivo resulted in inhibition of lung metastasis and significant attenuation of 
immune cell recruitment and type 2 immunity. These findings demonstrate a key 
function of IL33 in facilitating lung metastatic relapse by modulating the 
immune microenvironment. Our study shows a novel interaction axis between CAF 
and immune cells and reveals the central role of CAF in establishing a 
hospitable inflammatory niche in lung metastasis. ]]></TEXT>

murine macrophages.

ATP acts as a canonical activator to induce NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, 
pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation in macrophages, leading to 
caspase-1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. It remains unclear whether 
ATP can induce pyroptosis in macrophages when the NLRP3 pathway is blocked by 
pathogenic infection. In this study, we used cellular models to mimic such 
blockade of NLRP3 activation: bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated 
with NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950 and RAW264.7 cells deficient in ASC 
(apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment 
domain) expression. The results showed that ATP treatment induced lytic cell 
death morphologically resembling canonical pyroptosis in both MCC950-treated 
BMDMs and RAW264.7 cells, but did not cause the activation of caspase-1 (by 
detecting caspase-1p10 and mature interleukin-1Î²) and cleavage of GSDMD. 
Instead, both apoptotic initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 
and -7) caspases were evidently activated and gasdermin E (GSDME) was cleaved to 
generate its N-terminal fragment (GSDME-NT) which executes pyroptosis. The 
GSDME-NT production and lytic cell death induced by ATP were diminished by 
caspase-3 inhibitor. In BMDMs without MCC950 treatment, ATP induced the 
formation of ASC specks which were co-localized with caspase-8; with MCC950 
treatment, however, ATP did not induced the formation of ASC specks. In RAW264.7 
cells, knockdown of GSDME by small interfering RNA attenuated ATP-induced lytic 
cell death and HMGB1 release into culture supernatants. Collectively, our 
results indicate that ATP induces pyroptosis in macrophages through the 
caspase-3/GSDME axis when the canonical NLRP3 pathway is blocked, suggestive of 
an alternative mechanism for combating against pathogen evasion.]]></TEXT>

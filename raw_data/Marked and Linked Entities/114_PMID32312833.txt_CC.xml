Growth and Metastasis in Breast Cancer.

Aberrant activation of histone methyltransferase EZH2 and ribosome synthesis 
strongly associate with cancer development and progression. We previously found 
that EZH2 regulates RNA polymerase III-transcribed 5S ribosomal RNA gene 
transcription. However, whether EZH2 regulates ribosome synthesis is still 
unknown. Here, we report that EZH2 promotes ribosome synthesis by targeting and 
silencing a long noncoding RNA PHACTR2-AS1. PHACTR2-AS1 directly bound ribosome 
DNA genes and recruited histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, which in turn 
triggered H3K9 methylation of these genes. Depletion of PHACTR2-AS1 resulted in 
hyperactivation of ribosome synthesis and instability of ribosomal DNA, which 
promoted cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Administration of 
PHACTR2-AS1-30nt-RNA, which binds to SUV39H1, effectively inhibited breast 
cancer growth and lung metastasis in mice. PHACTR2-AS1 was downregulated in 
breast cancer patients, where lower PHACTR2-AS1 expression promoted breast 
cancer development and correlated with poor patient outcome. Taken together, we 
demonstrate that PHACTR2-AS1 maintains a H3K9 methylation-marked silent state of 
ribosomal DNA genes, comprising a regulatory axis that controls breast cancer 
growth and metastasis. ]]></TEXT>

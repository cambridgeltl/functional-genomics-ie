Fibroblast-Mediated CD8 T-cell Exclusion from Tumors.

Determining mechanisms of resistance to αPD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint 
immunotherapy is key to developing new treatment strategies. Cancer-associated 
fibroblasts (CAF) have many tumor-promoting functions and promote immune evasion 
through multiple mechanisms, but as yet, no CAF-specific inhibitors are 
clinically available. Here we generated CAF-rich murine tumor models (TC1, MC38, 
and 4T1) to investigate how CAFs influence the immune microenvironment and 
affect response to different immunotherapy modalities [anticancer vaccination, 
TC1 (HPV E7 DNA vaccine), αPD-1, and MC38] and found that CAFs broadly 
suppressed response by specifically excluding CD8+ T cells from tumors (not CD4+ 
T cells or macrophages); CD8+ T-cell exclusion was similarly present in CAF-rich 
human tumors. RNA sequencing of CD8+ T cells from CAF-rich murine tumors and 
immunochemistry analysis of human tumors identified significant upregulation of 
CTLA-4 in the absence of other exhaustion markers; inhibiting CTLA-4 with a 
nondepleting antibody overcame the CD8+ T-cell exclusion effect without 
affecting Tregs. We then examined the potential for CAF targeting, focusing on 
the ROS-producing enzyme NOX4, which is upregulated by CAF in many human 
cancers, and compared this with TGFβ1 inhibition, a key regulator of the CAF 
phenotype. siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition [GKT137831 (Setanaxib)] 
of NOX4 "normalized" CAF to a quiescent phenotype and promoted intratumoral CD8+ 
T-cell infiltration, overcoming the exclusion effect; TGFβ1 inhibition could 
prevent, but not reverse, CAF differentiation. Finally, NOX4 inhibition restored 
immunotherapy response in CAF-rich tumors. These findings demonstrate that 
CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance can be effectively overcome through NOX4 
inhibition and could improve outcome in a broad range of cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: 
NOX4 is critical for maintaining the immune-suppressive CAF phenotype in tumors. 
Pharmacologic inhibition of NOX4 potentiates immunotherapy by overcoming 
CAF-mediated CD8+ T-cell exclusion.]]></TEXT>

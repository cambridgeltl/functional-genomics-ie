for other processes in wing development.

Previous studies in several model organisms have revealed that members of the 
Forkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family have multiple functions. Drosophila 
Jumeau (Jumu), a member of this family, participates in cardiogenesis, 
hematopoiesis and immune system homeostasis. Here, we show that loss of jumu 
function positively regulates or triggers apoptosis via a JNK-dependent pathway 
in wing development. jumu mutants showed reduced wing size and increased 
apoptosis. Moreover, we observed a loss of the anterior cross vein (ACV) 
phenotype that was similar to that observed in wings in which JNK signaling has 
been ectopically activated. The JNK signaling markers puckered (puc) and p-JNK 
were also significantly increased in the wing discs of jumu mutants. In 
addition, apoptosis induced by the loss of jumu was rescued by knocking down 
JNK, indicating a role for JNK in reducing jumu-induced apoptosis. Jumu could 
also control wing margin development via the positive regulation of cut 
expression, and the observed wing margin defect did not result from a loss of 
jumu-induced apoptosis. Further, jumu deficiency in the pupal wing could induce 
multiple wing hairs via a Rho1-mediated planar cell polarity pathway, but 
abnormal Rho1 expression was not why jumu loss induced apoptosis via a 
JNK-dependent pathway in wing discs.]]></TEXT>

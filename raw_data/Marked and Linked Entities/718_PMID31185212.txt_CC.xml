Engraftment and Immune Attack in Solid Tumors.

We investigated the role of chemokines in regulating T cell accumulation in 
solid tumors. CCL5 and CXCL9 overexpression was associated with CD8+ T cell 
infiltration in solid tumors. T cell infiltration required tumor cell-derived 
CCL5 and was amplified by IFN-γ-inducible, myeloid cell-secreted CXCL9. CCL5 and 
CXCL9 coexpression revealed immunoreactive tumors with prolonged survival and 
response to checkpoint blockade. Loss of CCL5 expression in human tumors was 
associated with epigenetic silencing through DNA methylation. Reduction of CCL5 
expression caused tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) desertification, whereas 
forced CCL5 expression prevented Cxcl9 expression and TILs loss, and attenuated 
tumor growth in mice through IFN-γ. The cooperation between tumor-derived CCL5 
and IFN-γ-inducible CXCR3 ligands secreted by myeloid cells is key for 
orchestrating T cell infiltration in immunoreactive and immunoresponsive tumors.]]></TEXT>

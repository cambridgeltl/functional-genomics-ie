Lung Cancer.

Epigenetic modifiers frequently harbor loss-of-function mutations in lung 
cancer, but their tumor-suppressive roles are poorly characterized. Histone 
methyltransferase KMT2D (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also called MLL4) is among the 
most highly inactivated epigenetic modifiers in lung cancer. Here, we show that 
lung-specific loss of Kmt2d promotes lung tumorigenesis in mice and upregulates 
pro-tumorigenic programs, including glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of 
glycolysis preferentially impedes tumorigenicity of human lung cancer cells 
bearing KMT2D-inactivating mutations. Mechanistically, Kmt2d loss widely impairs 
epigenomic signals for super-enhancers/enhancers, including the super-enhancer 
for the circadian rhythm repressor Per2. Loss of Kmt2d decreases expression of 
PER2, which regulates multiple glycolytic genes. These findings indicate that 
KMT2D is a lung tumor suppressor and that KMT2D deficiency confers a therapeutic 
vulnerability to glycolytic inhibitors.]]></TEXT>

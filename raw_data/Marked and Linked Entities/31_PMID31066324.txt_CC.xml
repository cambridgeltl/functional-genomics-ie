effect of ischemic preconditioning in kidneys.

Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) affords tissue protection in organs including 
kidneys; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we demonstrate 
an important role of macroautophagy/autophagy (especially mitophagy) in the 
protective effect of IPC in kidneys. IPC induced autophagy in renal tubular 
cells in mice and suppressed subsequent renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). 
The protective effect of IPC was abolished by pharmacological inhibitors of 
autophagy and by the ablation of Atg7 from kidney proximal tubules. Pretreatment 
with BECN1/Beclin1 peptide induced autophagy and protected against IRI. These 
results suggest the dependence of IPC protection on renal autophagy. During IPC, 
the mitophagy regulator PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) was activated. 
Both IPC and BECN1 peptide enhanced mitolysosome formation during renal IRI in 
mitophagy reporter mice, suggesting that IPC may protect kidneys by activating 
mitophagy. We further established an in vitro model of IPC by inducing 'chemical 
ischemia' in kidney proximal tubular cells with carbonyl cyanide 
3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Brief treatment with CCCP protected against 
subsequent injury in these cells and the protective effect was abrogated by 
autophagy inhibition. In vitro IPC increased mitophagosome formation, enhanced 
the delivery of mitophagosomes to lysosomes, and promoted the clearance of 
damaged mitochondria during subsequent CCCP treatment. IPC also suppressed 
mitochondrial depolarization, improved ATP production, and inhibited the 
generation of reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Pink1 suppressed mitophagy 
and reduced the cytoprotective effect of IPC. Together, these results suggest 
that autophagy, especially mitophagy, plays an important role in the protective 
effect of IPC.]]></TEXT>

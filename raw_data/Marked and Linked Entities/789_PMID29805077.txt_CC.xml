<TEXT><![CDATA[Cancer Cells Co-opt the Neuronal Redox-Sensing Channel TRPA1 to Promote 
Oxidative-Stress Tolerance.

Cancer cell survival is dependent on oxidative-stress defenses against reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate during tumorigenesis. Here, we show a 
non-canonical oxidative-stress defense mechanism through TRPA1, a neuronal 
redox-sensing Ca2+-influx channel. In TRPA1-enriched breast and lung cancer 
spheroids, TRPA1 is critical for survival of inner cells that exhibit ROS 
accumulation. Moreover, TRPA1 promotes resistance to ROS-producing 
chemotherapies, and TRPA1 inhibition suppresses xenograft tumor growth and 
enhances chemosensitivity. TRPA1 does not affect redox status but upregulates 
Ca2+-dependent anti-apoptotic pathways. NRF2, an oxidant-defense transcription 
factor, directly controls TRPA1 expression, thus providing an orthogonal 
mechanism for protection against oxidative stress together with canonical 
ROS-neutralizing mechanisms. These findings reveal an oxidative-stress defense 
program involving TRPA1 that could be exploited for targeted cancer therapies.]]></TEXT>

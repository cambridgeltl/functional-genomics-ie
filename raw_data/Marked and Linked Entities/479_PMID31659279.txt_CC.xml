retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis.

Among caspase family members, Caspase-8 is unique, with associated critical 
activities to induce and suppress death receptor-mediated apoptosis and 
necroptosis, respectively. Caspase-8 inhibits necroptosis by suppressing the 
function of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1 or RIP1) and RIPK3 to 
activate mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Disruption of Caspase-8 
expression causes embryonic lethality in mice, which is rescued by depletion of 
either Ripk3 or Mlkl, indicating that the embryonic lethality is caused by 
activation of necroptosis. Here, we show that knockdown of Caspase-8 expression 
in embryoid bodies derived from ES cells markedly enhances retinoic acid 
(RA)-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis, both of which are dependent 
on Ripk1 and Ripk3; however, the enhancement of RA-induced cell differentiation 
is independent of Mlkl and necrosome formation. RA treatment obviously enhanced 
the expression of RA-specific target genes having the retinoic acid response 
element (RARE) in their promoter regions to induce cell differentiation, and 
induced marked expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL to stimulate necroptosis. 
Caspase-8 knockdown induced RIPK1 and RIPK3 to translocate into the nucleus and 
to form a complex with RA receptor (RAR), and RAR interacting with RIPK1 and 
RIPK3 showed much stronger binding activity to RARE than RAR without RIPK1 or 
RIPK3. In Caspase-8-deficient as well as Caspase-8- and Mlkl-deficient mouse 
embryos, the expression of RA-specific target genes was obviously enhanced. 
Thus, Caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3 regulate RA-induced cell differentiation and 
necroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.]]></TEXT>

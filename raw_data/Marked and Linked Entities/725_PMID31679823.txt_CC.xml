Small molecules that directly target MYC and are also well tolerated in vivo 
will provide invaluable chemical probes and potential anti-cancer therapeutic 
agents. We developed a series of small-molecule MYC inhibitors that engage MYC 
inside cells, disrupt MYC/MAX dimers, and impair MYC-driven gene expression. The 
compounds enhance MYC phosphorylation on threonine-58, consequently increasing 
proteasome-mediated MYC degradation. The initial lead, MYC inhibitor 361 
(MYCi361), suppressed in vivo tumor growth in mice, increased tumor immune cell 
infiltration, upregulated PD-L1 on tumors, and sensitized tumors to anti-PD1 
immunotherapy. However, 361 demonstrated a narrow therapeutic index. An improved 
analog, MYCi975 showed better tolerability. These findings suggest the potential 
of small-molecule MYC inhibitors as chemical probes and possible anti-cancer 
therapeutic agents.]]></TEXT>

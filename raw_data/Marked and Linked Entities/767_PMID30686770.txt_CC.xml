<TEXT><![CDATA[Targeting the Vulnerability of Glutathione Metabolism in ARID1A-Deficient 
Cancers.

ARID1A encodes an SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling factor and is frequently mutated 
in various cancers. This study demonstrates that ARID1A-deficient cancer cells 
are specifically vulnerable to inhibition of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) 
and the glutamate-cysteine ligase synthetase catalytic subunit (GCLC), a 
rate-limiting enzyme for GSH synthesis. Inhibition of GCLC markedly decreased 
GSH in ARID1A-deficient cancer cells, leading to apoptotic cell death triggered 
by excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species. The vulnerability of 
ARID1A-deficient cancer cells results from low basal levels of GSH due to 
impaired expression of SLC7A11. The SLC7A11-encoded cystine transporter supplies 
cells with cysteine, a key source of GSH, and its expression is enhanced by 
ARID1A-mediated chromatin remodeling. Thus, ARID1A-deficient cancers are 
susceptible to synthetic lethal targeting of GCLC.]]></TEXT>

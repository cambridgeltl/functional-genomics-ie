<TEXT><![CDATA[PPPDE1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma development by negatively regulate p53 
and apoptosis.

We have previously identified that PPPDE1 is a deubiquitinase (DUB) belonging to 
a cysteine isopeptidase family. Here we sought to explore the biological 
significance of PPPDE1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its underlying molecular 
mechanism. In the present study, we found that amplification and overexpression 
of PPPDE1 were associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
We also demonstrated that knocking down of PPPDE1 could significantly block the 
clonal growth and tumorigenicity of human HCC cells, which revealed a critical 
role for PPPDE1 in HCC development. Furthermore, we proved that PPPDE1 is a key 
modulator of p53 protein level and its down stream apoptosis pathway. Taken 
together, these results suggested that PPPDE1 is a putative HCC driver gene and 
extensive studies should be conducted in the future to investigate the role of 
PPPDE1 in HCC and other tumors.]]></TEXT>

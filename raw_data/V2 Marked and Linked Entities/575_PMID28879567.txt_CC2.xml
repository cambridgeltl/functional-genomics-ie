We previously reported that microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) 
contributed to adriamycin (Adr)-induced podocyte apoptosis. However, the 
molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we studied the role of mPGES-1/PGE2 
cascade in activating Stat3 signaling and the contribution of Stat3 in PGE2- and 
Adr-induced podocyte apoptosis. In murine podocytes, PGE2 dose- and 
time-dependently increased the phosphorylation of Stat3 in line with the 
enhanced cell apoptosis and reduced podocyte protein podocin. In agreement with 
the increased Stat3 phosphorylation, Stat3-derived cytokines including IL-6, 
IL-17, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 were significantly upregulated following PGE2 
treatment. By application of a specific Stat3 inhibitor S3I-201, PGE2-induced 
podocyte apoptosis was largely abolished in parallel with a blockade of podocin 
reduction. Next, we observed that Adr treatment also enhanced p-Stat3 and 
activated mPGES-1/PGE2 cascade. Blockade of Stat3 by S3I-201 significantly 
ameliorated Adr-induced cell apoptosis and podocin reduction. More 
interestingly, silencing mPGES-1 in podocytes by mPGES-1 siRNA blocked 
Adr-induced increments of Stat-3 phosphorylation, PGE2 production, and 
Stat3-derived inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, this study suggested that 
mPGES-1-derived PGE2 could activate Stat3 signaling to promote podocyte 
apoptosis. Targeting mPGES-1/PGE2/Stat3 signaling might be a potential strategy 
for the treatment of podocytopathy.]]></TEXT>

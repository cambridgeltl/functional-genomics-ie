<TEXT><![CDATA[RIP1 Kinase Drives Macrophage-Mediated Adaptive Immune Tolerance in Pancreatic 
Cancer.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by immune tolerance and 
immunotherapeutic resistance. We discovered upregulation of receptor-interacting 
serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIP1) in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
in PDA. To study its role in oncogenic progression, we developed a selective 
small-molecule RIP1 inhibitor with high in vivo exposure. Targeting RIP1 
reprogrammed TAMs toward an MHCIIhiTNFα+IFNγ+ immunogenic phenotype in a 
STAT1-dependent manner. RIP1 inhibition in TAMs resulted in cytotoxic T cell 
activation and T helper cell differentiation toward a mixed Th1/Th17 phenotype, 
leading to tumor immunity in mice and in organotypic models of human PDA. 
Targeting RIP1 synergized with PD1-and inducible co-stimulator-based 
immunotherapies. Tumor-promoting effects of RIP1 were independent of its 
co-association with RIP3. Collectively, our work describes RIP1 as a checkpoint 
kinase governing tumor immunity.

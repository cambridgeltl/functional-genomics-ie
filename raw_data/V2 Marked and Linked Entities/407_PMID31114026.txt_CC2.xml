homeostasis.

The antimalarial drug artemisinin and its derivatives have been explored as 
potential anticancer agents, but their underlying mechanisms are controversial. 
In this study, we found that artemisinin compounds can sensitize cancer cells to 
ferroptosis, a new form of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid 
peroxidation. Mechanistically, dihydroartemisinin (DAT) can induce lysosomal 
degradation of ferritin in an autophagy-independent manner, increasing the 
cellular free iron level and causing cells to become more sensitive to 
ferroptosis. Further, by associating with cellular free iron and thus 
stimulating the binding of iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) with mRNA molecules 
containing iron-responsive element (IRE) sequences, DAT impinges on 
IRP/IRE-controlled iron homeostasis to further increase cellular free iron. 
Importantly, in both in vitro and a mouse xenograft model in which ferroptosis 
was triggered in cancer cells by the inducible knockout of GPX4, we found that 
DAT can augment GPX4 inhibition-induced ferroptosis in a cohort of cancer cells 
that are otherwise highly resistant to ferroptosis. Collectively, artemisinin 
compounds can sensitize cells to ferroptosis by regulating cellular iron 
homeostasis. Our findings can be exploited clinically to enhance the effect of 
future ferroptosis-inducing cancer therapies.]]></TEXT>

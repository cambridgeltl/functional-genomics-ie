<TEXT><![CDATA[RIP1 inhibition blocks inflammatory diseases but not tumor growth or metastases.

The kinase RIP1 acts in multiple signaling pathways to regulate inflammatory 
responses and it can trigger both apoptosis and necroptosis. Its kinase activity 
has been implicated in a range of inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and oncogenic 
diseases. Here, we explore the effect of inhibiting RIP1 genetically, using 
knock-in mice that express catalytically inactive RIP1 D138N, or 
pharmacologically, using the murine-potent inhibitor GNE684. Inhibition of RIP1 
reduced collagen antibody-induced arthritis, and prevented skin inflammation 
caused by mutation of Sharpin, or colitis caused by deletion of Nemo from 
intestinal epithelial cells. Conversely, inhibition of RIP1 had no effect on 
tumor growth or survival in pancreatic tumor models driven by mutant Kras, nor 
did it reduce lung metastases in a B16 melanoma model. Collectively, our data 
emphasize a role for the kinase activity of RIP1 in certain inflammatory disease 
models, but question its relevance to tumor progression and metastases.]]></TEXT>

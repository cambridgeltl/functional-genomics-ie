Stabilizing YAP/TAZ.

Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with 
PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), play pivotal roles in promoting the progression of 
hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism underpinning 
aberrant activation of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In 
this study, we globally profiled the contribution of deubiquitinating enzymes 
(DUB) to both transcriptional activity and protein abundance of YAP/TAZ in 
hepatocellular carcinoma models and identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 
(USP10) as a potent YAP/TAZ-activating DUB. Mechanistically, USP10 directly 
interacted with and stabilized YAP/TAZ by reverting their proteolytic 
ubiquitination. Depletion of USP10 enhanced polyubiquitination of YAP/TAZ, 
promoted their proteasomal degradation, and ultimately arrested the 
proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Expression 
levels of USP10 positively correlated with the abundance of YAP/TAZ in 
hepatocellular carcinoma patient samples as well as in N-nitrosodiethylamine 
(DEN)-induced liver cancer mice models. Collectively, this study establishes the 
causal link between USP10 and hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma 
cells and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the 
treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma harboring a high level of 
YAP/TAZ. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify USP10 as a DUB of YAP/TAZ and its 
role in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, which may serve as a potential 
therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.

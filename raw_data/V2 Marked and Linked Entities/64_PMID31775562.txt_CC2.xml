<TEXT><![CDATA[Hypoxia-induced autophagy drives colorectal cancer initiation and progression by 
activating the PRKC/PKC-EZR (ezrin) pathway.

In solid tumors, cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are 
often found in hypoxic niches. Nevertheless, the influence of hypoxia on TICs is 
poorly understood. Using previously established, TIC-enrichedpatient-derived 
colorectal cancer (CRC) cultures, we show that hypoxia increases the 
self-renewal capacity of TICs while inducing proliferation arrest in their more 
differentiated counterpart cultures. Gene expression data revealed 
macroautophagy/autophagy as one of the major pathways induced by hypoxia in 
TICs. Interestingly, hypoxia-induced autophagy was found to induce 
phosphorylation of EZR (ezrin) at Thr567 residue, which could be reversed by 
knocking down ATG5, BNIP3, BNIP3L, or BECN1. Furthermore, we identified 
PRKCA/PKCÎ± as a potential kinase involved in hypoxia-induced autophagy-mediated 
TIC self-renewal. Genetic targeting of autophagy or pharmacological inhibition 
of PRKC/PKC and EZR resulted in decreased tumor-initiating potential of TICs. In 
addition, we observed significantly reduced in vivo tumor initiation and growth 
after a stable knockdown of ATG5. Analysis of human CRC samples showed that 
p-EZR is often present in TICs located in the hypoxic and autophagic regions of 
the tumor. Altogether, our results establish the hypoxia-autophagy-PKC-EZR 
signaling axis as a novel regulatory mechanism of TIC self-renewal and CRC 
progression. Autophagy inhibition might thus represent a promising therapeutic 
strategy for cancer patients.]]></TEXT>

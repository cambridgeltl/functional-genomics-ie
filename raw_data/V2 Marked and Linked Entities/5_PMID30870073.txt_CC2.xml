dictates the fate of hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cardiomyocytes.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modifications play critical roles in various 
biological processes. However, no study addresses the role of m6A in 
macroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that m6A modifications are increased in 
H/R-treated cardiomyocytes and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-treated mice heart. We 
found that METTL3 (methyltransferase like 3) is the primary factor involved in 
aberrant m6A modification. Silencing METTL3 enhances autophagic flux and 
inhibits apoptosis in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression of 
METTL3 or inhibition of the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 has an opposite effect, 
suggesting that METTL3 is a negative regulator of autophagy. Mechanistically, 
METTL3 methylates TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy 
genes, at two m6A residues in the 3'-UTR, which promotes the association of the 
RNA-binding protein HNRNPD with TFEB pre-mRNA and subsequently decreases the 
expression levels of TFEB. Further experiments show that autophagic flux 
enhanced by METTL3 deficiency is TFEB dependent. In turn, TFEB regulates the 
expression levels of METTL3 and ALKBH5 in opposite directions: it induces ALKBH5 
and inhibits METTL3. TFEB binds to the ALKBH5 promoter and activates its 
transcription. In contrast, inhibition of METTL3 by TFEB does not involve 
transcriptional repression but rather downregulation of mRNA stability, thereby 
establishing a negative feedback loop. Together, our work uncovers a critical 
link between METTL3-ALKBH5 and autophagy, providing insight into the functional 
importance of the reversible mRNA m6A methylation and its modulators in ischemic 
heart disease.]]></TEXT>

mitigates chronic colitis.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by 
defective intestinal barrier integrity toward the microbiota and epithelial 
damage. Double cortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), a marker of intestinal tuft cells, 
can regulate tissue regenerative responses, but its role in epithelial repair 
during bacterial-dependent chronic colitis is unclear. We addressed this 
question using our recently developed mouse model of spontaneous 
microbiota-dependent colitis induced by mucin-type O-glycan deficiency (DKO), 
which recapitulates most features of human UC. We generated DKO mice lacking 
intestinal epithelial Dclk1 (DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC) and analyzed colitis onset and 
severity using clinical and histologic indices, immune responses by qPCR and 
immunostaining, and epithelial responses using proliferation markers and 
organoid culture. We found 3-4-week-old DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC mice developed worsened 
spontaneous colitis characterized by reduced body weight, loose stool, severe 
colon thickening, epithelial lesions, and inflammatory cell infiltrates compared 
with DKO mice. The primary defect was an impaired epithelial proliferative 
response during inflammation. Dclk1 deficiency also reduced inflammation-induced 
proliferation and growth of colon organoids ex vivo. Mechanistically, Dclk1 
expression was important for inflammation-induced Cox2 expression and 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in vivo, and PGE2 rescued proliferative 
defects in Dclk1-deficient colonic organoids. Although tuft cells were expanded 
in both DKO and DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC relative to WT mice, loss of Dclk1 was associated 
with reduced tuft cell activation (i.e., proliferation) during inflammation. 
Similar results were found in DKO vs. DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC mice at 3-6 months of age. 
Our results support that tuft cells, via Dclk1, are important responders to 
bacterial-induced colitis by enhancing epithelial repair responses, which in 
turn limits bacterial infiltration into the mucosa.]]></TEXT>

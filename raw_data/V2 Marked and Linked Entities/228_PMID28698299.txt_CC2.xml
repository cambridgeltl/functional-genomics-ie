<TEXT><![CDATA[Neat1 is a p53-inducible lincRNA essential for transformation suppression.

The p53 gene is mutated in over half of all cancers, reflecting its critical 
role as a tumor suppressor. Although p53 is a transcriptional activator that 
induces myriad target genes, those p53-inducible genes most critical for tumor 
suppression remain elusive. Here, we leveraged p53 ChIP-seq (chromatin 
immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq 
(RNA sequencing) data sets to identify new p53 target genes, focusing on the 
noncoding genome. We identify Neat1, a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) constituent of 
paraspeckles, as a p53 target gene broadly induced by mouse and human p53 in 
different cell types and by diverse stress signals. Using fibroblasts derived 
from Neat1-/- mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53 pathway. 
We found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in 
response to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in 
suppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency 
enhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the 
development of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and 
cystic lesions in KrasG12D-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes 
in gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes 
neoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large 
intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and 
cancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor 
suppression.]]></TEXT>

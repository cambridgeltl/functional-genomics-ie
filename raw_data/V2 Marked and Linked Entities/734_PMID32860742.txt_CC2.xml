<TEXT><![CDATA[Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase1 (HPK1) Mediates T Cell Dysfunction and Is a 
Druggable Target for T Cell-Based Immunotherapies.

Ameliorating T cell exhaustion and enhancing effector function are promising 
strategies for the improvement of immunotherapies. Here, we show that the 
HPK1-NFκB-Blimp1 axis mediates T cell dysfunction. High expression of MAP4K1 
(which encodes HPK1) correlates with increased T cell exhaustion and with worse 
patient survival in several cancer types. In MAP4K1KO mice, tumors grow slower 
than in wild-type mice and infiltrating T cells are less exhausted and more 
active and proliferative. We further show that genetic depletion, 
pharmacological inhibition, or proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)-mediated 
degradation of HPK1 improves the efficacy of CAR-T cell-based immunotherapies in 
diverse preclinical mouse models of hematological and solid tumors. These 
strategies are more effective than genetically depleting PD-1 in CAR-T cells. 
Thus, we demonstrate that HPK1 is a mediator of T cell dysfunction and an 
attractive druggable target to improve immune therapy responses.]]></TEXT>

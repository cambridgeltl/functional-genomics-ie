<TEXT><![CDATA[Targeting FTO Suppresses Cancer Stem Cell Maintenance and Immune Evasion.

Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), an RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) 
demethylase, plays oncogenic roles in various cancers, presenting an opportunity 
for the development of effective targeted therapeutics. Here, we report two 
potent small-molecule FTO inhibitors that exhibit strong anti-tumor effects in 
multiple types of cancers. We show that genetic depletion and pharmacological 
inhibition of FTO dramatically attenuate leukemia stem/initiating cell 
self-renewal and reprogram immune response by suppressing expression of immune 
checkpoint genes, especially LILRB4. FTO inhibition sensitizes leukemia cells to 
TÂ cell cytotoxicity and overcomes hypomethylating agent-induced immune evasion. 
Our study demonstrates that FTO plays critical roles in cancer stem cell 
self-renewal and immune evasion and highlights the broad potential of targeting 
FTO for cancer therapy.

<TEXT><![CDATA[Direct Tumor Killing and Immunotherapy through Anti-SerpinB9 Therapy.

Cancer therapies kill tumors either directly or indirectly by evoking immune 
responses and have been combined with varying levels of success. Here, we 
describe a paradigm to control cancer growth that is based on both direct tumor 
killing and the triggering of protective immunity. Genetic ablation of serine 
protease inhibitor SerpinB9 (Sb9) results in the death of tumor cells in a 
granzyme B (GrB)-dependent manner. Sb9-deficient mice exhibited protective 
TÂ cell-based host immunity to tumors in association with a decline in 
GrB-expressing immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). 
Maximal protection against tumor development was observed when the tumor and 
host were deficient in Sb9. The therapeutic utility of Sb9 inhibition was 
demonstrated by the control of tumor growth, resulting in increased survival 
times in mice. Our studies describe a molecular target that permits a 
combination of tumor ablation, interference within the TME, and immunotherapy in 
one potential modality.]]></TEXT>

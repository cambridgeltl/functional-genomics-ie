<TEXT><![CDATA[Mutant NPM1 Maintains the Leukemic State through HOX Expression.

NPM1 is the most frequently mutated gene in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML). In AML cells, NPM1 mutations result in abnormal cytoplasmic 
localization of the mutant protein (NPM1c); however, it is unknown whether NPM1c 
is required to maintain the leukemic state. Here, we show that loss of NPM1c 
from the cytoplasm, either through nuclear relocalization or targeted 
degradation, results in immediate downregulation of homeobox (HOX) genes 
followed by differentiation. Finally, we show that XPO1 inhibition relocalizes 
NPM1c to the nucleus, promotes differentiation of AML cells, and prolongs 
survival of Npm1-mutated leukemic mice. We describe an exquisite dependency of 
NPM1-mutant AML cells on NPM1c, providing the rationale for the use of nuclear 
export inhibitors in AML with mutated NPM1.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[The splicing factor U2AF1 contributes to cancer progression through a 
noncanonical role in translation regulation.

Somatic mutations in the genes encoding components of the spliceosome occur 
frequently in human neoplasms, including myeloid dysplasias and leukemias, and 
less often in solid tumors. One of the affected factors, U2AF1, is involved in 
splice site selection, and the most common change, S34F, alters a conserved 
nucleic acid-binding domain, recognition of the 3' splice site, and alternative 
splicing of many mRNAs. However, the role that this mutation plays in 
oncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we uncovered a noncanonical function of 
U2AF1, showing that it directly binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and 
negatively regulates mRNA translation. This splicing-independent role of U2AF1 
is altered by the S34F mutation, and polysome profiling indicates that the 
mutation affects translation of hundreds of mRNA. One functional consequence is 
increased synthesis of the secreted chemokine interleukin 8, which contributes 
to metastasis, inflammation, and cancer progression in mice and humans.

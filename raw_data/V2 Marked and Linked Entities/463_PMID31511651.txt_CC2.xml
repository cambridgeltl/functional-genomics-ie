Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP) is overexpressed in hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) and positively correlated with recurrence and vascular invasion. 
Here, we found that CPAP plays an important role in HCC malignancies. Functional 
characterization indicated that CPAP overexpression increases tumor growth, 
angiogenesis, and metastasis ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, overexpressed 
CPAP contributes to sorafenib resistance. Mechanical investigation showed that 
the expression level of CPAP is positively correlated with activated STAT3 in 
HCC. CPAP acts as a transcriptional coactivator of STAT3 by directly binding 
with STAT3. Interrupting the interaction between CPAP and STAT3 attenuates 
STAT3-mediated tumor growth and angiogenesis. Overexpression of CPAP upregulates 
several STAT3 target genes such as IL-8 and CD44 that are involved in 
angiogenesis, and CPAP mRNA expression is positively correlated with the levels 
of both mRNAs in HCC. Knocked-down expression of CPAP impairs IL-6-mediated 
STAT3 activation, target gene expression, cell migration, and invasion 
abilities. IL-6/STAT3-mediated angiogenesis is significantly increased by CPAP 
overexpression and can be blocked by decreased expression of IL-8. Our findings 
not only shed light on the importance of CPAP in HCC malignancies, but also 
provide potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the angiogenesis pathway 
and treating metastatic HCC.]]></TEXT>

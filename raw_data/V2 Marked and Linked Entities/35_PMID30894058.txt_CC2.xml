autophagy.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in myeloid cellular repair, destruction, 
and osteoclast differentiation; conversely, KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 [lung]) 
regulates myeloid cell activation and differentiation. To investigate the 
specific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in 
monocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine 
(3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and 
adenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells 
and multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, 
GGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these 
processes. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly 
decreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic 
differentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level 
of Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic 
differentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of 
Beclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the 
level of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid 
cell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules 
(CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27kip1). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of 
Becn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone 
activation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and 
overexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In 
addition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 
acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the 
first time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy 
process during osteoclastogenesis.]]></TEXT>

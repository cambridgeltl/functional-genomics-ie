antagonizing Nucleolin to regulate MYC expression.

The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LUCAT1 was recently reported to be upregulated 
and to play an essential role in multiple cancer types, especially colorectal 
cancer (CRC), but the molecular mechanisms of LUCAT1 in CRC are mostly 
unreported. Here, a systematic analysis of LUACT1 expression is performed with 
data from TCGA database and clinic CRC samples. LUCAT1 is identified as a 
putative oncogene, which is significantly upregulated in CRC and is associated 
with poor prognosis. Loss of LUCAT1 restricts CRC proliferative capacities in 
vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, NCL is identified as the protein binding 
partner of LUCAT1 by using chromatin isolation by RNA purification coupled with 
mass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. We also show 
that NCL directly binds to LUCAT1 via its putative G-quadruplex-forming regions 
from nucleotides 717 to 746. The interaction between LUCAT1 and NCL interferes 
NCL-mediated inhibition of MYC and promote the expression of MYC. Cells lacking 
LUCAT1 show a decreased MYC expression, and NCL knockdown rescue LUCAT1 
depletion-induced inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and MYC expression. Our 
results suggest that LUCAT1 plays a critical role in CRC cell proliferation by 
inhibiting the function of NCL via its G-quadruplex structure and may serve as a 
new prognostic biomarker and effective therapeutic target for CRC.]]></TEXT>

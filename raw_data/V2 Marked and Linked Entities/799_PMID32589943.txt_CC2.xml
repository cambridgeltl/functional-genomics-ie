<TEXT><![CDATA[PKCλ/ι Loss Induces Autophagy, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and NRF2 to Promote 
Liver Cancer Progression.

Oxidative stress plays a critical role in liver tissue damage and in 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation and progression. However, the 
mechanisms that regulate autophagy and metabolic reprogramming during reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) generation, and how ROS promote tumorigenesis, still need 
to be fully understood. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) λ/ι loss in 
hepatocytes promotes autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation. This results in 
ROS generation, which through NRF2 drives HCC through cell-autonomous and 
non-autonomous mechanisms. Although PKCλ/ι promotes tumorigenesis in 
oncogene-driven cancer models, emerging evidence demonstrate that it is a tumor 
suppressor in more complex carcinogenic processes. Consistently, PKCλ/ι levels 
negatively correlate with HCC histological tumor grade, establishing this kinase 
as a tumor suppressor in liver cancer.]]></TEXT>

targeting CUG repeats.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common type of adult muscular 
dystrophy caused by the expanded triple-nucleotides (CUG) repeats. Myoblast in 
DM1 displayed many defects, including defective myoblast differentiation, 
ribonuclear foci, and aberrant alternative splicing. Despite many were revealed 
to function in DM1, microRNAs that regulated DM1 via directly targeting the 
expanded CUG repeats were rarely reported. Here we discovered that miR-322/-503 
rescued myoblast defects in DM1 cell model by targeting the expanded CUG 
repeats. First, we studied the function of miR-322/-503 in normal C2C12 myoblast 
cells. Downregulation of miR-322/-503 significantly hindered the myoblast 
differentiation, while miR-322/-503 overexpression promoted the process. Next, 
we examined the role of miR-322/-503 in the DM1 C2C12 cell model. miR-322/-503 
was downregulated in the differentiation of DM1 C2C12 cells. When we introduced 
ectopic miR-322/-503 expression into DM1 C2C12 cells, myoblast defects were 
almost fully rescued, marked by significant improvements of myoblast 
differentiation and repressions of ribonuclear foci formation and aberrant 
alternative splicing. Then we investigated the downstream mechanism of 
miR-322/-503 in DM1. Agreeing with our previous work, Celf1 was proven to be 
miR-322/-503's target. Celf1 knockdown partially reproduced miR-322/-503's 
function in rescuing DM1 C2C12 differentiation but was unable to repress 
ribonuclear foci, suggesting other targets of miR-322/-503 existed in the DM1 
C2C12 cells. As the seed regions of miR-322 and miR-503 were complementary to 
the CUG repeats, we hypothesized that the CUG repeats were the target of 
miR-322/-503. Through expression tests, reporter assays, and colocalization 
staining, miR-322/-503 was proved to directly and specifically target the 
expanded CUG repeats in the DM1 cell model rather than the shorter ones in 
normal cells. Those results implied a potential therapeutic function of 
miR-322/-503 on DM1, which needed further investigations in the future.]]></TEXT>

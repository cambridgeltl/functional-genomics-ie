chondrocytes in osteoarthritic temporomandibular joint.

A switch from autophagy to apoptosis is implicated in chondrocytes during the 
osteoarthritis (OA) progression with currently unknown mechanism(s). In this 
study we utilized a flow fluid shear stress (FFSS) model in cultured 
chondrocytes and a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) animal model. We found 
that both FFSS and UAC actively induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in 
the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) chondrocytes, as demonstrated by dramatic 
increases in expression of HSPA5, p-EIF2AK3, p-ERN1 and ATF6. Interestingly, 
both FFSS and UAC activated not only pro-death p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS-apoptosis 
programs but also pro-survival p-ERN1-mediated autophagic flux in chondrocytes. 
Data from FFSS demonstrated that MTORC1, a downstream of p-ERN1, suppressed 
autophagy but promoted p-EIF2AK3 mediated ERS-apoptosis. Data from UAC model 
demonstrated that at early stage both the p-ERN1 and p-EIF2AK3 were activated 
and MTORC1 was inhibited in TMJ chondrocytes. At late stage, 
MTORC1-p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS apoptosis were predominant, while p-ERN1 and 
autophagic flux were inhibited. Inhibition of MTORC1 by TMJ local injection of 
rapamycin in rats or inducible ablation of MTORC1 expression selectively in 
chondrocytes in mice promoted chondrocyte autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, 
and reduced TMJ cartilage loss induced by UAC. In contrast, MTORC1 activation by 
TMJ local administration of MHY1485 or genetic deletion of Tsc1, an upstream 
MTORC1 suppressor, resulted in opposite effects. Collectively, our results 
establish that aberrant mechanical loading causes cartilage degeneration by 
activating, at least in part, the MTORC1 signaling which modulates the autophagy 
and apoptosis programs in TMJ chondrocytes. Thus, inhibition of MTORC1 provides 
a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of OA.]]></TEXT>

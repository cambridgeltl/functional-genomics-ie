<TEXT><![CDATA[CDK4/6 Inhibitors Impair Recovery from Cytotoxic Chemotherapy in Pancreatic 
Adenocarcinoma.

Inhibition of the cell-cycle kinases CDK4 and CDK6 is now part of the standard 
treatment in advanced breast cancer. CDK4/6 inhibitors, however, are not 
expected to cooperate with DNA-damaging or antimitotic chemotherapies as the 
former prevent cell-cycle entry, thus interfering with S-phase- or 
mitosis-targeting agents. Here, we report that sequential administration of 
CDK4/6 inhibitors after taxanes cooperates to prevent cellular proliferation in 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, patient-derived xenografts, and 
genetically engineered mice with Kras G12V and Cdkn2a-null mutations frequently 
observed in PDAC. This effect correlates with the repressive activity of CDK4/6 
inhibitors on homologous recombination proteins required for the recovery from 
chromosomal damage. CDK4/6 inhibitors also prevent recovery from multiple 
DNA-damaging agents, suggesting broad applicability for their sequential 
administration after available chemotherapeutic agents.]]></TEXT>

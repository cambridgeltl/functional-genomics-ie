autophagic functions.

SIRT3 (sirtuin 3), a mitochondrial protein deacetylase, maintains respiratory 
function, but its role in the regulation of innate immune defense is largely 
unknown. Herein, we show that SIRT3 coordinates mitochondrial function and 
macroautophagy/autophagy activation to promote anti-mycobacterial responses 
through PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha). SIRT3 
deficiency enhanced inflammatory responses and mitochondrial dysfunction, 
leading to defective host defense and pathological inflammation during 
mycobacterial infection. Antibody-mediated depletion of polymorphonuclear 
neutrophils significantly increased protection against mycobacterial infection 
in sirt3-/- mice. In addition, mitochondrial oxidative stress promoted excessive 
inflammation induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in sirt3-/- 
macrophages. Notably, SIRT3 was essential for the enhancement of PPARA, a key 
regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy activation in the context 
of infection. Importantly, overexpression of either PPARA or TFEB (transcription 
factor EB) in sirt3-/- macrophages recovered antimicrobial activity through 
autophagy activation. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of SIRT3 enhanced 
antibacterial autophagy and functional mitochondrial pools during mycobacterial 
infection. Finally, the levels of SIRT3 and PPARA were downregulated and 
inversely correlated with TNF (tumor necrosis factor) levels in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells from tuberculosis patients. Collectively, these data 
demonstrate a previously unappreciated function of SIRT3 in orchestrating 
mitochondrial and autophagic functions to promote antimycobacterial responses. ]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Direct Phosphorylation and Stabilization of MYC by Aurora B Kinase Promote 
T-cell Leukemogenesis.

Deregulation of MYC plays an essential role in T cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (T-ALL), yet the mechanisms underlying its deregulation remain elusive. 
Herein, we identify a molecular mechanism responsible for reciprocal activation 
between Aurora B kinase (AURKB) and MYC. AURKB directly phosphorylates MYC at 
serine 67, counteracting GSK3β-directed threonine 58 phosphorylation and 
subsequent FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation. Stabilized MYC, in concert 
with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (TAL1), directly activates AURKB 
transcription, constituting a positive feedforward loop that reinforces 
MYC-regulated oncogenic programs. Therefore, inhibitors of AURKB induce 
prominent MYC degradation concomitant with robust leukemia cell death. These 
findings reveal an AURKB-MYC regulatory circuit that underlies T cell 
leukemogenesis, and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of oncogenic 
MYC via AURKB inhibition.]]></TEXT>

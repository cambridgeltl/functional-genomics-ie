<TEXT><![CDATA[Zc3h13/Flacc is required for adenosine methylation by bridging the mRNA-binding 
factor Rbm15/Spenito to the m(6)A machinery component Wtap/Fl(2)d.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification in eukaryotes, 
playing crucial roles in multiple biological processes. m6A is catalyzed by the 
activity of methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3), which depends on additional 
proteins whose precise functions remain poorly understood. Here we identified 
Zc3h13 (zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 13)/Flacc [Fl(2)d-associated 
complex component] as a novel interactor of m6A methyltransferase complex 
components in Drosophila and mice. Like other components of this complex, Flacc 
controls m6A levels and is involved in sex determination in Drosophila We 
demonstrate that Flacc promotes m6A deposition by bridging Fl(2)d to the 
mRNA-binding factor Nito. Altogether, our work advances the molecular 
understanding of conservation and regulation of the m6A machinery.]]></TEXT>

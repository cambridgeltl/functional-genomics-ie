Tracts against SARS-CoV-2.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective 
vaccine a global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a 
chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike 
protein (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of 
ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune 
responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but 
does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and 
induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In 
contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of 
neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) 
and TÂ cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both 
the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration of 
ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.]]></TEXT>

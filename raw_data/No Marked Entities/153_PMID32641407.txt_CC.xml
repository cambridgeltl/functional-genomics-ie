Using BRCA2 Exon 3 as a Model System.

BRCA2 is a clinically actionable gene implicated in breast and ovarian cancer 
predisposition that has become a high priority target for improving the 
classification of variants of unknown significance (VUS). Among all BRCA2 VUS, 
those causing partial/leaky splicing defects are the most challenging to 
classify because the minimal level of full-length (FL) transcripts required for 
normal function remains to be established. Here, we explored BRCA2 exon 3 
(BRCA2e3) as a model for calibrating variant-induced spliceogenicity and 
estimating thresholds for BRCA2 haploinsufficiency. In silico predictions, 
minigene splicing assays, patients' RNA analyses, a mouse embryonic stem cell 
(mESC) complementation assay and retrieval of patient-related information were 
combined to determine the minimal requirement of FL BRCA2 transcripts. Of 100 
BRCA2e3 variants tested in the minigene assay, 64 were found to be spliceogenic, 
causing mild to severe RNA defects. Splicing defects were also confirmed in 
patients' RNA when available. Analysis of a neutral leaky variant (c.231T>G) 
showed that a reduction of approximately 60% of FL BRCA2 transcripts from a 
mutant allele does not cause any increase in cancer risk. Moreover, data 
obtained from mESCs suggest that variants causing a decline in FL BRCA2 with 
approximately 30% of wild-type are not pathogenic, given that mESCs are fully 
viable and resistant to DNA-damaging agents in those conditions. In contrast, 
mESCs producing lower relative amounts of FL BRCA2 exhibited either null or 
hypomorphic phenotypes. Overall, our findings are likely to have broader 
implications on the interpretation of BRCA2 variants affecting the splicing 
pattern of other essential exons.]]></TEXT>

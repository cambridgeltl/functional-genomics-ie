development.

c-Myc (Myc) is a master transcription factor that is often deregulated and 
highly expressed by at least 50% of cancers. In many cases, Myc protein levels 
correlate with resistance to therapy and poor prognosis. However, effective 
direct inhibition of Myc by pharmacologic approaches has remained unachievable. 
Here, we identify MAP3K13 as a positive regulator of Myc to promote tumor 
development. Our findings show that MAP3K13 upregulation is predictive of poor 
outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Mechanistically, 
MAP3K13 phosphorylates the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 at Ser12 to decrease its 
polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This newly stabilized TRIM25 
then directly ubiquitinates Lys412 of FBXW7α, a core subunit of the 
SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex involved in Myc ubiquitination, 
thereby stabilizing Myc. Together, these results reveal a novel regulatory 
pathway that supervises Myc protein stability via the MAP3K13-TRIM25-FBXW7α 
signaling axis. In addition, they provide a potential therapeutic target in Myc 
over-expressing human cancers.

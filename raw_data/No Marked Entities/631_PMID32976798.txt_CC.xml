Macrophages in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

We employed scRNA sequencing to extensively characterize the cellular landscape 
of human liver from development to disease. Analysis of ∼212,000 cells 
representing human fetal, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and mouse liver 
revealed remarkable fetal-like reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. 
Specifically, the HCC ecosystem displayed features reminiscent of fetal 
development, including re-emergence of fetal-associated endothelial cells 
(PLVAP/VEGFR2) and fetal-like (FOLR2) tumor-associated macrophages. In a 
cross-species comparative analysis, we discovered remarkable similarity between 
mouse embryonic, fetal-liver, and tumor macrophages. Spatial transcriptomics 
further revealed a shared onco-fetal ecosystem between fetal liver and HCC. 
Furthermore, gene regulatory analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and in vitro 
functional assays implicated VEGF and NOTCH signaling in maintaining onco-fetal 
ecosystem. Taken together, we report a shared immunosuppressive onco-fetal 
ecosystem in fetal liver and HCC. Our results unravel a previously unexplored 
onco-fetal reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem, provide novel targets for 
therapeutic interventions in HCC, and open avenues for identifying similar 
paradigms in other cancers and disease.

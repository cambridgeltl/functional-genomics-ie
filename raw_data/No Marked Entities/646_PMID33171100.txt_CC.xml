<TEXT><![CDATA[Multi-Omics Resolves a Sharp Disease-State Shift between Mild and Moderate 
COVID-19.

We present an integrated analysis of the clinical measurements, immune cells, 
and plasma multi-omics of 139 COVID-19 patients representing all levels of 
disease severity, from serial blood draws collected during the first week of 
infection following diagnosis. We identify a major shift between mild and 
moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied 
by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within 
this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune 
cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We 
condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how 
different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This 
immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition 
changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition 
between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may 
provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.]]></TEXT>

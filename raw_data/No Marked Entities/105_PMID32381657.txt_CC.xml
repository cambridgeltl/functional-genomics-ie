<TEXT><![CDATA[Synaptic Communication in Brain Cancer.

Increasing evidence indicates that the nervous system plays a critical role in 
cancer progression. This is particularly true in cancers that occur within the 
central nervous system. Communication between neurons and cancer cells is a 
fundamental component of brain cancer pathophysiology, both for primary gliomas 
and for brain metastases. Neuronal activity drives growth of glial malignancies 
through secreted growth factors and through direct electrochemical synaptic 
communication. Reciprocally, brain cancers influence neuronal function, 
increasing neuronal activity and modulating the function of the circuits into 
which the cancer cells structurally and electrically integrate. Advancing 
understanding of neuron-cancer interactions will elucidate new therapeutic 
strategies for these presently lethal brain cancers.]]></TEXT>

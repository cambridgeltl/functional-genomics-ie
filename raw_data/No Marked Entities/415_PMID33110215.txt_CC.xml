<TEXT><![CDATA[p53-dependent elimination of aneuploid mitotic offspring by entosis.

Entosis was proposed to promote aneuploidy and genome instability by 
cell-in-cell mediated engulfment in tumor cells. We reported here, in epithelial 
cells, that entosis coupled with mitotic arrest functions to counteract genome 
instability by targeting aneuploid mitotic progenies for engulfment and 
elimination. We found that the formation of cell-in-cell structures associated 
with prolonged mitosis, which was sufficient to induce entosis. This process was 
controlled by the tumor suppressor p53 (wild-type) that upregulates Rnd3 
expression in response to DNA damages associated with prolonged metaphase. 
Rnd3-compartmentalized RhoA activities accumulated during prolonged metaphase to 
drive cell-in-cell formation. Remarkably, this prolonged mitosis-induced entosis 
selectively targets non-diploid progenies for internalization, blockade of which 
increased aneuploidy. Thus, our work uncovered a heretofore unrecognized 
mechanism of mitotic surveillance for entosis, which eliminates newly born 
abnormal daughter cells in a p53-dependent way, implicating in the maintenance 
of genome integrity.]]></TEXT>

myogenic autophagy.

Muscle differentiation is a crucial process controlling muscle development and 
homeostasis. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) rapidly increase and 
function as critical cell signaling intermediates during the muscle 
differentiation. However, it has not yet been elucidated how they control 
myogenic signaling. Autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, is 
importantly recognized as intracellular remodeling mechanism of cellular 
organelles during muscle differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that the mtROS 
stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) cascade, and the activated mTORC1 subsequently induced autophagic 
signaling via phosphorylation of uncoordinated-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at serine 
317 and upregulation of Atg proteins to prompt muscle differentiation. Treatment 
with MitoQ or rapamycin impaired both phosphorylation of ULK1 and expression of 
Atg proteins. Therefore, we propose a novel regulatory paradigm in which mtROS 
are required to initiate autophagic reconstruction of cellular organization 
through mTOR activation in muscle differentiation.]]></TEXT>

Homeostasis and Enteritis.

Throughout a 24-h period, the small intestine (SI) is exposed to diurnally 
varying food- and microbiome-derived antigenic burdens but maintains a strict 
immune homeostasis, which when perturbed in genetically susceptible individuals, 
may lead to Crohn disease. Herein, we demonstrate that dietary content and 
rhythmicity regulate the diurnally shifting SI epithelial cell (SIEC) 
transcriptional landscape through modulation of the SI microbiome. We exemplify 
this concept with SIEC major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is 
diurnally modulated by distinct mucosal-adherent SI commensals, while supporting 
downstream diurnal activity of intra-epithelial IL-10+ lymphocytes regulating 
the SI barrier function. Disruption of this diurnally regulated 
diet-microbiome-MHC class II-IL-10-epithelial barrier axis by circadian clock 
disarrangement, alterations in feeding time or content, or epithelial-specific 
MHC class II depletion leads to an extensive microbial product influx, driving 
Crohn-like enteritis. Collectively, we highlight nutritional features that 
modulate SI microbiome, immunity, and barrier function and identify dietary, 
epithelial, and immune checkpoints along this axis to be potentially exploitable 
in future Crohn disease interventions.]]></TEXT>

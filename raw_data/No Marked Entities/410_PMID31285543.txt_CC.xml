Cell fate decision upon prolonged mitotic arrest induced by 
microtubule-targeting agents depends on the activity of the tumor suppressor and 
F-box protein FBXW7. FBXW7 promotes mitotic cell death and prevents premature 
escape from mitosis through mitotic slippage. Mitotic slippage is a process that 
can cause chemoresistance and tumor relapse. Therefore, understanding the 
mechanisms that regulate the balance between mitotic cell death and mitotic 
slippage is an important task. Here we report that FBXW7 protein levels markedly 
decline during extended mitotic arrest. FBXO45 binds to a conserved acidic 
N-terminal motif of FBXW7 specifically under a prolonged delay in mitosis, 
leading to ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of FBXW7 by the 
FBXO45-MYCBP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, we find that FBXO45-MYCBP2 
counteracts FBXW7 in that it promotes mitotic slippage and prevents cell death 
in mitosis. Targeting this interaction represents a promising strategy to 
prevent chemotherapy resistance.]]></TEXT>

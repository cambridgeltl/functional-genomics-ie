<TEXT><![CDATA[Control of noncoding RNA production and histone levels by a 5' tRNA fragment.

Small RNAs derived from mature tRNAs, referred to as tRNA fragments or "tRFs," 
are an emerging class of regulatory RNAs with poorly understood functions. We 
recently identified a role for one specific tRF-5' tRF-Gly-GCC, or tRF-GG-as a 
repressor of genes associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, but the 
mechanistic basis for this regulation was unknown. Here, we show that tRF-GG 
plays a role in production of a wide variety of noncoding RNAs-snoRNAs, scaRNAs, 
and snRNAs-that are dependent on Cajal bodies for stability and activity. Among 
these noncoding RNAs, regulation of the U7 snRNA by tRF-GG modulates 
heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional repression of MERVL elements by 
supporting an adequate supply of histone proteins. Importantly, the effects of 
inhibiting tRF-GG on histone mRNA levels, on activity of a histone 3' UTR 
reporter, and ultimately on MERVL regulation could all be suppressed by 
manipulating U7 RNA levels. We additionally show that the related RNA-binding 
proteins hnRNPF and hnRNPH bind directly to tRF-GG, and are required for Cajal 
body biogenesis, positioning these proteins as strong candidates for effectors 
of tRF-GG function in vivo. Together, our data reveal a conserved mechanism for 
5' tRNA fragment control of noncoding RNA biogenesis and, consequently, global 
chromatin organization.]]></TEXT>

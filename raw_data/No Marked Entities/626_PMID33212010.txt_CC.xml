<TEXT><![CDATA[Proteogenomic Landscape of Breast Cancer Tumorigenesis and Targeted Therapy.

The integration of mass spectrometry-based proteomics with next-generation DNA 
and RNA sequencing profiles tumors more comprehensively. Here this 
"proteogenomics" approach was applied to 122 treatment-naive primary breast 
cancers accrued to preserve post-translational modifications, including protein 
phosphorylation and acetylation. Proteogenomics challenged standard breast 
cancer diagnoses, provided detailed analysis of the ERBB2 amplicon, defined 
tumor subsets that could benefit from immune checkpoint therapy, and allowed 
more accurate assessment of Rb status for prediction of CDK4/6 inhibitor 
responsiveness. Phosphoproteomics profiles uncovered novel associations between 
tumor suppressor loss and targetable kinases. Acetylproteome analysis 
highlighted acetylation on key nuclear proteins involved in the DNA damage 
response and revealed cross-talk between cytoplasmic and mitochondrial 
acetylation and metabolism. Our results underscore the potential of 
proteogenomics for clinical investigation of breast cancer through more accurate 
annotation of targetable pathways and biological features of this remarkably 
heterogeneous malignancy.]]></TEXT>

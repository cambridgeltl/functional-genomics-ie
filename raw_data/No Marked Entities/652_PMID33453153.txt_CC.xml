<TEXT><![CDATA[Infection trains the host for microbiota-enhanced resistance to pathogens.

The microbiota shields the host against infections in a process known as 
colonization resistance. How infections themselves shape this fundamental 
process remains largely unknown. Here, we show that gut microbiota from 
previously infected hosts display enhanced resistance to infection. This 
long-term functional remodeling is associated with altered bile acid metabolism 
leading to the expansion of taxa that utilize the sulfonic acid taurine. 
Notably, supplying exogenous taurine alone is sufficient to induce this 
alteration in microbiota function and enhance resistance. Mechanistically, 
taurine potentiates the microbiota's production of sulfide, an inhibitor of 
cellular respiration, which is key to host invasion by numerous pathogens. As 
such, pharmaceutical sequestration of sulfide perturbs the microbiota's 
composition and promotes pathogen invasion. Together, this work reveals a 
process by which the host, triggered by infection, can deploy taurine as a 
nutrient to nourish and train the microbiota, promoting its resistance to 
subsequent infection.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Large-Scale Topological Changes Restrain Malignant Progression in Colorectal 
Cancer.

Widespread changes to DNA methylation and chromatin are well documented in 
cancer, but the fate of higher-order chromosomal structure remains obscure. Here 
we integrated topological maps for colon tumors and normal colons with 
epigenetic, transcriptional, and imaging data to characterize alterations to 
chromatin loops, topologically associated domains, and large-scale compartments. 
We found that spatial partitioning of the open and closed genome compartments is 
profoundly compromised in tumors. This reorganization is accompanied by 
compartment-specific hypomethylation and chromatin changes. Additionally, we 
identify a compartment at the interface between the canonical A and B 
compartments that is reorganized in tumors. Remarkably, similar shifts were 
evident in non-malignant cells that have accumulated excess divisions. Our 
analyses suggest that these topological changes repress stemness and invasion 
programs while inducing anti-tumor immunity genes and may therefore restrain 
malignant progression. Our findings call into question the conventional view 
that tumor-associated epigenomic alterations are primarily oncogenic.]]></TEXT>

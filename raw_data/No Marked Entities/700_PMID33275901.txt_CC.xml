<TEXT><![CDATA[Mapping the Degradable Kinome Provides a Resource for Expedited Degrader 
Development.

Targeted protein degradation (TPD) refers to the use of small molecules to 
induce ubiquitin-dependent degradation of proteins. TPD is of interest in drug 
development, as it can address previously inaccessible targets. However, 
degrader discovery and optimization remains an inefficient process due to a lack 
of understanding of the relative importance of the key molecular events required 
to induce target degradation. Here, we use chemo-proteomics to annotate the 
degradable kinome. Our expansive dataset provides chemical leads for âˆ¼200 
kinases and demonstrates that the current practice of starting from the highest 
potency binder is an ineffective method for discovering active compounds. We 
develop multitargeted degraders to answer fundamental questions about the 
ubiquitin proteasome system, uncovering that kinase degradation is p97 
dependent. This work will not only fuel kinase degrader discovery, but also 
provides a blueprint for evaluating targeted degradation across entire gene 
families to accelerate understanding of TPD beyond the kinome.

Transferring Kynurenine and AhR Activation.

Despite the clinical successes fostered by immune checkpoint inhibitors, 
mechanisms underlying PD-1 upregulation in tumor-infiltrating T cells remain an 
enigma. Here, we show that tumor-repopulating cells (TRCs) drive PD-1 
upregulation in CD8+ T cells through a transcellular kynurenine (Kyn)-aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Interferon-γ produced by CD8+ T cells 
stimulates release of high levels of Kyn produced by TRCs, which is transferred 
into adjacent CD8+ T cells via the transporters SLC7A8 and PAT4. Kyn induces and 
activates AhR and thereby upregulates PD-1 expression. This Kyn-AhR pathway is 
confirmed in both tumor-bearing mice and cancer patients and its blockade 
enhances antitumor adoptive T cell therapy efficacy. Thus, we uncovered a 
mechanism of PD-1 upregulation with potential tumor immunotherapeutic 
applications.]]></TEXT>

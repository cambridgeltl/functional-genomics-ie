Associations with Age and Disease Severity.

Limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific 
immune responses and COVID-19 disease severity. We completed a combined 
examination of all three branches of adaptive immunity at the level of 
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in 
acute and convalescent subjects. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were 
each associated with milder disease. Coordinated SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive 
immune responses were associated with milder disease, suggesting roles for both 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in protective immunity in COVID-19. Notably, coordination 
of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific responses was disrupted in individuals ≥ 65 years 
old. Scarcity of naive T cells was also associated with aging and poor disease 
outcomes. A parsimonious explanation is that coordinated CD4+ T cell, CD8+ 
T cell, and antibody responses are protective, but uncoordinated responses 
frequently fail to control disease, with a connection between aging and impaired 
adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.]]></TEXT>

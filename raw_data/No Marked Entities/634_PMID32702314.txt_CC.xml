<TEXT><![CDATA[Spatial Transcriptomics and In Situ Sequencing to Study Alzheimer's Disease.

Although complex inflammatory-like alterations are observed around the amyloid 
plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD), little is known about the molecular changes 
and cellular interactions that characterize this response. We investigate here, 
in an AD mouse model, the transcriptional changes occurring in tissue domains in 
a 100-Î¼m diameter around amyloid plaques using spatial transcriptomics. We 
demonstrate early alterations in a gene co-expression network enriched for 
myelin and oligodendrocyte genes (OLIGs), whereas a multicellular gene 
co-expression network of plaque-induced genes (PIGs) involving the complement 
system, oxidative stress, lysosomes, and inflammation is prominent in the later 
phase of the disease. We confirm the majority of the observed alterations at the 
cellular level using in situ sequencing on mouse and human brain sections. 
Genome-wide spatial transcriptomics analysis provides an unprecedented approach 
to untangle the dysregulated cellular network in the vicinity of pathogenic 
hallmarks of AD and other brain diseases.]]></TEXT>

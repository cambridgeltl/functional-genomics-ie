<TEXT><![CDATA[Pan-Genome of Wild and Cultivated Soybeans.

Soybean is one of the most important vegetable oil and protein feed crops. To 
capture the entire genomic diversity, it is needed to construct a complete 
high-quality pan-genome from diverse soybean accessions. In this study, we 
performed individual de novo genome assemblies for 26 representative soybeans 
that were selected from 2,898 deeply sequenced accessions. Using these assembled 
genomes together with three previously reported genomes, we constructed a 
graph-based genome and performed pan-genome analysis, which identified numerous 
genetic variations that cannot be detected by direct mapping of short sequence 
reads onto a single reference genome. The structural variations from the 2,898 
accessions that were genotyped based on the graph-based genome and the RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq) data from the representative 26 accessions helped to link 
genetic variations to candidate genes that are responsible for important traits. 
This pan-genome resource will promote evolutionary and functional genomics 
studies in soybean.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[A Probabilistic Classification Tool for Genetic Subtypes of Diffuse Large B Cell 
Lymphoma with Therapeutic Implications.

The development of precision medicine approaches for diffuse large B cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) is confounded by its pronounced genetic, phenotypic, and 
clinical heterogeneity. Recent multiplatform genomic studies revealed the 
existence of genetic subtypes of DLBCL using clustering methodologies. Here, we 
describe an algorithm that determines the probability that a patient's lymphoma 
belongs to one of seven genetic subtypes based on its genetic features. This 
classification reveals genetic similarities between these DLBCL subtypes and 
various indolent and extranodal lymphoma types, suggesting a shared 
pathogenesis. These genetic subtypes also have distinct gene expression 
profiles, immune microenvironments, and outcomes following immunochemotherapy. 
Functional analysis of genetic subtype models highlights distinct 
vulnerabilities to targeted therapy, supporting the use of this classification 
in precision medicine trials.]]></TEXT>

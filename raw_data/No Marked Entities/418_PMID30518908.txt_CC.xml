cervical cancer.

Cervical cancer (CC) is the third most common carcinoma and the fourth leading 
cause of cancer-associated mortality in women. Here, we report that MDM2-DHX9 
interaction mediates CC motility and angiogenesis in a long noncoding 
RNA-dependent fashion. A long noncoding RNA, named lnc-CCDST, is significantly 
downregulated in CC tissues, and binds to pro-oncogenic DHX9. DHX9 is 
upregulated in CC tissue, and promotes CC cell motility and angiogenesis. The 
lnc-CCDST and DHX9 interaction promotes DHX9 degradation through the ubiquitin 
proteasome pathway. Furthermore, DHX9 bound to E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, and 
this interaction is enhanced by lnc-CCDST. Thus, lnc-CCDST promotes DHX9 
degradation by serving as a scaffold to facilitate the formation of MDM2 and 
DHX9 complexes. Moreover, HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 abolish the expression of 
lnc-CCDST resulting in the increase of DHX9. Our results have revealed a novel 
mechanism by which high-risk HPVs promote motility and angiogenesis of CC by 
inhibiting expression of lnc-CCDST to disrupt MDM2 and DHX9 interaction, and 
DHX9 degradation, and identified a potential therapeutic target for CC.]]></TEXT>

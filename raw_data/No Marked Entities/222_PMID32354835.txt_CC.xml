<TEXT><![CDATA[Molecular structures and mechanisms of DNA break processing in mouse meiosis.

Exonucleolytic resection, critical to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs) by 
recombination, is not well understood, particularly in mammalian meiosis. Here, 
we define structures of resected DSBs in mouse spermatocytes genome-wide at 
nucleotide resolution. Resection tracts averaged 1100 nt, but with substantial 
fine-scale heterogeneity at individual hot spots. Surprisingly, EXO1 is not the 
major 5' â†’ 3' exonuclease, but the DSB-responsive kinase ATM proved a key 
regulator of both initiation and extension of resection. In wild type, apparent 
intermolecular recombination intermediates clustered near to but offset from DSB 
positions, consistent with joint molecules with incompletely invaded 3' ends. 
Finally, we provide evidence for PRDM9-dependent chromatin remodeling leading to 
increased accessibility at recombination sites. Our findings give insight into 
the mechanisms of DSB processing and repair in meiotic chromatin.]]></TEXT>

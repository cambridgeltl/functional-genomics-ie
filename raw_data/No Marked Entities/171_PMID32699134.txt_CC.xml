Survival in Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.

The respective antitumoral and protumoral roles of M1 and M2 tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAM) typify the complexity of macrophage function in cancer. In 
lung cancer, density and topology of distinct TAM phenotypes at the tumor center 
(TC) versus the invasive margin (IM) are largely unknown. Here, we investigated 
TAM subtype density and distribution between TC and IM in human lung cancer and 
TAM associations with overall survival. Macrophages isolated from adjacent 
nontumor tissue (NM), the TC (TC-TAM), and the IM (IM-TAM) were analyzed with 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Lung tumor tissue microarrays from 104 patient samples 
were constructed. M1 and M2 TAMs were identified using multiplex 
immunofluorescence staining and a tumor cell-TAM proximity analysis was 
performed. RNA-seq identified marked differences among NM, TC-TAM, and IM-TAM. 
On the basis of a panel of five selected markers (CD68, IL12, CCR7, CD163, and 
ALOX15), M2 predominance over M1 and M2 proximity to tumor cells was observed, 
especially at IM. Tumor cell proximity to TAM was linked with tumor cell 
survival and hypoxia was associated with accumulation of M2 TAM. Notably, lower 
density of M1 TC-TAM and higher proximity of tumor cells to M2 IM-TAM or lower 
proximity to M1 IM-TAM were linked with poor survival. In addition, three novel 
molecules (UBXN4, MFSD12, and ACTR6) from RNA-seq served as potential prognostic 
markers for lung cancer, and M2 predominance and juxtaposition of M2 TAM near 
tumor cells were associated with poor survival. Together, our results reveal the 
marked heterogeneity of TAM populations in different tumor regions, with M2 TAM 
predominance, particularly at IM. ]]></TEXT>

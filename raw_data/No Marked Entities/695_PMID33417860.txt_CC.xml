<TEXT><![CDATA[Colorectal Cancer Cells Enter a Diapause-like DTP State to Survive Chemotherapy.

Cancer cells enter a reversible drug-tolerant persister (DTP) state to evade 
death from chemotherapy and targeted agents. It is increasingly appreciated that 
DTPs are important drivers of therapy failure and tumor relapse. We combined 
cellular barcoding and mathematical modeling in patient-derived colorectal 
cancer models to identify and characterize DTPs in response to chemotherapy. 
Barcode analysis revealed no loss of clonal complexity of tumors that entered 
the DTP state and recurred following treatment cessation. Our data fit a 
mathematical model where all cancer cells, and not a small subpopulation, 
possess an equipotent capacity to become DTPs. Mechanistically, we determined 
that DTPs display remarkable transcriptional and functional similarities to 
diapause, a reversible state of suspended embryonic development triggered by 
unfavorable environmental conditions. Our study provides insight into how cancer 
cells use a developmentally conserved mechanism to drive the DTP state, pointing 
to novel therapeutic opportunities to target DTPs.]]></TEXT>

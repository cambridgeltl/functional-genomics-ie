microscopy.

The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become 
an ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying 
symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR 
diagnostics can augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made 
rapid, portable, and accurate. Here, we report the development of an 
amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from 
nasal swab RNA that can be read with a mobile phone microscope. The assay 
achieved ∼100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 30 min of measurement time and 
accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of positive clinical samples in 
under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 RNA to improve sensitivity 
and specificity and directly quantified viral load using enzyme kinetics. 
Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay has the 
potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2.]]></TEXT>

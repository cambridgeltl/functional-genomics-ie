Stromal Cells of Human Colorectal Cancer.

To what extent stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are transformed 
by colorectal cancer (CRC) cells is unexplored. To dissect alterations in these 
non-malignant cells, we performed single-cell multiomics sequencing of 21 
patients with microsatellite-stable CRCs and 6 cancer-free, elderly individuals. 
Surprisingly, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are prevalent in immune 
cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in both the TME and the normal tissues 
of each individual. Moreover, the proportions of fibroblasts with SCNAs in 
tumors (11.1%-47.7%) are much higher than those in adjacent normal tissues 
(1.1%-10.6%), with gain of chromosome 7 strongly enriched in the TME, clearly 
indicating clonal expansion. Furthermore, five genes (BGN, RCN3, TAGLN, MYL9, 
and TPM2) are identified as fibroblast-specific biomarkers of poorer prognosis 
of CRC. Our study provides evidence and functional relevance of pervasive 
genomic alterations in the stromal cells of TME in CRC.]]></TEXT>

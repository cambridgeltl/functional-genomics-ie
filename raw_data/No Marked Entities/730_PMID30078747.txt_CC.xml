Patients.

Our comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing across 32 The Cancer Genome 
Atlas cancer types from 8,705 patients detects alternative splicing events and 
tumor variants by reanalyzing RNA and whole-exome sequencing data. Tumors have 
up to 30% more alternative splicing events than normal samples. Association 
analysis of somatic variants with alternative splicing events confirmed known 
trans associations with variants in SF3B1 and U2AF1 and identified additional 
trans-acting variants (e.g., TADA1, PPP2R1A). Many tumors have thousands of 
alternative splicing events not detectable in normal samples; on average, we 
identified ≈930 exon-exon junctions ("neojunctions") in tumors not typically 
found in GTEx normals. From Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium data 
available for breast and ovarian tumor samples, we confirmed ≈1.7 neojunction- 
and ≈0.6 single nucleotide variant-derived peptides per tumor sample that are 
also predicted major histocompatibility complex-I binders ("putative 
neoantigens").]]></TEXT>

There is an unmet clinical need for improved tissue and liquid biopsy tools for 
cancer detection. We investigated the proteomic profile of extracellular 
vesicles and particles (EVPs) in 426 human samples from tissue explants (TEs), 
plasma, and other bodily fluids. Among traditional exosome markers, CD9, HSPA8, 
ALIX, and HSP90AB1 represent pan-EVP markers, while ACTB, MSN, and RAP1B are 
novel pan-EVP markers. To confirm that EVPs are ideal diagnostic tools, we 
analyzed proteomes of TE- (n = 151) and plasma-derived (n = 120) EVPs. 
Comparison of TE EVPs identified proteins (e.g., VCAN, TNC, and THBS2) that 
distinguish tumors from normal tissues with 90% sensitivity/94% specificity. 
Machine-learning classification of plasma-derived EVP cargo, including 
immunoglobulins, revealed 95% sensitivity/90% specificity in detecting cancer. 
Finally, we defined a panel of tumor-type-specific EVP proteins in TEs and 
plasma, which can classify tumors of unknown primary origin. Thus, EVP proteins 
can serve as reliable biomarkers for cancer detection and determining cancer 
type.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Protein aggregation mediates stoichiometry of protein complexes in aneuploid 
cells.

Aneuploidy, a condition characterized by chromosome gains and losses, causes 
reduced fitness and numerous cellular stresses, including increased protein 
aggregation. Here, we identify protein complex stoichiometry imbalances as a 
major cause of protein aggregation in aneuploid cells. Subunits of protein 
complexes encoded on excess chromosomes aggregate in aneuploid cells, which is 
suppressed when expression of other subunits is coordinately altered. We further 
show that excess subunits are either degraded or aggregate and that protein 
aggregation is nearly as effective as protein degradation at lowering levels of 
excess proteins. Our study explains why proteotoxic stress is a universal 
feature of the aneuploid state and reveals protein aggregation as a form of 
dosage compensation to cope with disproportionate expression of protein complex 
subunits.]]></TEXT>

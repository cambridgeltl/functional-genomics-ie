<TEXT><![CDATA[Emerging views of mitophagy in immunity and autoimmune diseases.

Mitophagy is a vital form of autophagy for selective removal of dysfunctional or 
redundant mitochondria. Accumulating evidence implicates elimination of 
dysfunctional mitochondria as a powerful means employed by autophagy to keep the 
immune system in check. The process of mitophagy may restrict inflammatory 
cytokine secretion and directly regulate mitochondrial antigen presentation and 
immune cell homeostasis. In this review, we describe distinctive pathways of 
mammalian mitophagy and highlight recent advances relevant to its function in 
immunity. In addition, we further discuss the direct and indirect evidence 
linking mitophagy to inflammation and autoimmunity underlying the pathogenesis 
of autoimmune diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), systemic 
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).]]></TEXT>

We report proteogenomic analysis of diffuse gastric cancers (GCs) in young 
populations. Phosphoproteome data elucidated signaling pathways associated with 
somatic mutations based on mutation-phosphorylation correlations. Moreover, 
correlations between mRNA and protein abundances provided potential oncogenes 
and tumor suppressors associated with patient survival. Furthermore, integrated 
clustering of mRNA, protein, phosphorylation, and N-glycosylation data 
identified four subtypes of diffuse GCs. Distinguishing these subtypes was 
possible by proteomic data. Four subtypes were associated with proliferation, 
immune response, metabolism, and invasion, respectively; and associations of the 
subtypes with immune- and invasion-related pathways were identified mainly by 
phosphorylation and N-glycosylation data. Therefore, our proteogenomic analysis 
provides additional information beyond genomic analyses, which can improve 
understanding of cancer biology and patient stratification in diffuse GCs.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[ROS Promotes Cancer Cell Survival through Calcium Signaling.

To avoid reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death, cancer cells increase 
their antioxidant defense system. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Takahashi etÂ al. 
identify a novel, non-canonical oxidative stress defense mechanism involving 
TRPA1, a redox-sensitive Ca2+ channel, and the upregulation of anti-apoptotic 
pathways to promote cancer cell survival.]]></TEXT>

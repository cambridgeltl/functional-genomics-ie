Malignancies.

Mitochondrial apoptosis can be effectively targeted in lymphoid malignancies 
with the FDA-approved B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitor venetoclax, but 
resistance to this agent is emerging. We show that venetoclax resistance in 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with complex clonal shifts. To 
identify determinants of resistance, we conducted parallel genome-scale screens 
of the BCL-2-driven OCI-Ly1 lymphoma cell line after venetoclax exposure along 
with integrated expression profiling and functional characterization of 
drug-resistant and engineered cell lines. We identified regulators of lymphoid 
transcription and cellular energy metabolism as drivers of venetoclax resistance 
in addition to the known involvement by BCL-2 family members, which were 
confirmed in patient samples. Our data support the implementation of 
combinatorial therapy with metabolic modulators to address venetoclax 
resistance.]]></TEXT>

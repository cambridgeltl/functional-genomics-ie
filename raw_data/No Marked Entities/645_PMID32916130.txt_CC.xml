<TEXT><![CDATA[A Quantitative Proteome Map of the Human Body.

Determining protein levels in each tissue and how they compare with RNA levels 
is important for understanding human biology and disease as well as regulatory 
processes that control protein levels. We quantified the relative protein levels 
from over 12,000 genes across 32 normal human tissues. Tissue-specific or 
tissue-enriched proteins were identified and compared to transcriptome data. 
Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode tissue-specific proteins. 
Discordance of RNA and protein enrichment revealed potential sites of synthesis 
and action of secreted proteins. The tissue-specific distribution of proteins 
also provides an in-depth view of complex biological events that require the 
interplay of multiple tissues. Most importantly, our study demonstrated that 
protein tissue-enrichment information can explain phenotypes of genetic 
diseases, which cannot be obtained by transcript information alone. Overall, our 
results demonstrate how understanding protein levels can provide insights into 
regulation, secretome, metabolism, and human diseases.]]></TEXT>

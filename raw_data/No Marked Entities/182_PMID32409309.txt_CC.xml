Cell-Cycle Regulators.

The Hippo pathway regulates cell proliferation and organ size through control of 
the transcriptional regulators YAP (yes-associated protein) and TAZ. Upon 
extracellular stimuli such as cell-cell contact, the pathway negatively 
regulates YAP through cytoplasmic sequestration. Under conditions of low cell 
density, YAP is nuclear and associates with enhancer regions and gene promoters. 
YAP is mainly described as a transcriptional activator of genes involved in cell 
proliferation and survival. Using a genome-wide approach, we show here that, in 
addition to its known function as a transcriptional activator, YAP functions as 
a transcriptional repressor by interacting with the multifunctional 
transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and Polycomb repressive complex member 
enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2). YAP colocalized with YY1 and EZH2 on the 
genome to transcriptionally repress a broad network of genes mediating a host of 
cellular functions, including repression of the cell-cycle kinase inhibitor p27, 
whose role is to functionally promote contact inhibition. This work unveils a 
broad and underappreciated aspect of YAP nuclear function as a transcriptional 
repressor and highlights how loss of contact inhibition in cancer is mediated in 
part through YAP repressive function.]]></TEXT>

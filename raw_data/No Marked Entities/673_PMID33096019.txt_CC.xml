<TEXT><![CDATA[Detecting Tumor Antigen-Specific T Cells via Interaction-Dependent 
Fucosyl-Biotinylation.

Re-activation and clonal expansion of tumor-specific antigen (TSA)-reactive 
T cells are critical to the success of checkpoint blockade and adoptive transfer 
of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-based therapies. There are no reliable 
markers to specifically identify the repertoire of TSA-reactive T cells due to 
their heterogeneous composition. We introduce FucoID as a general platform to 
detect endogenous antigen-specific T cells for studying their biology. Through 
this interaction-dependent labeling approach, intratumoral TSA-reactive CD4+, 
CD8+ T cells, and TSA-suppressive CD4+ T cells can be detected and separated 
from bystander T cells based on their cell-surface enzymatic 
fucosyl-biotinylation. Compared to bystander TILs, TSA-reactive TILs possess a 
distinct T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and unique gene features. Although 
exhibiting a dysfunctional phenotype, TSA-reactive CD8+ TILs possess substantial 
capabilities of proliferation and tumor-specific killing. Featuring genetic 
manipulation-free procedures and a quick turnover cycle, FucoID should have the 
potential of accelerating the pace of personalized cancer treatment.]]></TEXT>

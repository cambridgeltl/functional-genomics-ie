<TEXT><![CDATA[Genomic and Transcriptomic Profiling of Combined Hepatocellular and Intrahepatic 
Cholangiocarcinoma Reveals Distinct Molecular Subtypes.

We performed genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of 133 combined 
hepatocellular and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) cases, including 
separate, combined, and mixed subtypes. Integrative comparison of cHCC-ICC with 
hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma revealed that 
combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs are distinct subtypes with different clinical 
and molecular features. Integrating laser microdissection, cancer cell fraction 
analysis, and single nucleus sequencing, we revealed both mono- and multiclonal 
origins in the separate type cHCC-ICCs, whereas combined and mixed type 
cHCC-ICCs were all monoclonal origin. Notably, cHCC-ICCs showed significantly 
higher expression of Nestin, suggesting Nestin may serve as a biomarker for 
diagnosing cHCC-ICC. Our results provide important biological and clinical 
insights into cHCC-ICC.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Co-option of Neutrophil Fates by Tissue Environments.

Classically considered short-lived and purely defensive leukocytes, neutrophils 
are unique in their fast and moldable response to stimulation. This plastic 
behavior may underlie variable and even antagonistic functions during 
inflammation or cancer, yet the full spectrum of neutrophil properties as they 
enter healthy tissues remains unexplored. Using a new model to track neutrophil 
fates, we found short but variable lifetimes across multiple tissues. Through 
analysis of the receptor, transcriptional, and chromatin accessibility 
landscapes, we identify varying neutrophil states and assign non-canonical 
functions, including vascular repair and hematopoietic homeostasis. Accordingly, 
depletion of neutrophils compromised angiogenesis during early age, genotoxic 
injury, and viral infection, and impaired hematopoietic recovery after 
irradiation. Neutrophils acquired these properties in target tissues, a process 
that, in the lungs, occurred in CXCL12-rich areas and relied on CXCR4. Our 
results reveal that tissues co-opt neutrophils en route for elimination to 
induce programs that support their physiological demands.]]></TEXT>

Large scientific projects in genomics and astronomy are influential not because 
they answer any single question but because they enable investigation of 
continuously arising new questions from the same data-rich sources. Advances in 
automated mapping of the brain's synaptic connections (connectomics) suggest 
that the complicated circuits underlying brain function are ripe for analysis. 
We discuss benefits of mapping a mouse brain at the level of synapses.]]></TEXT>

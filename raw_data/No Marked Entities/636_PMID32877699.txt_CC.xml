COVID-19.

Humoral responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often of limited 
durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics. To address the 
underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in 
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a 
striking reduction in Bcl-6+ germinal center B cells but preservation of AID+ B 
cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in 
Bcl-6+ TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+ TH1 cells 
and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-Î± accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood 
studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease 
and accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific "disease-related" B cell populations. 
These data identify defective Bcl-6+ TFH cell generation and dysregulated 
humoral immune induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic 
explanation for the limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus 
infections, and suggest that achieving herd immunity through natural infection 
may be difficult.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Tau PTM Profiles Identify Patient Heterogeneity and Stages of Alzheimer's 
Disease.

To elucidate the role of Tau isoforms and post-translational modification (PTM) 
stoichiometry in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we generated a high-resolution 
quantitative proteomics map of 95 PTMs on multiple isoforms of Tau isolated from 
postmortem human tissue from 49 AD and 42 control subjects. Although Tau PTM 
maps reveal heterogeneity across subjects, a subset of PTMs display high 
occupancy and frequency for AD, suggesting importance in disease. Unsupervised 
analyses indicate that PTMs occur in an ordered manner, leading to Tau 
aggregation. The processive addition and minimal set of PTMs associated with 
seeding activity was further defined by analysis of size-fractionated Tau. To 
summarize, features in the Tau protein critical for disease intervention at 
different stages of disease are identified, including enrichment of 0N and 4R 
isoforms, underrepresentation of the C terminus, an increase in negative charge 
in the proline-rich region (PRR), and a decrease in positive charge in the 
microtubule binding domain (MBD).]]></TEXT>

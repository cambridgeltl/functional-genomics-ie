<TEXT><![CDATA[Patrolling Alveolar Macrophages Conceal Bacteria from the Immune System to 
Maintain Homeostasis.

During respiration, humans breathe in more than 10,000 liters of non-sterile air 
daily, allowing some pathogens access to alveoli. Interestingly, alveoli 
outnumber alveolar macrophages (AMs), which favors alveoli devoid of AMs. If 
AMs, like most tissue macrophages, are sessile, then this numerical advantage 
would be exploited by pathogens unless neutrophils from the blood stream 
intervened. However, this would translate to omnipresent persistent 
inflammation. Developing in vivo real-time intravital imaging of alveoli 
revealed AMs crawling in and between alveoli using the pores of Kohn. 
Importantly, these macrophages sensed, chemotaxed, and, with high efficiency, 
phagocytosed inhaled bacterial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, 
cloaking the bacteria from neutrophils. Impairing AM chemotaxis toward bacteria 
induced superfluous neutrophil recruitment, leading to inappropriate 
inflammation and injury. In a disease context, influenza A virus infection 
impaired AM crawling via the type II interferon signaling pathway, and this 
greatly increased secondary bacterial co-infection.]]></TEXT>

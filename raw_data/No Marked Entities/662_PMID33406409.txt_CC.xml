<TEXT><![CDATA[Spatiotemporal analysis of human intestinal development at single-cell 
resolution.

Development of the human intestine is not well understood. Here, we link 
single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize 
intestinal morphogenesis through time. We identify 101 cell states including 
epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor populations and programs linked to key 
morphogenetic milestones. We describe principles of crypt-villus axis formation; 
neural, vascular, mesenchymal morphogenesis, and immune population of the 
developing gut. We identify the differentiation hierarchies of developing 
fibroblast and myofibroblast subtypes and describe diverse functions for these 
including as vascular niche cells. We pinpoint the origins of Peyer's patches 
and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and describe location-specific immune 
programs. We use our resource to present an unbiased analysis of morphogen 
gradients that direct sequential waves of cellular differentiation and define 
cells and locations linked to rare developmental intestinal disorders. We 
compile a publicly available online resource, spatio-temporal analysis resource 
of fetal intestinal development (STAR-FINDer), to facilitate further work.]]></TEXT>

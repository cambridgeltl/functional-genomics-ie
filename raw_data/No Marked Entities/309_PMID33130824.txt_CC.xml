<TEXT><![CDATA[OPA1 and MICOS Regulate mitochondrial crista dynamics and formation.

Mitochondrial cristae are the main site for oxidative phosphorylation, which is 
critical for cellular energy production. Upon different physiological or 
pathological stresses, mitochondrial cristae undergo remodeling to reprogram 
mitochondrial function. However, how mitochondrial cristae are formed, 
maintained, and remolded is still largely unknown due to the technical 
challenges of tracking mitochondrial crista dynamics in living cells. Here, 
using live-cell Hessian structured illumination microscopy combined with 
transmission electron microscopy, focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy, 
and three-dimensional tomographic reconstruction, we show, in living cells, that 
mitochondrial cristae are highly dynamic and undergo morphological changes, 
including elongation, shortening, fusion, division, and detachment from the 
mitochondrial inner boundary membrane (IBM). In addition, we find that OPA1, 
Yme1L, MICOS, and Sam50, along with the newly identified crista regulator 
ATAD3A, control mitochondrial crista dynamics. Furthermore, we discover two new 
types of mitochondrial crista in dysfunctional mitochondria, "cut-through 
crista" and "spherical crista", which are formed due to incomplete mitochondrial 
fusion and dysfunction of the MICOS complex. Interestingly, cut-through crista 
can convert to "lamellar crista". Overall, we provide a direct link between 
mitochondrial crista formation and mitochondrial crista dynamics.]]></TEXT>

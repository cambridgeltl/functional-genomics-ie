factors overrides transcriptional control.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are regulated by a network of transcription factors 
that maintain the pluripotent state. Differentiation relies on down-regulation 
of pluripotency transcription factors disrupting this network. While 
investigating transcriptional regulation of the pluripotency transcription 
factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), we observed that homozygous deletion of 
distal enhancers caused a 17-fold decrease in Klf4 transcript but surprisingly 
decreased protein levels by less than twofold, indicating that 
posttranscriptional control of KLF4 protein overrides transcriptional control. 
The lack of sensitivity of KLF4 to transcription is due to high protein 
stability (half-life >24 h). This stability is context-dependent and is 
disrupted during differentiation, as evidenced by a shift to a half-life of <2 
h. KLF4 protein stability is maintained through interaction with other 
pluripotency transcription factors (NANOG, SOX2, and STAT3) that together 
facilitate association of KLF4 with RNA polymerase II. In addition, the KLF4 
DNA-binding and transactivation domains are required for optimal KLF4 protein 
stability. Posttranslational modification of KLF4 destabilizes the protein as 
cells exit the pluripotent state, and mutations that prevent this 
destabilization also prevent differentiation. These data indicate that the core 
pluripotency transcription factors are integrated by posttranslational 
mechanisms to maintain the pluripotent state and identify mutations that 
increase KLF4 protein stability while maintaining transcription factor function.

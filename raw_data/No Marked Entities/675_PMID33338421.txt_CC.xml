<TEXT><![CDATA[TMEM41B Is a Pan-flavivirus Host Factor.

Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are 
transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause 
outbreaks. To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection, we 
performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these 
results, we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and 
VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B 
revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require 
TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the 
Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide 
polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus 
infection. Based on our mechanistic studies, we propose that TMEM41B is 
recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane 
curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.]]></TEXT>

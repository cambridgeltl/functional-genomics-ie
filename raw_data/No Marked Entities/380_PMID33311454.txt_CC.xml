carcinoma by regulating miR-125b-2-3p/Slug.

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral cancer. The 
molecular mechanisms of this disease are not fully understood. Our previous 
studies confirmed that dysregulated function of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) 
AC007271.3 was associated with a poor prognosis and overexpression of AC007271.3 
promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis 
in vitro, and promoted tumor growth in vivo. However, the underlying mechanisms 
of AC007271.3 dysregulation remained obscure. In this study, our investigation 
showed that AC007271.3 functioned as competing endogenous RNA by binding to 
miR-125b-2-3p and by destabilizing primary miR-125b-2, resulted in the 
upregulating expression of Slug, which is a direct target of miR-125b-2-3p. Slug 
also inhibited the expression of E-cadherin but N-cadherin, vimentin, and 
β-catenin had no obvious change. The expression of AC007271.3 was promoted by 
the canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. Taken together, these results 
suggested that the classical NF-κB pathway-activated AC007271.3 regulates EMT by 
miR-125b-2-3p/Slug/E-cadherin axis to promote the development of OSCC, 
implicating it as a novel potential target for therapeutic intervention in this 
disease.]]></TEXT>

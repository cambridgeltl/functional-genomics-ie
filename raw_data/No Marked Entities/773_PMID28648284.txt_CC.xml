<TEXT><![CDATA[Common Molecular Subtypes Among Asian Hepatocellular Carcinoma and 
Cholangiocarcinoma.

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are 
clinically disparate primary liver cancers with etiological and biological 
heterogeneity. We identified common molecular subtypes linked to similar 
prognosis among 199 Thai ICC and HCC patients through systems integration of 
genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. While ICC and HCC share recurrently 
mutated genes, including TP53, ARID1A, and ARID2, mitotic checkpoint anomalies 
distinguish the C1 subtype with key drivers PLK1 and ECT2, whereas the C2 
subtype is linked to obesity, TÂ cell infiltration, and bile acid metabolism. 
These molecular subtypes are found in 582 Asian, but less so in 265 Caucasian 
patients. Thus, Asian ICC and HCC, while clinically treated as separate 
entities, share common molecular subtypes with similar actionable drivers to 
improve precision therapy.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Mapping Systemic Inflammation and Antibody Responses in Multisystem Inflammatory 
Syndrome in Children (MIS-C).

Initially, children were thought to be spared from disease caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a month into the 
epidemic, a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged. 
Herein, we report on the immune profiles of nine MIS-C cases. All MIS-C patients 
had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with 
intact neutralization capability. Cytokine profiling identified elevated 
signatures of inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis 
and activation (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1), and mucosal immune dysregulation 
(IL-17A, CCL20, and CCL28). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed 
reductions of non-classical monocytes, and subsets of NK and T lymphocytes, 
suggesting extravasation to affected tissues. Finally, profiling the autoantigen 
reactivity of MIS-C plasma revealed both known disease-associated autoantibodies 
(anti-La) and novel candidates that recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal, and 
immune-cell antigens. All patients were treated with anti-IL-6R antibody and/or 
IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution.]]></TEXT>

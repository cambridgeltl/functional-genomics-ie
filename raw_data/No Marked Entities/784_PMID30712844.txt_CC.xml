Suppression of Oxidative Phosphorylation.

The tumor suppressor p53 is somatically mutated in half of all human cancers. 
Paradoxically, the wild-type p53 (WTp53) is often retained in certain human 
cancers, such as hepatocarcinoma (HCC). We discovered a physiological and 
oncogenic role of WTp53 in suppressing pyruvate-driven oxidative phosphorylation 
by inducing PUMA. PUMA inhibits mitochondrial pyruvate uptake by disrupting the 
oligomerization and function of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) through 
PUMA-MPC interaction, which depends on IÎºB kinase-mediated phosphorylation of 
PUMA at Ser96/106. High expression levels of PUMA are correlated with decreased 
mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and increased glycolysis in HCCs and poor 
prognosis of HCC patients. These findings are instrumental for cancer drug 
discovery aiming at activating WTp53 or restoring WTp53 activity to p53 mutants.]]></TEXT>

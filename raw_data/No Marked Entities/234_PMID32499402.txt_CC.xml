stem cells.

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) ontogeny is accompanied by dynamic changes in gene 
regulatory networks. We performed RNA-seq and histone mark ChIP-seq to define 
the transcriptomes and epigenomes of cells representing key developmental stages 
of HSC ontogeny in mice. The five populations analyzed were embryonic day 10.5 
(E10.5) endothelium and hemogenic endothelium from the major arteries, an 
enriched population of prehematopoietic stem cells (pre-HSCs), fetal liver HSCs, 
and adult bone marrow HSCs. Using epigenetic signatures, we identified enhancers 
for each developmental stage. Only 12% of enhancers are primed, and 78% are 
active, suggesting the vast majority of enhancers are established de novo 
without prior priming in earlier stages. We constructed developmental 
stage-specific transcriptional regulatory networks by linking enhancers and 
predicted bound transcription factors to their target promoters using a novel 
computational algorithm, target inference via physical connection (TIPC). TIPC 
predicted known transcriptional regulators for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic 
transition, validating our overall approach, and identified putative novel 
transcription factors, including the broadly expressed transcription factors SP3 
and MAZ. Finally, we validated a role for SP3 and MAZ in the formation of 
hemogenic endothelium. Our data and computational analyses provide a useful 
resource for uncovering regulators of HSC formation.

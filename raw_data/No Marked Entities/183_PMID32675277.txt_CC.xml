Cancers.

Germline mutations in TP53 cause a rare high penetrance cancer syndrome, 
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). Here, we identified a rare TP53 tetramerization 
domain missense mutation, c.1000G>C;p.G334R, in a family with multiple 
late-onset LFS-spectrum cancers. Twenty additional c.1000G>C probands and one 
c.1000G>A proband were identified, and available tumors showed biallelic somatic 
inactivation of TP53. The majority of families were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, 
and the TP53 c.1000G>C allele was found on a commonly inherited chromosome 
17p13.1 haplotype. Transient transfection of the p.G334R allele conferred a mild 
defect in colony suppression assays. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from the index 
family in comparison with TP53 normal lines showed that although classical p53 
target gene activation was maintained, a subset of p53 target genes (including 
PCLO, PLTP, PLXNB3, and LCN15) showed defective transactivation when treated 
with Nutlin-3a. Structural analysis demonstrated thermal instability of the 
G334R-mutant tetramer, and the G334R-mutant protein showed increased 
preponderance of mutant conformation. Clinical case review in comparison with 
classic LFS cohorts demonstrated similar rates of pediatric adrenocortical 
tumors and other LFS component cancers, but the latter at significantly later 
ages of onset. Our data show that TP53 c.1000G>C;p.G334R is found predominantly 
in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, causes a mild defect in p53 function, and leads 
to low penetrance LFS.]]></TEXT>

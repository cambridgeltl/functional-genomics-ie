The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout 
the world. Clinical features that drive SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in humans 
include inflammation and thrombosis, but the mechanistic details underlying 
these processes remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate 
endothelial disruption and vascular thrombosis in histopathologic sections of 
lungs from both humans and rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. To define 
key molecular pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in macaques, we 
performed transcriptomic analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood 
and proteomic analyses of serum. We observed macrophage infiltrates in lung and 
upregulation of macrophage, complement, platelet activation, thrombosis, and 
proinflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, MX1, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, 
TNFα, and NF-κB. These results suggest a model in which critical interactions 
between inflammatory and thrombosis pathways lead to SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular 
disease. Our findings suggest potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19.]]></TEXT>

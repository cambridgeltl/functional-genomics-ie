carcinoma.


Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has high relapse and low 5-year survival rates. 
Single-cell profiling in relapsed HCC may aid in the design of effective 
anticancer therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes 
of ∼17,000 cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse 
tumors have reduced levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells 
(DCs), and increased infiltrated CD8+ T cells, compared with primary tumors, in 
two independent cohorts. Remarkably, CD8+ T cells in recurrent tumors 
overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state, 
with low clonal expansion, unlike the classical exhausted state observed in 
primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells was associated with a worse 
prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction analyses revealed 
potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that dampen DC 
antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8+ T cells. Our comprehensive 
picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune evasion 
mechanisms associated with tumor relapse.]]></TEXT>

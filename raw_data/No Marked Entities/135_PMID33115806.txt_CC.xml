Epithelial Cancers.

Activation of transcription factors is a key driver event in cancer. We and 
others have recently reported that the KrÃ¼ppel-like transcription factor KLF5 is 
activated in multiple epithelial cancer types including squamous cancer and 
gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma, yet the functional consequences and the 
underlying mechanisms of this activation remain largely unknown. Here we 
demonstrate that activation of KLF5 results in strongly selective KLF5 
dependency for these cancer types. KLF5 bound lineage-specific regulatory 
elements and activated gene expression programs essential to cancer cells. 
HiChIP analysis revealed that multiple distal KLF5 binding events cluster and 
synergize to activate individual target genes. Immunoprecipitation-mass 
spectrometry assays showed that KLF5 interacts with other transcription factors 
such as TP63 and YAP1, as well as the CBP/EP300 acetyltransferase complex. 
Furthermore, KLF5 guided the CBP/EP300 complex to increase acetylation of H3K27, 
which in turn enhanced recruitment of the bromodomain protein BRD4 to chromatin. 
The 3D chromatin architecture aggregated KLF5-dependent BRD4 binding to activate 
polymerase II elongation at KLF5 target genes, which conferred a transcriptional 
vulnerability to proteolysis-targeting chimera-induced degradation of BRD4. Our 
study demonstrates that KLF5 plays an essential role in multiple epithelial 
cancers by activating cancer-related genes through 3D chromatin loops, providing 
an evidence-based rationale for targeting the KLF5 pathway. SIGNIFICANCE: An 
integrative 3D genomics methodology delineates mechanisms underlying the 
function of KLF5 in multiple epithelial cancers and suggests potential 
strategies to target cancers with aberrantly activated KLF5.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Early Emergence of Liver Parenchymal and 
Non-parenchymal Cell Lineages.

The cellular complexity and scale of the early liver have constrained analyses 
examining its emergence during organogenesis. To circumvent these issues, we 
analyzed 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes from embryonic day (E)7.5, when 
endoderm progenitors are specified, to E10.5 liver, when liver parenchymal and 
non-parenchymal cell lineages emerge. Our data detail divergence of vascular and 
sinusoidal endothelia, including a distinct transcriptional profile for 
sinusoidal endothelial specification by E8.75. We characterize two distinct 
mesothelial cell types as well as early hepatic stellate cells and reveal 
distinct spatiotemporal distributions for these populations. We capture 
transcriptional profiles for hepatoblast specification and migration, including 
the emergence of a hepatomesenchymal cell type and evidence for hepatoblast 
collective cell migration. Further, we identify cell-cell interactions during 
the organization of the primitive sinusoid. This study provides a comprehensive 
atlas of liver lineage establishment from the endoderm and mesoderm through to 
the organization of the primitive sinusoid at single-cell resolution.]]></TEXT>

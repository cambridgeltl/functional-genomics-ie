Off-Tumor Targets for CAR-T Immunotherapies.

CD19-directed immunotherapies are clinically effective for treating B cell 
malignancies but also cause a high incidence of neurotoxicity. A subset of 
patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or bispecific 
T cell engager (BiTE) antibodies display severe neurotoxicity, including fatal 
cerebral edema associated with T cell infiltration into the brain. Here, we 
report that mural cells, which surround the endothelium and are critical for 
blood-brain-barrier integrity, express CD19. We identify CD19 expression in 
brain mural cells using single-cell RNA sequencing data and confirm perivascular 
staining at the protein level. CD19 expression in the brain begins early in 
development alongside the emergence of mural cell lineages and persists 
throughout adulthood across brain regions. Mouse mural cells demonstrate lower 
levels of Cd19 expression, suggesting limitations in preclinical animal models 
of neurotoxicity. These data suggest an on-target mechanism for neurotoxicity in 
CD19-directed therapies and highlight the utility of human single-cell atlases 
for designing immunotherapies.]]></TEXT>

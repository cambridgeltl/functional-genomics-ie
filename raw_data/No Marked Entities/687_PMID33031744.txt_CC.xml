Laboratory Mice.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused extreme human suffering and economic harm. We 
generated and characterized a new mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus that captures 
multiple aspects of severe COVID-19 disease in standard laboratory mice. This 
SARS-CoV-2 model exhibits the spectrum of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 
disease as well as aspects of host genetics, age, cellular tropisms, elevated 
Th1 cytokines, and loss of surfactant expression and pulmonary function linked 
to pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS). This model can rapidly access existing mouse resources 
to elucidate the role of host genetics, underlying molecular mechanisms 
governing SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, and the protective or pathogenic immune 
responses related to disease severity. The model promises to provide a robust 
platform for studies of ALI and ARDS to evaluate vaccine and antiviral drug 
performance, including in the most vulnerable populations (i.e., the aged) using 
standard laboratory mice.]]></TEXT>

death modes including pyroptosis.

Lipid peroxidation (LPO) drives ferroptosis execution. However, LPO has been 
shown to contribute also to other modes of regulated cell death (RCD). To 
clarify the role of LPO in different modes of RCD, we studied in a comprehensive 
approach the differential involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
phospholipid peroxidation products, and lipid ROS flux in the major prototype 
modes of RCD viz. apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and pyroptosis. LC-MS 
oxidative lipidomics revealed robust peroxidation of three classes of 
phospholipids during ferroptosis with quantitative predominance of 
phosphatidylethanolamine species. Incomparably lower amounts of phospholipid 
peroxidation products were found in any of the other modes of RCD. Nonetheless, 
a strong increase in lipid ROS levels was detected in non-canonical pyroptosis, 
but only during cell membrane rupture. In contrast to ferroptosis, lipid ROS 
apparently was not involved in non-canonical pyroptosis execution nor in the 
release of IL-1Î² and IL-18, while clear dependency on CASP11 and GSDMD was 
observed. Our data demonstrate that ferroptosis is the only mode of RCD that 
depends on excessive phospholipid peroxidation for its cytotoxicity. In 
addition, our results also highlight the importance of performing kinetics and 
using different methods to monitor the occurrence of LPO. This should open the 
discussion on the implication of particular LPO events in relation to different 
modes of RCD.]]></TEXT>

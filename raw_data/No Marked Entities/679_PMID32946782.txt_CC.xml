<TEXT><![CDATA[Structure of a Hallucinogen-Activated Gq-Coupled 5-HT(2A) Serotonin Receptor.

Hallucinogens like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and substituted 
N-benzyl phenylalkylamines are widely used recreationally with psilocybin being 
considered as a therapeutic for many neuropsychiatric disorders including 
depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. How psychedelics mediate their 
actions-both therapeutic and hallucinogenic-are not understood, although 
activation of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular 
insights into psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure of 
HTR2A bound to 25-CN-NBOH-a prototypical hallucinogen-in complex with an 
engineered Gαq heterotrimer by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We also 
obtained the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with the 
arrestin-biased ligand LSD or the inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of 
these structures reveal determinants responsible for HTR2A-Gαq protein 
interactions as well as the conformational rearrangements involved in 
active-state transitions. Given the potential therapeutic actions of 
hallucinogens, these findings could accelerate the discovery of more selective 
drugs for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.]]></TEXT>

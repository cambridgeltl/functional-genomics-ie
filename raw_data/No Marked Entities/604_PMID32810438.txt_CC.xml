Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild to moderate respiratory tract 
infection, however, a subset of patients progress to severe disease and 
respiratory failure. The mechanism of protective immunity in mild forms and the 
pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 associated with increased neutrophil counts and 
dysregulated immune responses remain unclear. In a dual-center, two-cohort 
study, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of 
whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to determine changes in 
immune cell composition and activation in mild versus severe COVID-19 (242 
samples from 109 individuals) over time. HLA-DRhiCD11chi inflammatory monocytes 
with an interferon-stimulated gene signature were elevated in mild COVID-19. 
Severe COVID-19 was marked by occurrence of neutrophil precursors, as evidence 
of emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DRlo 
monocytes. Our study provides detailed insights into the systemic immune 
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals profound alterations in the myeloid 
cell compartment associated with severe COVID-19.]]></TEXT>

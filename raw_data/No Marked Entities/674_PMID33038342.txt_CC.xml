<TEXT><![CDATA[Key Parameters of Tumor Epitope Immunogenicity Revealed Through a Consortium 
Approach Improve Neoantigen Prediction.

Many approaches to identify therapeutically relevant neoantigens couple tumor 
sequencing with bioinformatic algorithms and inferred rules of tumor epitope 
immunogenicity. However, there are no reference data to compare these 
approaches, and the parameters governing tumor epitope immunogenicity remain 
unclear. Here, we assembled a global consortium wherein each participant 
predicted immunogenic epitopes from shared tumor sequencing data. 608 epitopes 
were subsequently assessed for T cell binding in patient-matched samples. By 
integrating peptide features associated with presentation and recognition, we 
developed a model of tumor epitope immunogenicity that filtered out 98% of 
non-immunogenic peptides with a precision above 0.70. Pipelines prioritizing 
model features had superior performance, and pipeline alterations leveraging 
them improved prediction performance. These findings were validated in an 
independent cohort of 310 epitopes prioritized from tumor sequencing data and 
assessed for T cell binding. This data resource enables identification of 
parameters underlying effective anti-tumor immunity and is available to the 
research community.]]></TEXT>

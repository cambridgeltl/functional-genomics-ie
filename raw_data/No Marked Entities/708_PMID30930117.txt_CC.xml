<TEXT><![CDATA[Human Tumor-Associated Macrophage and Monocyte Transcriptional Landscapes Reveal 
Cancer-Specific Reprogramming, Biomarkers, and Therapeutic Targets.

The roles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and circulating monocytes in 
human cancer are poorly understood. Here, we show that monocyte subpopulation 
distribution and transcriptomes are significantly altered by the presence of 
endometrial and breast cancer. Furthermore, TAMs from endometrial and breast 
cancers are transcriptionally distinct from monocytes and their respective 
tissue-resident macrophages. We identified a breast TAM signature that is highly 
enriched in aggressive breast cancer subtypes and associated with shorter 
disease-specific survival. We also identified an auto-regulatory loop between 
TAMs and cancer cells driven by tumor necrosis factor alpha involving SIGLEC1 
and CCL8, which is self-reinforcing through the production of CSF1. Together 
these data provide direct evidence that monocyte and macrophage transcriptional 
landscapes are perturbed by cancer, reflecting patient outcomes.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Sex differences in autophagy-mediated diseases: toward precision medicine.

Nearly all diseases in humans, to a certain extent, exhibit sex differences, 
including differences in the onset, progression, prevention, therapy, and 
prognosis of diseases. Accumulating evidence shows that 
macroautophagy/autophagy, as a mechanism for development, differentiation, 
survival, and homeostasis, is involved in numerous aspects of sex differences in 
diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. 
Advances in our knowledge regarding sex differences in autophagy-mediated 
diseases have enabled an understanding of their roles in human diseases, 
although the underlying molecular mechanisms of sex differences in autophagy 
remain largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss current advances in our 
insight into the biology of sex differences in autophagy and disease, 
information that will facilitate precision medicine.]]></TEXT>

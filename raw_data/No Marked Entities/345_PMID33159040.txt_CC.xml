<TEXT><![CDATA[Age-severity matched cytokine profiling reveals specific signatures in Covid-19 
patients.

A global effort is currently undertaken to restrain the COVID-19 pandemic. Host 
immunity has come out as a determinant for COVID-19 clinical outcomes, and 
several studies investigated the immune profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected people 
to properly direct the clinical management of the disease. Thus, lymphopenia, 
T-cell exhaustion, and the increased levels of inflammatory mediators have been 
described in COVID-19 patients, in particular in severe cases1. Age represents a 
key factor in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality2. Understanding age-associated 
immune signatures of patients are therefore important to identify preventive and 
therapeutic strategies. In this study, we investigated the immune profile of 
COVID-19 hospitalized patients identifying a distinctive age-dependent immune 
signature associated with disease severity. Indeed, defined circulating factors 
- CXCL8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-27, and TNF-Î± - positively correlate with older age, 
longer hospitalization, and a more severe form of the disease and may thus 
represent the leading signature in critical COVID-19 patients.]]></TEXT>

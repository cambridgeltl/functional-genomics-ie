<TEXT><![CDATA[Hybrid Epithelial-Mesenchymal Phenotypes Are Controlled by Microenvironmental 
Factors.

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been associated with cancer cell 
heterogeneity, plasticity, and metastasis. However, the extrinsic signals 
supervising these phenotypic transitions remain elusive. To assess how selected 
microenvironmental signals control cancer-associated phenotypes along the EMT 
continuum, we defined a logical model of the EMT cellular network that yields 
qualitative degrees of cell adhesions by adherens junctions and focal adhesions, 
two features affected during EMT. The model attractors recovered epithelial, 
mesenchymal, and hybrid phenotypes. Simulations showed that hybrid phenotypes 
may arise through independent molecular paths involving stringent extrinsic 
signals. Of particular interest, model predictions and their experimental 
validations indicated that: (i) stiffening of the extracellular matrix was a 
prerequisite for cells overactivating FAK_SRC to upregulate SNAIL and acquire a 
mesenchymal phenotype and (ii) FAK_SRC inhibition of cell-cell contacts through 
the receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatases kappa led to acquisition of a 
full mesenchymal, rather than a hybrid, phenotype. Altogether, these 
computational and experimental approaches allow assessment of critical 
microenvironmental signals controlling hybrid EMT phenotypes and indicate that 
EMT involves multiple molecular programs.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Cytokine Storms in Cancer and COVID-19.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, research on "cytokine storms" has been 
reinvigorated in the field of infectious disease, but it also has particular 
relevance to cancer research. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has emerged as a key 
component of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, such that the repurposing of 
anti-IL-6 therapeutics for COVID-19 is now a major line of investigation, with 
several ongoing clinical trials. We lay a framework for understanding the role 
of IL-6 in the context of cancer research and COVID-19 and suggest how lessons 
learned from cancer research may impact SARS-CoV-2 research and vice versa.

<TEXT><![CDATA[Longitudinal Multi-omics Reveals Subset-Specific Mechanisms Underlying Irritable 
Bowel Syndrome.

The gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple human chronic 
gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Determining its mechanistic role in disease has 
been difficult due to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and 
lack of an integrated multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological 
changes. We integrated longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, 
metabolome, host epigenome, and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel 
syndrome (IBS) host physiology. We identified IBS subtype-specific and 
symptom-related variation in microbial composition and function. A subset of 
identified changes in microbial metabolites correspond to host physiological 
mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating multiple data layers, we 
identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial metabolic pathway in IBS 
with translational potential. Our study highlights the importance of 
longitudinal sampling and integrating complementary multi-omics data to identify 
functional mechanisms that can serve as therapeutic targets in a comprehensive 
treatment strategy for chronic GI diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.]]></TEXT>

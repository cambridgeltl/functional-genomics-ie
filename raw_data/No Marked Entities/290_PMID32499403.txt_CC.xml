interactions during postmitotic transcriptional reactivation.

During mitosis, transcription of genomic DNA is dramatically reduced, before it 
is reactivated during nuclear reformation in anaphase/telophase. Many aspects of 
the underlying principles that mediate transcriptional memory and reactivation 
in the daughter cells remain unclear. Here, we used ChIP-seq on synchronized 
cells at different stages after mitosis to generate genome-wide maps of histone 
modifications. Combined with EU-RNA-seq and Hi-C analyses, we found that during 
prometaphase, promoters, enhancers, and insulators retain H3K4me3 and H3K4me1, 
while losing H3K27ac. Enhancers globally retaining mitotic H3K4me1 or locally 
retaining mitotic H3K27ac are associated with cell type-specific genes and their 
transcription factors for rapid transcriptional activation. As cells exit 
mitosis, promoters regain H3K27ac, which correlates with transcriptional 
reactivation. Insulators also gain H3K27ac and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in 
anaphase/telophase. This increase of H3K27ac in anaphase/telophase is required 
for posttranscriptional activation and may play a role in the establishment of 
topologically associating domains (TADs). Together, our results suggest that the 
genome is reorganized in a sequential order, in which histone methylations occur 
first in prometaphase, histone acetylation, and CTCF in anaphase/telophase, 
transcription in cytokinesis, and long-range chromatin interactions in early G1. 
We thus provide insights into the histone modification landscape that allows 
faithful reestablishment of the transcriptional program and TADs during cell 
division.]]></TEXT>

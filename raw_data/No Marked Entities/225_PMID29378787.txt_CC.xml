Regulation by gene-distal enhancers is critical for cell type-specific and 
condition-specific patterns of gene expression. Thus, to understand the basis of 
gene activity in a given cell type or tissue, we must identify the precise 
locations of enhancers and functionally characterize their behaviors. Here, we 
demonstrate that transcription is a nearly universal feature of enhancers in 
Drosophila and mammalian cells and that nascent RNA sequencing strategies are 
optimal for identification of both enhancers and superenhancers. We dissect the 
mechanisms governing enhancer transcription and discover remarkable similarities 
to transcription at protein-coding genes. We show that RNA polymerase II 
(RNAPII) undergoes regulated pausing and release at enhancers. However, as 
compared with mRNA genes, RNAPII at enhancers is less stable and more prone to 
early termination. Furthermore, we found that the level of histone H3 Lys4 
(H3K4) methylation at enhancers corresponds to transcriptional activity such 
that highly active enhancers display H3K4 trimethylation rather than the H3K4 
monomethylation considered a hallmark of enhancers. Finally, our work provides 
insights into the unique characteristics of superenhancers, which stimulate 
high-level gene expression through rapid pause release; interestingly, this 
property renders associated genes resistant to the loss of factors that 
stabilize paused RNAPII.

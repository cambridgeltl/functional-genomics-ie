<TEXT><![CDATA[The spatial regulation of condensin activity in chromosome condensation.

Condensin mediates chromosome condensation, which is essential for proper 
chromosome segregation during mitosis. Prior to anaphase of budding yeast, the 
ribosomal DNA (RDN) condenses to a thin loop that is distinct from the rest of 
the chromosomes. We provide evidence that the establishment and maintenance of 
this RDN condensation requires the regulation of condensin by Cdc5p (polo) 
kinase. We show that Cdc5p is recruited to the site of condensin binding in the 
RDN by cohesin, a complex related to condensin. Cdc5p and cohesin prevent 
condensin from misfolding the RDN into an irreversibly decondensed state. From 
these and other observations, we propose that the spatial regulation of Cdc5p by 
cohesin modulates condensin activity to ensure proper RDN folding into a thin 
loop. This mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved, promoting the thinly 
condensed constrictions that occur at centromeres and RDN of mitotic chromosomes 
in plants and animals.]]></TEXT>

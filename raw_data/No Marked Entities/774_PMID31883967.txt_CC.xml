<TEXT><![CDATA[Pangenomic Classification of Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumors.

Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are common, with five main 
histological subtypes: lactotroph, somatotroph, and thyrotroph (POU1F1/PIT1 
lineage); corticotroph (TBX19/TPIT lineage); and gonadotroph (NR5A1/SF1 
lineage). We report a comprehensive pangenomic classification of PitNETs. 
PitNETs from POU1F1/PIT1 lineage showed an epigenetic signature of diffuse DNA 
hypomethylation, with transposable elementsÂ expression and chromosomal 
instability (except for GNAS-mutated somatotrophs). In TPIT lineage, 
corticotrophs were divided into three classes: the USP8-mutated with overt 
secretion, the USP8-wild-type with increased invasiveness and increased 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the large silent tumors with gonadotroph 
transdifferentiation. Unexpected expression of gonadotroph markers was also 
found in GNAS-wild-type somatotrophs (SF1 expression), challenging the current 
definition of SF1/gonadotroph lineage. This classification improves our 
understanding and affects the clinical stratification of patients with PitNETs.]]></TEXT>

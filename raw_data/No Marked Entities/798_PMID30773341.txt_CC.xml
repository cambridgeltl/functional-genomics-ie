Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (PCa) benefits patients with 
early disease, but becomes ineffective as PCa progresses to a 
castration-resistant state (CRPC). Initially CRPC remains dependent on androgen 
receptor (AR) signaling, often through increased expression of full-length AR 
(ARfl) or expression of dominantly active splice variants such as ARv7. We show 
in ARv7-dependent CRPC models that ARv7 binds together with ARfl to repress 
transcription of a set of growth-suppressive genes. Expression of the 
ARv7-repressed targets and ARv7 protein expression are negatively correlated and 
predicts for outcome in PCa patients. Our results provide insights into the role 
of ARv7 in CRPC and define a set of potential biomarkers for tumors dependent on 
ARv7.

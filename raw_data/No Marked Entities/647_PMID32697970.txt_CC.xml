Unclear.

In this issue of Cell, Korber et al. found that a SARS-CoV-2 variant in the 
spike protein D614G rapidly became dominant around the world. Although clinical 
and in vitro data suggest that D614G changes the virus phenotype, the impact of 
the mutation on transmission, disease, and vaccine and therapeutic development 
are largely unknown.]]></TEXT>

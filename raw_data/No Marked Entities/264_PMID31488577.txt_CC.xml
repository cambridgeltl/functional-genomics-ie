pediatric glioma.

The histone methyltransferase activity of PRC2 is central to the formation of 
H3K27me3-decorated facultative heterochromatin and gene silencing. In addition, 
PRC2 has been shown to automethylate its core subunits, EZH1/EZH2 and SUZ12. 
Here, we identify the lysine residues at which EZH1/EZH2 are automethylated with 
EZH2-K510 and EZH2-K514 being the major such sites in vivo. Automethylated 
EZH2/PRC2 exhibits a higher level of histone methyltransferase activity and is 
required for attaining proper cellular levels of H3K27me3. While occurring 
independently of PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, automethylation promotes PRC2 
accessibility to the histone H3 tail. Intriguingly, EZH2 automethylation is 
significantly reduced in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells that 
carry a lysine-to-methionine substitution in histone H3 (H3K27M), but not in 
cells that carry either EZH2 or EED mutants that abrogate PRC2 allosteric 
activation, indicating that H3K27M impairs the intrinsic activity of PRC2. Our 
study demonstrates a PRC2 self-regulatory mechanism through its EZH1/2-mediated 
automethylation activity.]]></TEXT>

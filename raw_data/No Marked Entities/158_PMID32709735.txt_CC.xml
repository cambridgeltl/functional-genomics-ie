Prospective Analyses in UK Biobank.

Circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is positively associated with 
the risks of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, but evidence for other 
less common cancers is limited. In this study, we investigated associations 
between serum IGF-I concentrations and incidence of less common cancers in the 
UK Biobank study. To enable comparison of effect estimates, and as positive 
controls, both common and less common cancer sites (total 30) were included in 
an outcome-wide analysis. Data from 394,388 cancer-free participants in the UK 
Biobank study were analyzed. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards 
models were used to determine associations between baseline serum IGF-I 
concentrations and cancer incidence, using repeated IGF-I measurements from up 
to 14,149 participants to correct for regression dilution bias. Higher IGF-I 
concentration was associated with increased risks of thyroid cancer [HR per 5 
nmol/L higher concentration 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.37] in 
addition to colorectal (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13), breast (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 
1.07-1.15), and prostate cancer (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12), and reduced risks 
of ovarian and liver cancer. Mean follow-up was 6.9 years and the possibility 
that the observed associations may be influenced by reverse causality bias 
cannot be excluded. Additional nominally significant associations with malignant 
melanoma, multiple myeloma, oral cancer, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 
did not survive correction for multiple testing. Studies with longer follow-up 
and pooled analyses are needed to further assess how broad the role of IGF-I is 
in cancer development.]]></TEXT>

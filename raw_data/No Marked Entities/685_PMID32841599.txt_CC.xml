<TEXT><![CDATA[Deep Mutational Scanning of SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain Reveals 
Constraints on Folding and ACE2 Binding.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates 
viral attachment to ACE2 receptor and is a major determinant of host range and a 
dominant target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we experimentally measure how 
all amino acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein and its 
affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 
binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBD's surface that may be 
desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics. But a 
substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding, 
including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related 
coronaviruses. However, we find no evidence that these ACE2-affinity-enhancing 
mutations have been selected in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic isolates. We present 
an interactive visualization and open analysis pipeline to facilitate use of our 
dataset for vaccine design and functional annotation of mutations observed 
during viral surveillance.]]></TEXT>

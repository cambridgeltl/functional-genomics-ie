<TEXT><![CDATA[Compromised Humoral Functional Evolution Tracks with SARS-CoV-2 Mortality.

The urgent need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has forced development to 
progress in the absence of well-defined correlates of immunity. While 
neutralization has been linked to protection against other pathogens, whether 
neutralization alone will be sufficient to drive protection against SARS-CoV-2 
in the broader population remains unclear. Therefore, to fully define protective 
humoral immunity, we dissected the early evolution of the humoral response in 
193 hospitalized individuals ranging from moderate to severe. Although robust 
IgM and IgA responses evolved in both survivors and non-survivors with severe 
disease, non-survivors showed attenuated IgG responses, accompanied by 
compromised FcÉ£ receptor binding and Fc effector activity, pointing to deficient 
humoral development rather than disease-enhancing humoral immunity. In contrast, 
individuals with moderate disease exhibited delayed responses that ultimately 
matured. These data highlight distinct humoral trajectories associated with 
resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need for early functional humoral 
immunity.]]></TEXT>

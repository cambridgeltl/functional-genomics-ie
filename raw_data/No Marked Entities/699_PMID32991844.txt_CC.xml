Receptor-Binding Domain by Structure-Guided High-Resolution Serology.

Analysis of the specificity and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) 
elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for understanding immune protection 
and identifying targets for vaccine design. In a cohort of 647 
SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses 
to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical 
scores. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 
90% of the neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas 
overall RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49Â days, nAb 
titers and avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with 
affinity maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and 
serologically quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to 
the identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our 
results explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide 
the design of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.]]></TEXT>

COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term 
immune protection against COVID-19. Here, we systematically mapped the 
functional and phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in 
unexposed individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or 
convalescent COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a 
highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical 
markers of disease severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific 
T cells were polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. 
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in 
antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent individuals with a 
history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset shows that 
SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory T cell 
responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent 
episodes of severe COVID-19.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Genomic and Transcriptomic Landscape of Triple-Negative Breast Cancers: Subtypes 
and Treatment Strategies.

We comprehensively analyzed clinical, genomic, and transcriptomic data of a 
cohort of 465 primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). PIK3CA mutations and 
copy-number gains of chromosome 22q11 were more frequent in our Chinese cohort 
than in The Cancer Genome Atlas. We classified TNBCs into four 
transcriptome-based subtypes: (1) luminal androgen receptor (LAR), (2) 
immunomodulatory, (3) basal-like immune-suppressed, and (4) mesenchymal-like. 
Putative therapeutic targets or biomarkers were identified among each subtype. 
Importantly, the LAR subtype showed more ERBB2 somatic mutations, infrequent 
mutational signature 3 and frequent CDKN2A loss. The comprehensive profile of 
TNBCs provided here will serve as a reference to further advance the 
understanding and precision treatment of TNBC.]]></TEXT>

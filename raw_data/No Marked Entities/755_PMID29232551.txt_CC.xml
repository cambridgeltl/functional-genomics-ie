It has long been hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are responsible 
for the association between chronic inflammatory diseases and increased tumor 
incidence. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Canli etÂ al. now demonstrate that 
amplified ROS production specifically by myeloid cells is sufficient to promote 
intestinal mutagenesis.]]></TEXT>

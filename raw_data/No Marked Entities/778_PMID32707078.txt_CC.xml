Adenocarcinoma.

Regulatory networks that maintain functional, differentiated cell states are 
often dysregulated in tumor development. Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to 
profile chromatin state transitions in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma 
(LUAD). We identify an epigenomic continuum representing loss of cellular 
identity and progression toward a metastatic state. We define co-accessible 
regulatory programs and infer key activating and repressive chromatin regulators 
of these cell states. Among these co-accessibility programs, we identify a 
pre-metastatic transition, characterized by activation of RUNX transcription 
factors, which mediates extracellular matrix remodeling to promote metastasis 
and is predictive of survival across human LUAD patients. Together, these 
results demonstrate the power of single-cell epigenomics to identify regulatory 
programs to uncover mechanisms and key biomarkers of tumor progression.]]></TEXT>

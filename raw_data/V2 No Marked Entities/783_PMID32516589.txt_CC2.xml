<TEXT><![CDATA[Visualizing Synaptic Transfer of Tumor Antigens among Dendritic Cells.

Generation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes begins when tumor antigens reach 
the lymph node (LN) to stimulate T cells, yet we know little of how tumor 
material is disseminated among the large variety of antigen-presenting dendritic 
cell (DC) subsets in the LN. Here, we demonstrate that tumor proteins are 
carried to the LN within discrete vesicles inside DCs and are then transferred 
among DC subsets. A synapse is formed between interacting DCs and vesicle 
transfer takes place in the absence of free exosomes. DCs -containing vesicles 
can uniquely activate T cells, whereas DCs lacking them do not. Understanding 
this restricted sharing of tumor identity provides substantial room for 
engineering better anti-tumor immunity.

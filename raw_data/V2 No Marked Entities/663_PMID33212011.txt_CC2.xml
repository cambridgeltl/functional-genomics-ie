Interferon (IFN)-Is are crucial mediators of antiviral immunity and homeostatic 
immune system regulation. However, the source of IFN-I signaling under 
homeostatic conditions is unclear. We discovered that commensal microbes 
regulate the IFN-I response through induction of IFN-β by colonic DCs. Moreover, 
the mechanism by which a specific commensal microbe induces IFN-β was 
identified. Outer membrane (OM)-associated glycolipids of gut commensal microbes 
belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum induce expression of IFN-β. Using 
Bacteroides fragilis and its OM-associated polysaccharide A, we determined that 
IFN-β expression was induced via TLR4-TRIF signaling. Antiviral activity of this 
purified microbial molecule against infection with either vesicular stomatitis 
virus (VSV) or influenza was demonstrated to be dependent on the induction of 
IFN-β. In a murine VSV infection model, commensal-induced IFN-β regulated 
natural resistance to virus infection. Due to the physiological importance of 
IFN-Is, discovery of an IFN-β-inducing microbial molecule represents a potential 
approach for the treatment of some human diseases.]]></TEXT>

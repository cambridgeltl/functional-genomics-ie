<TEXT><![CDATA[Elevated Calprotectin and Abnormal Myeloid Cell Subsets Discriminate Severe from 
Mild COVID-19.

Blood myeloid cells are known to be dysregulated in coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is unknown whether the innate myeloid 
response differs with disease severity and whether markers of innate immunity 
discriminate high-risk patients. Thus, we performed high-dimensional flow 
cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient peripheral blood 
cells and detected disappearance of non-classical CD14LowCD16High monocytes, 
accumulation of HLA-DRLow classical monocytes (Human Leukocyte Antigen 
- DR isotype), and release of massive amounts of calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) in 
severe cases. Immature CD10LowCD101-CXCR4+/- neutrophils with an 
immunosuppressive profile accumulated in the blood and lungs, suggesting 
emergency myelopoiesis. Finally, we show that calprotectin plasma level and a 
routine flow cytometry assay detecting decreased frequencies of non-classical 
monocytes could discriminate patients who develop a severe form of COVID-19, 
suggesting a predictive value that deserves prospective evaluation.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[IL4I1 Is a Metabolic Immune Checkpoint that Activates the AHR and Promotes Tumor 
Progression.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation by tryptophan (Trp) catabolites 
enhances tumor malignancy and suppresses anti-tumor immunity. The context 
specificity of AHR target genes has so far impeded systematic investigation of 
AHR activity and its upstream enzymes across human cancers. A pan-tissue AHR 
signature, derived by natural language processing, revealed that across 32 tumor 
entities, interleukin-4-induced-1 (IL4I1) associates more frequently with AHR 
activity than IDO1 or TDO2, hitherto recognized as the main Trp-catabolic 
enzymes. IL4I1 activates the AHR through the generation of indole metabolites 
and kynurenic acid. It associates with reduced survival in glioma patients, 
promotes cancer cell motility, and suppresses adaptive immunity, thereby 
enhancing the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in mice. Immune 
checkpoint blockade (ICB) induces IDO1 and IL4I1. As IDO1 inhibitors do not 
block IL4I1, IL4I1 may explain the failure of clinical studies combining ICB 
with IDO1 inhibition. Taken together, IL4I1 blockade opens new avenues for 
cancer therapy.]]></TEXT>

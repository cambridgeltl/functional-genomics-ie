Reprogramming Neuroendocrine Fate.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine tumor treated clinically as a 
single disease with poor outcomes. Distinct SCLC molecular subtypes have been 
defined based on expression of ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, or YAP1. Here, we use 
mouse and human models with a time-series single-cell transcriptome analysis to 
reveal that MYC drives dynamic evolution of SCLC subtypes. In neuroendocrine 
cells, MYC activates Notch to dedifferentiate tumor cells, promoting a temporal 
shift in SCLC from ASCL1+ to NEUROD1+ to YAP1+ states. MYC alternatively 
promotes POU2F3+ tumors from a distinct cell type. Human SCLC exhibits 
intratumoral subtype heterogeneity, suggesting that this dynamic evolution 
occurs in patient tumors. These findings suggest that genetics, cell of origin, 
and tumor cell plasticity determine SCLC subtype.

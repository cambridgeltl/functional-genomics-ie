<TEXT><![CDATA[Cell Lineage-Based Stratification for Glioblastoma.

Glioblastoma, the predominant adult malignant brain tumor, has been 
computationally classified into molecular subtypes whose functional relevance 
remains to be comprehensively established. Tumors from genetically engineered 
glioblastoma mouse models initiated by identical driver mutations in distinct 
cells of origin portray unique transcriptional profiles reflective of their 
respective lineage. Here, we identify corresponding transcriptional profiles in 
human glioblastoma and describe patient-derived xenografts with 
species-conserved subtype-discriminating functional properties. The 
oligodendrocyte lineage-associated glioblastoma subtype requires functional 
ERBB3 and harbors unique therapeutic sensitivities. These results highlight the 
importance of cell lineage in glioblastoma independent of driver mutations and 
provide a methodology for functional glioblastoma classification for future 
clinical investigations.]]></TEXT>

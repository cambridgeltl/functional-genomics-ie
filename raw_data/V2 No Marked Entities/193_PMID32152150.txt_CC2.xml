<TEXT><![CDATA[Systematic Establishment of Robustness and Standards in Patient-Derived 
Xenograft Experiments and Analysis.

Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are tumor-in-mouse models for cancer. PDX 
collections, such as the NCI PDXNet, are powerful resources for preclinical 
therapeutic testing. However, variations in experimental and analysis procedures 
have limited interpretability. To determine the robustness of PDX studies, the 
PDXNet tested temozolomide drug response for three prevalidated PDX models 
(sensitive, resistant, and intermediate) across four blinded PDX Development and 
Trial Centers using independently selected standard operating procedures. Each 
PDTC was able to correctly identify the sensitive, resistant, and intermediate 
models, and statistical evaluations were concordant across all groups. We also 
developed and benchmarked optimized PDX informatics pipelines, and these yielded 
robust assessments across xenograft biological replicates. These studies show 
that PDX drug responses and sequence results are reproducible across diverse 
experimental protocols. In addition, we share the range of experimental 
procedures that maintained robustness, as well as standardized cloud-based 
workflows for PDX exome-sequencing and RNA-sequencing analyses and for 
evaluating growth.]]></TEXT>

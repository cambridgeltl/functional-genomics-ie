<TEXT><![CDATA[Hispanic/Latino Patients with Gastric Adenocarcinoma Have Distinct Molecular 
Profiles Including a High Rate of Germline CDH1 Variants.

Hispanic/Latino patients have a higher incidence of gastric cancer and worse 
cancer-related outcomes compared with patients of other backgrounds. Whether 
there is a molecular basis for these disparities is unknown, as very few 
Hispanic/Latino patients have been included in previous studies. To determine 
the genomic landscape of gastric cancer in Hispanic/Latino patients, we 
performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on tumor samples from 
57 patients; germline analysis was conducted on 83 patients. The results were 
compared with data from Asian and White patients published by The Cancer Genome 
Atlas. Hispanic/Latino patients had a significantly larger proportion of 
genomically stable subtype tumors compared with Asian and White patients (65% 
vs. 21% vs. 20%, P < 0.001). Transcriptomic analysis identified molecular 
signatures that were prognostic. Of the 43 Hispanic/Latino patients with 
diffuse-type cancer, 7 (16%) had germline variants in CDH1. Variant carriers 
were significantly younger than noncarriers (41 vs. 50 years, P < 0.05). In 
silico algorithms predicted five variants to be deleterious. For two variants 
that were predicted to be benign, in vitro modeling demonstrated that these 
mutations conferred increased migratory capability, suggesting pathogenicity. 
Hispanic/Latino patients with gastric cancer possess unique genomic landscapes, 
including a high rate of CDH1 germline variants that may partially explain their 
aggressive clinical phenotypes. Individualized screening, genetic counseling, 
and treatment protocols based on patient ethnicity and race may be necessary.]]></TEXT>

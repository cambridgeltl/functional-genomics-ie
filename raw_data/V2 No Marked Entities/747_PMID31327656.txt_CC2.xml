Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Therapeutic Efficacy.

Reactivation of TÂ cell immunity by PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade has 
been shown to be a promising cancer therapeutic strategy. However, PD-L1 
immunohistochemical readout is inconsistent with patient response, which 
presents a clinical challenge to stratify patients. Because PD-L1 is heavily 
glycosylated, we developed a method to resolve this by removing the glycan 
moieties from cell surface antigens via enzymatic digestion, a process termed 
sample deglycosylation. Notably, deglycosylation significantly improves 
anti-PD-L1 antibody binding affinity and signal intensity, resulting in more 
accurate PD-L1 quantification and prediction of clinical outcome. This proposed 
method of PD-L1 antigen retrieval may provide a practical and timely approach to 
reduce false-negative patient stratification for guiding anti-PD-1/PD-L1 
therapy.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Platelet RNA as Pan-Tumor Biomarker for Cancer Detection.

Blood-based liquid biopsies are considered a screening approach for early cancer 
detection. Sequencing technologies enable in-depth analyses of nucleic acids, 
including mutant cell-free (cf) DNA in the plasma. However, in the blood of 
patients with early-stage cancer the detection level of mutant cfDNA is 
relatively low, and complicated by the natural presence of noncancer cfDNA 
mutants attributed to aging-related processes. Consequently, analysis of 
methylated cfDNA patterns and alternative approaches such as tumor-educated 
platelets are gaining traction for the detection of early-stage tumors. Here, we 
dissect the use of platelet RNA as a potential biomarker for the development of 
early-stage, pan-cancer blood tests.]]></TEXT>

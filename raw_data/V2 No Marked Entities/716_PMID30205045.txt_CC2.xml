<TEXT><![CDATA[The Genomic Landscape of Endocrine-Resistant Advanced Breast Cancers.

We integrated the genomic sequencing of 1,918 breast cancers, including 1,501 
hormone receptor-positive tumors, with detailed clinical information and 
treatment outcomes. In 692 tumors previously exposed to hormonal therapy, we 
identified an increased number of alterations in genes involved in the 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and in the estrogen receptor 
transcriptional machinery. Activating ERBB2 mutations and NF1 loss-of-function 
mutations were more than twice as common in endocrine resistant tumors. 
Alterations in other MAPK pathway genes (EGFR, KRAS, among others) and estrogen 
receptor transcriptional regulators (MYC, CTCF, FOXA1, and TBX3) were also 
enriched. Altogether, these alterations were present in 22% of tumors, mutually 
exclusive with ESR1 mutations, and associated with a shorter duration of 
response to subsequent hormonal therapies.]]></TEXT>

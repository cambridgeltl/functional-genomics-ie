Apoptosis is an important and necessary cell death program which promotes 
homeostasis and organismal survival. When dysregulated, however, it can lead to 
a myriad of pathologies from neurodegenerative diseases to cancer. Apoptosis is 
therefore the subject of intense study aimed at dissecting its pathways and 
molecular mechanisms. Although many assay methods exist for confirming whether 
an apoptotic response has occurred in vitro, most methods are destructive and 
involve laborious operator effort or specialized instrumentation. Here we 
describe a real-time, no-wash, microplate method which utilizes recombinant 
annexin V fusion proteins containing evolved binary subunits of NanoBiTâ„¢ 
luciferase. The fusion proteins, a time-released enzymatic substrate, a necrosis 
detection dye and exogenous calcium ions are delivered via an optimized and 
physiologically inert reagent directly to cells in culture at the time of 
treatment or dosing. Luminescent signals proportional to phosphatidylserine (PS) 
exposure and fluorescent signals generated as a result of loss of membrane 
integrity are then collected using a standard multimode plate reader at 
scheduled intervals over the exposure. The resulting luminescent and fluorescent 
data are then used to define the kinetics and magnitude of an apoptotic 
response. This study details our efforts to develop, characterize, and 
demonstrate the features of the assay by providing relevant examples from 
diverse cell models for programmed cell death.]]></TEXT>

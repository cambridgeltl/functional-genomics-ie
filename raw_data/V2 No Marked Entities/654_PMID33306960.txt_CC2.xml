<TEXT><![CDATA[The Identity of Human Tissue-Emigrant CD8(+) T Cells.

Lymphocyte migration is essential for adaptive immune surveillance. However, our 
current understanding of this process is rudimentary, because most human studies 
have been restricted to immunological analyses of blood and various tissues. To 
address this knowledge gap, we used an integrated approach to characterize 
tissue-emigrant lineages in thoracic duct lymph (TDL). The most prevalent immune 
cells in human and non-human primate efferent lymph were T cells. Cytolytic CD8+ 
T cell subsets with effector-like epigenetic and transcriptional signatures were 
clonotypically skewed and selectively confined to the intravascular circulation, 
whereas non-cytolytic CD8+ T cell subsets with stem-like epigenetic and 
transcriptional signatures predominated in tissues and TDL. Moreover, these 
anatomically distinct gene expression profiles were recapitulated within 
individual clonotypes, suggesting parallel differentiation programs independent 
of the expressed antigen receptor. Our collective dataset provides an atlas of 
the migratory immune system and defines the nature of tissue-emigrant CD8+ 
T cells that recirculate via TDL.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[An Integrated Gene Expression Landscape Profiling Approach to Identify Lung 
Tumor Endothelial Cell Heterogeneity and Angiogenic Candidates.

Heterogeneity of lung tumor endothelial cell (TEC) phenotypes across patients, 
species (human/mouse), and models (in vivo/in vitro) remains poorly inventoried 
at the single-cell level. We single-cell RNA (scRNA)-sequenced 56,771 
endothelial cells from human/mouse (peri)-tumoral lung and cultured human lung 
TECs, and detected 17 known and 16 previously unrecognized phenotypes, including 
TECs putatively regulating immune surveillance. We resolved the canonical tip 
TECs into a known migratory tip and a putative basement-membrane remodeling 
breach phenotype. Tip TEC signatures correlated with patient survival, and 
tip/breach TECs were most sensitive to vascular endothelial growth factor 
blockade. Only tip TECs were congruent across species/models and shared 
conserved markers. Integrated analysis of the scRNA-sequenced data with 
orthogonal multi-omics and meta-analysis data across different human tumors, 
validated by functional analysis, identified collagen modification as a 
candidate angiogenic pathway.]]></TEXT>

tissue-specific perturbation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Bcl9 and Pygopus (Pygo) are obligate Wnt/β-catenin cofactors in Drosophila, yet 
their contribution to Wnt signaling during vertebrate development remains 
unresolved. Combining zebrafish and mouse genetics, we document a conserved, 
β-catenin-associated function for BCL9 and Pygo proteins during vertebrate heart 
development. Disrupting the β-catenin-BCL9-Pygo complex results in a broadly 
maintained canonical Wnt response yet perturbs heart development and proper 
expression of key cardiac regulators. Our work highlights BCL9 and Pygo as 
selective β-catenin cofactors in a subset of canonical Wnt responses during 
vertebrate development. Moreover, our results implicate alterations in BCL9 and 
BCL9L in human congenital heart defects.]]></TEXT>

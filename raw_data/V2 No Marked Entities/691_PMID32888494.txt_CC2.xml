<TEXT><![CDATA[The Polygenic and Monogenic Basis of Blood Traits and Diseases.

Blood cells play essential roles in human health, underpinning physiological 
processes such as immunity, oxygen transport, and clotting, which when perturbed 
cause a significant global health burden. Here we integrate data from UK Biobank 
and a large-scale international collaborative effort, including data for 563,085 
European ancestry participants, and discover 5,106 new genetic variants 
independently associated with 29 blood cell phenotypes covering a range of 
variation impacting hematopoiesis. We holistically characterize the genetic 
architecture of hematopoiesis, assess the relevance of the omnigenic model to 
blood cell phenotypes, delineate relevant hematopoietic cell states influenced 
by regulatory genetic variants and gene networks, identify novel splice-altering 
variants mediating the associations, and assess the polygenic prediction 
potential for blood traits and clinical disorders at the interface of complex 
and Mendelian genetics. These results show the power of large-scale blood cell 
trait GWAS to interrogate clinically meaningful variants across a wide allelic 
spectrum of human variation.]]></TEXT>

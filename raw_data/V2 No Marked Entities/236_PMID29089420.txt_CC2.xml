Maternal imprinting at the Xist gene is essential to achieve paternal 
allele-specific imprinted X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals. 
However, the mechanism underlying Xist imprinting is unclear. Here we show that 
the Xist locus is coated with a broad H3K27me3 domain that is established during 
oocyte growth and persists through preimplantation development in mice. Loss of 
maternal H3K27me3 induces maternal Xist expression and maternal XCI in 
preimplantation embryos. Our study thus identifies maternal H3K27me3 as the 
imprinting mark of Xist.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[RNA-Mediated Feedback Control of Transcriptional Condensates.

Regulation of biological processes typically incorporates mechanisms that 
initiate and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often 
involve feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular 
process where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied 
extensively, but those involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. 
Modeling of the potential roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a 
non-equilibrium feedback control mechanism where low levels of RNA promote 
condensates formed by electrostatic interactions whereas relatively high levels 
promote dissolution of these condensates. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo 
experiments support a model where RNAs produced during early steps in 
transcription initiation stimulate condensate formation, whereas the burst of 
RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate dissolution. We propose 
that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback mechanism whereby 
transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest the process.]]></TEXT>

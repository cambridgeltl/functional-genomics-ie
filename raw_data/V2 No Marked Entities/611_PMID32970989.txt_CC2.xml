We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with both cellular heparan 
sulfate and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its receptor-binding 
domain (RBD). Docking studies suggest a heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site 
adjacent to the ACE2-binding site. Both ACE2 and heparin can bind independently 
to spike protein inÂ vitro, and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin 
as a scaffold. Electron micrographs of spike protein suggests that heparin 
enhances the open conformation of the RBD that binds ACE2. On cells, spike 
protein binding depends on both heparan sulfate and ACE2. Unfractionated 
heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, heparin lyases, and lung heparan sulfate 
potently block spike protein binding and/or infection by pseudotyped virus and 
authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. We suggest a model in which viral attachment and 
infection involves heparan sulfate-dependent enhancement of binding to ACE2. 
Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous 
heparin presents new therapeutic opportunities.]]></TEXT>

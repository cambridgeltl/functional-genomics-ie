Markers and Clinical Trajectories.

Identifying the earliest somatic changes in prostate cancer can give important 
insights into tumor evolution and aids in stratifying high- from low-risk 
disease. We integrated whole genome, transcriptome and methylome analysis of 
early-onset prostate cancers (diagnosis ≤55 years). Characterization across 292 
prostate cancer genomes revealed age-related genomic alterations and a 
clock-like enzymatic-driven mutational process contributing to the earliest 
mutations in prostate cancer patients. Our integrative analysis identified four 
molecular subgroups, including a particularly aggressive subgroup with recurrent 
duplications associated with increased expression of ESRP1, which we validate in 
12,000 tissue microarray tumors. Finally, we combined the patterns of molecular 
co-occurrence and risk-based subgroup information to deconvolve the molecular 
and clinical trajectories of prostate cancer from single patient samples.]]></TEXT>

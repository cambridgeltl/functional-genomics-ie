synthesis through BLM and RAD52.

Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomerase-independent telomere 
maintenance mechanism that occurs in a subset of cancers. One of the hallmarks 
of ALT cancer is the excessively clustered telomeres in promyelocytic leukemia 
(PML) bodies, represented as large bright telomere foci. Here, we present a 
model system that generates telomere clustering in nuclear polySUMO (small 
ubiquitin-like modification)/polySIM (SUMO-interacting motif) condensates, 
analogous to PML bodies, and thus artificially engineered ALT-associated PML 
body (APB)-like condensates in vivo. We observed that the ALT-like phenotypes 
(i.e., a small fraction of heterogeneous telomere lengths and formation of C 
circles) are rapidly induced by introducing the APB-like condensates together 
with BLM through its helicase domain, accompanied by ssDNA generation and RPA 
accumulation at telomeres. Moreover, these events lead to mitotic DNA synthesis 
(MiDAS) at telomeres mediated by RAD52 through its highly conserved N-terminal 
domain. We propose that the clustering of large amounts of telomeres in human 
cancers promotes ALT that is mediated by MiDAS, analogous to Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae type II ALT survivors.]]></TEXT>

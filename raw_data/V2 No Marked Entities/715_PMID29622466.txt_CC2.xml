<TEXT><![CDATA[Comparative Molecular Analysis of Gastrointestinal Adenocarcinomas.

We analyzed 921 adenocarcinomas of the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum to 
examine shared and distinguishing molecular characteristics of gastrointestinal 
tract adenocarcinomas (GIACs). Hypermutated tumors were distinct regardless of 
cancer type and comprised those enriched for insertions/deletions, representing 
microsatellite instability cases with epigenetic silencing of MLH1 in the 
context of CpG island methylator phenotype, plus tumors with elevated 
single-nucleotide variants associated with mutations in POLE. Tumors with 
chromosomal instability were diverse, with gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas 
harboring fragmented genomes associated with genomic doubling and distinct 
mutational signatures. We identified a group of tumors in the colon and rectum 
lacking hypermutation and aneuploidy termed genome stable and enriched in DNA 
hypermethylation and mutations in KRAS, SOX9, and PCBP1.]]></TEXT>

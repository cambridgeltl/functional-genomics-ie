Tumor-Educated Platelets.

Blood-based liquid biopsies, including tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs), 
have emerged as promising biomarker sources for non-invasive detection of 
cancer. Here we demonstrate that particle-swarm optimization (PSO)-enhanced 
algorithms enable efficient selection of RNA biomarker panels from platelet 
RNA-sequencing libraries (n = 779). This resulted in accurate TEP-based 
detection of early- and late-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 518 
late-stage validation cohort, accuracy, 88%; AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92-0.96; p < 
0.001; n = 106 early-stage validation cohort, accuracy, 81%; AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 
0.83-0.95; p < 0.001), independent of age of the individuals, smoking habits, 
whole-blood storage time, and various inflammatory conditions. PSO enabled 
selection of gene panels to diagnose cancer from TEPs, suggesting that swarm 
intelligence may also benefit the optimization of diagnostics readout of other 
liquid biopsy biosources.]]></TEXT>

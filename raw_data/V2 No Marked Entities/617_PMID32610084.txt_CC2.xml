<TEXT><![CDATA[Origin and Function of Stress-Induced IL-6 in Murine Models.

Acute psychological stress has long been known to decrease host fitness to 
inflammation in a wide variety of diseases, but how this occurs is incompletely 
understood. Using mouse models, we show that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the 
dominant cytokine inducible upon acute stress alone. Stress-inducible IL-6 is 
produced from brown adipocytes in a beta-3-adrenergic-receptor-dependent 
fashion. During stress, endocrine IL-6 is the required instructive signal for 
mediating hyperglycemia through hepatic gluconeogenesis, which is necessary for 
anticipating and fueling "fight or flight" responses. This adaptation comes at 
the cost of enhancing mortality to a subsequent inflammatory challenge. These 
findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the ontogeny and adaptive 
purpose of IL-6 as a bona fide stress hormone coordinating systemic 
immunometabolic reprogramming. This brain-brown fat-liver axis might provide new 
insights into brown adipose tissue as a stress-responsive endocrine organ and 
mechanistic insight into targeting this axis in the treatment of inflammatory 
and neuropsychiatric diseases.]]></TEXT>

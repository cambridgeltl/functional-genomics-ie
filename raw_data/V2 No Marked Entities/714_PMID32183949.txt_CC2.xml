Dendritic Cell Paucity Leads to Dysfunctional Immune Surveillance in Pancreatic 
Cancer.

Here, we utilized spontaneous models of pancreatic and lung cancer to examine 
how neoantigenicity shapes tumor immunity and progression. As expected, 
neoantigen expression during lung adenocarcinoma development leads to 
T cell-mediated immunity and disease restraint. By contrast, neoantigen 
expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) results in exacerbation of 
a fibro-inflammatory microenvironment that drives disease progression and 
metastasis. Pathogenic TH17 responses are responsible for this 
neoantigen-induced tumor progression in PDAC. Underlying these divergent T cell 
responses in pancreas and lung cancer are differences in infiltrating 
conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Overcoming cDC deficiency in early-stage 
PDAC leads to disease restraint, while restoration of cDC function in advanced 
PDAC restores tumor-restraining immunity and enhances responsiveness to 
radiation therapy.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[SnapShot: Extracellular Vesicles.

Cells release a variety of extracellular vesicles (EVs; including exosomes, 
microvesicles, and many others) into their environment. EVs can bud in endosomes 
or directly at the plasma membrane, carrying a selection of components from the 
cell and displaying various functional properties. Different techniques can be 
used to separate EV subtypes and EVs from co-isolated components, resulting in 
preparations of different abundance and purity.]]></TEXT>

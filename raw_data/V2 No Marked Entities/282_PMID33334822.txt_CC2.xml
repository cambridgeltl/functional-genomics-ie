<TEXT><![CDATA[A feed-forward regulatory loop in adipose tissue promotes signaling by the 
hepatokine FGF21.

The cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway is activated by metabolic 
stress and promotes the development of metabolic syndrome, including 
hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and insulin resistance. This integrated 
physiological response involves cross-talk between different organs. Here we 
demonstrate that JNK signaling in adipocytes causes an increased circulating 
concentration of the hepatokine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) that 
regulates systemic metabolism. The mechanism of organ crosstalk is mediated by a 
feed-forward regulatory loop caused by JNK-regulated FGF21 autocrine signaling 
in adipocytes that promotes increased expression of the adipokine adiponectin 
and subsequent hepatic expression of the hormone FGF21. The mechanism of organ 
cross-talk places circulating adiponectin downstream of autocrine FGF21 
expressed by adipocytes and upstream of endocrine FGF21 expressed by 
hepatocytes. This regulatory loop represents a novel signaling paradigm that 
connects autocrine and endocrine signaling modes of the same hormone in 
different tissues.]]></TEXT>

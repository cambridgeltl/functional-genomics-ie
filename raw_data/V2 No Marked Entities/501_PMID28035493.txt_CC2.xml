<TEXT><![CDATA[Methods to detect apoptotic cell death.

In concert with the increased understanding that there are many ways for cells 
to die, several methods have been developed to detect cell death. The 
classification of cell death posed some difficulties that were overcome by 
implementing strict selection criteria that should also apply to the detection 
methods. The selection of assays is based on morphological criteria and 
distinguishable marks of apoptotic patways. The detection of apoptosis includes 
methods related to membrane alterations, DNA fragmentation, cytotoxicity and 
cell proliferation, mitochondrial damage, immunological detection and mechanism 
based assays. Other less frequently used detections of apoptosis are: (a) 
light-scattering flow cytometry to avoid underestimating the extent and timing 
of apoptosis, (b) time-lapse microscopy perfusion platform to support the 
temporal aspects of detection, to measure cell surface area and cellular 
adhesion, and (c) genotoxicity specific chromatin changes. Attention is called 
to the advantages and limitations of various methods.]]></TEXT>

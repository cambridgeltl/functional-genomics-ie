<TEXT><![CDATA[A cohesin/HUSH- and LINC-dependent pathway controls ribosomal DNA double-strand 
break repair.

The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) represents a particularly unstable locus undergoing 
frequent breakage. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within rDNA induce both rDNA 
transcriptional repression and nucleolar segregation, but the link between the 
two events remains unclear. Here we found that DSBs induced on rDNA trigger 
transcriptional repression in a cohesin- and HUSH (human silencing hub) 
complex-dependent manner throughout the cell cycle. In S/G2 cells, 
transcriptional repression is further followed by extended resection within the 
interior of the nucleolus, DSB mobilization at the nucleolar periphery within 
nucleolar caps, and repair by homologous recombination. We showed that nuclear 
envelope invaginations frequently connect the nucleolus and that rDNA DSB 
mobilization, but not transcriptional repression, involves the nuclear 
envelope-associated LINC complex and the actin pathway. Altogether, our data 
indicate that rDNA break localization at the nucleolar periphery is not a direct 
consequence of transcriptional repression but rather is an active process that 
shares features with the mobilization of persistent DSB in active genes and 
heterochromatin.]]></TEXT>

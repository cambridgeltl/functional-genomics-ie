<TEXT><![CDATA[A Pharmacogenomic Landscape in Human Liver Cancers.

Liver cancers are highly heterogeneous with poor prognosis and drug response. A 
better understanding between genetic alterations and drug responses would 
facilitate precision treatment for liver cancers. To characterize the landscape 
of pharmacogenomic interactions in liver cancers, we developed a protocol to 
establish human liver cancer cell models at a success rate of around 50% and 
generated the Liver Cancer Model Repository (LIMORE) with 81 cell models. LIMORE 
represented genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity of primary cancers. 
Interrogation of the pharmacogenomic landscape of LIMORE discovered unexplored 
gene-drug associations, including synthetic lethalities to prevalent alterations 
in liver cancers. Moreover, predictive biomarker candidates were suggested for 
the selection of sorafenib-responding patients. LIMORE provides a rich resource 
facilitating drug discovery in liver cancers.]]></TEXT>

cirrhosis.

Liver cirrhosis is associated with defective vaccine responses and increased 
infections. Dysregulated B cell compartments in cirrhotic patients have been 
noticed but not well characterized, especially in the spleen. Here, we 
comprehensively investigated B cell perturbations from the spleens and 
peripheral blood of cirrhotic patients. We found that liver cirrhosis 
significantly depleted both switched and nonswitched splenic memory B cells, 
which was further confirmed histologically. Bulk RNA-seq revealed significant 
metabolic defects as the potential mechanism for the impaired splenic B cell 
functions. Functionally, the splenic memory B cells from cirrhotic patients 
showed strong metabolic defects and reduced proliferation compared with those 
from healthy controls. Thus, liver cirrhosis extensively disturbs the splenic 
and peripheral B cell compartments, which may contribute to defective humoral 
immunity during liver cirrhosis.

COVID-19.

The contribution of CD4+ T cells to protective or pathogenic immune responses to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we present single-cell 
transcriptomic analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4+ T cells from 40 
COVID-19 patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized 
patients, we found increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells 
and cytotoxic T helper (TH) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and 
reduced proportion of SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (TREG). 
Importantly, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic TFH response 
was observed early in the illness, which correlated negatively with antibody 
levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Polyfunctional TH1 and TH17 cell subsets 
were underrepresented in the repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells 
compared to influenza-reactive CD4+ T cells. Together, our analyses provide 
insights into the gene expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells 
in distinct disease severities.]]></TEXT>

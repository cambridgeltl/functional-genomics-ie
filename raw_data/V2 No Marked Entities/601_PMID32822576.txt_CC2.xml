Sequencing.

Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits heterogeneity that 
enables adaptability, limits therapeutic success, and remains incompletely 
understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of metastatic lung cancer was 
performed using 49 clinical biopsies obtained from 30 patients before and during 
targeted therapy. Over 20,000 cancer and tumor microenvironment (TME) 
single-cell profiles exposed a rich and dynamic tumor ecosystem. scRNA-seq of 
cancer cells illuminated targetable oncogenes beyond those detected clinically. 
Cancer cells surviving therapy as residual disease (RD) expressed an 
alveolar-regenerative cell signature suggesting a therapy-induced primitive 
cell-state transition, whereas those present at on-therapy progressive disease 
(PD) upregulated kynurenine, plasminogen, and gap-junction pathways. Active 
T-lymphocytes and decreased macrophages were present at RD and immunosuppressive 
cell states characterized PD. Biological features revealed by scRNA-seq were 
biomarkers of clinical outcomes in independent cohorts. This study highlights 
how therapy-induced adaptation of the multi-cellular ecosystem of metastatic 
cancer shapes clinical outcomes.]]></TEXT>

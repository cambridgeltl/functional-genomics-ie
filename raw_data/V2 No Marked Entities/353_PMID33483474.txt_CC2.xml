The nonautonomous cell death by entosis was mediated by the so-called 
cell-in-cell structures, which were believed to kill the internalized cells by a 
mechanism dependent on acidified lysosomes. However, the precise values and 
roles of pH critical for the death of the internalized cells remained 
undetermined yet. We creatively employed keima, a fluorescent protein that 
displays different excitation spectra in responding to pH changes, to monitor 
the pH dynamics of the entotic vacuoles during cell-in-cell mediated death. We 
found that different cells varied in their basal intracellular pH, and the pH 
was relatively stable for entotic vacuoles containing live cells, but sharply 
dropped to a narrow range along with the inner cell death. In contrast, the 
lipidation of entotic vacuoles by LC3 displayed previously underappreciated 
complex patterns associated with entotic and apoptotic death, respectively. The 
pH decline seemed to play distinct roles in the two types of inner cell deaths, 
where apoptosis is preceded with moderate pH decline while a profound pH decline 
is likely to be determinate for entotic death. Whereas the cancer cells seemed 
to be lesser tolerant to acidified environments than noncancerous cells, 
manipulating vacuolar pH could effectively control inner cell fates and switch 
the ways whereby inner cell die. Together, this study demonstrated for the first 
time the pH dynamics of entotic vacuoles that dictate the fates of internalized 
cells, providing a rationale for tuning cellular pH as a potential way to treat 
cell-in-cell associated diseases such as cancer.]]></TEXT>

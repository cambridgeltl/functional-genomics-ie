The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is 
causing a global pandemic, and cases continue to rise. Most infected individuals 
experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is 
unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that could contribute 
to immunity. We performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered 
from mild COVID-19 to determine whether they develop and sustain multifaceted 
SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed 
SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, neutralizing plasma, and 
memory B and memory T cells that persisted for at least 3 months. Our data 
further reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. 
Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics 
associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and 
expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors 
capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. 
Therefore, mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display 
functional hallmarks of antiviral immunity.]]></TEXT>

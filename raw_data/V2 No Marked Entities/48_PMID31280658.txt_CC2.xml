<TEXT><![CDATA[Autophagy links MTOR and GABA signaling in the brain.

The disruption of MTOR-regulated macroautophagy/autophagy was previously shown 
to cause autistic-like abnormalities; however, the underlying molecular defects 
remained largely unresolved. In a recent study, we demonstrated that autophagy 
deficiency induced by conditional Atg7 deletion in either forebrain GABAergic 
inhibitory or excitatory neurons leads to a similar set of autistic-like 
behavioral abnormalities even when induced following the peak period of synaptic 
pruning during postnatal neurodevelopment. Our proteomic analysis and molecular 
dissection further revealed a mechanism in which the GABAA receptor trafficking 
function of GABARAP (gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor associated protein) family 
proteins was compromised as they became sequestered by SQSTM1/p62-positive 
aggregates formed due to autophagy deficiency. Our discovery of autophagy as a 
link between MTOR and GABA signaling may have implications not limited to 
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders, but could potentially be 
involved in other human pathologies such as cancer and diabetes in which both 
pathways are implicated.]]></TEXT>

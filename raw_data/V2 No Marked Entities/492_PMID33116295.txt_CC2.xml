populations during adult axolotl limb regeneration process.

While the capacity to regenerate tissues or limbs is limited in mammals, 
including humans, axolotls are able to regrow entire limbs and major organs 
after incurring a wound. The wound blastema has been extensively studied in limb 
regeneration. However, due to the inadequate characterization of ECM and cell 
subpopulations involved in the regeneration process, the discovery of the key 
drivers for human limb regeneration remains unknown. In this study, we applied 
large-scale single-cell RNA sequencing to classify cells throughout the adult 
axolotl limb regeneration process, uncovering a novel regeneration-specific 
mitochondria-related cluster supporting regeneration through energy providing 
and the ECM secretion (COL2+) cluster contributing to regeneration through 
cell-cell interactions signals. We also discovered the dedifferentiation and 
re-differentiation of the COL1+/COL2+ cellular subpopulation and exposed a 
COL2-mitochondria subcluster supporting the musculoskeletal system regeneration. 
On the basis of these findings, we reconstructed the dynamic single-cell 
transcriptome of adult axolotl limb regenerative process, and identified the 
novel regenerative mitochondria-related musculoskeletal populations, which 
yielded deeper insights into the crucial interactions between cell clusters 
within the regenerative microenvironment.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Cell Types of the Human Retina and Its Organoids at Single-Cell Resolution.

Human organoids recapitulating the cell-type diversity and function of their 
target organ are valuable for basic and translational research. We developed 
light-sensitive human retinal organoids with multiple nuclear and synaptic 
layers and functional synapses. We sequenced the RNA of 285,441 single cells 
from these organoids at seven developmental time points and from the periphery, 
fovea, pigment epithelium and choroid of light-responsive adult human retinas, 
and performed histochemistry. Cell types in organoids matured in vitro to a 
stable "developed" state at a rate similar to human retina development in vivo. 
Transcriptomes of organoid cell types converged toward the transcriptomes of 
adult peripheral retinal cell types. Expression of disease-associated genes was 
cell-type-specific in adult retina, and cell-type specificity was retained in 
organoids. We implicate unexpected cell types in diseases such as macular 
degeneration. This resource identifies cellular targets for studying disease 
mechanisms in organoids and for targeted repair in human retinas.]]></TEXT>

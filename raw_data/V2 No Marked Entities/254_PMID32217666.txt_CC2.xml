promoter-proximal sequence elements.

Cell type-specific transcriptional programs that drive differentiation of 
specialized cell types are key players in development and tissue regeneration. 
One of the most dramatic changes in the transcription program in Drosophila 
occurs with the transition from proliferating spermatogonia to differentiating 
spermatocytes, with >3000 genes either newly expressed or expressed from new 
alternative promoters in spermatocytes. Here we show that opening of these 
promoters from their closed state in precursor cells requires function of the 
spermatocyte-specific tMAC complex, localized at the promoters. The 
spermatocyte-specific promoters lack the previously identified canonical core 
promoter elements except for the Inr. Instead, these promoters are enriched for 
the binding site for the TALE-class homeodomain transcription factors Achi/Vis 
and for a motif originally identified under tMAC ChIP-seq peaks. The tMAC motif 
resembles part of the previously identified 14-bp Î²2UE1 element critical for 
spermatocyte-specific expression. Analysis of downstream sequences relative to 
transcription start site usage suggested that ACA and CNAAATT motifs at specific 
positions can help promote efficient transcription initiation. Our results 
reveal how promoter-proximal sequence elements that recruit and are acted upon 
by cell type-specific chromatin binding complexes help establish a robust, cell 
type-specific transcription program for terminal differentiation.]]></TEXT>

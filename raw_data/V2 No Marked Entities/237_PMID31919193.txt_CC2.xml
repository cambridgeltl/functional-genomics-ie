<TEXT><![CDATA[A single-cell atlas of the developing Drosophila ovary identifies follicle stem 
cell progenitors.

Addressing the complexity of organogenesis at a system-wide level requires a 
complete understanding of adult cell types, their origin, and precursor 
relationships. The Drosophila ovary has been a model to study how coordinated 
stem cell units, germline, and somatic follicle stem cells maintain and renew an 
organ. However, lack of cell type-specific tools have limited our ability to 
study the origin of individual cell types and stem cell units. Here, we used a 
single-cell RNA sequencing approach to uncover all known cell types of the 
developing ovary, reveal transcriptional signatures, and identify cell 
type-specific markers for lineage tracing. Our study identifies a novel cell 
type corresponding to the elusive follicle stem cell precursors and predicts 
subtypes of known cell types. Altogether, we reveal a previously unanticipated 
complexity of the developing ovary and provide a comprehensive resource for the 
systematic analysis of ovary morphogenesis.]]></TEXT>

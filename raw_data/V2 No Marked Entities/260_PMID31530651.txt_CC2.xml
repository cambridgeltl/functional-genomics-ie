Cellular homeostasis requires transcriptional outputs to be coordinated, and 
many events post-transcription initiation can dictate the levels and functions 
of mature transcripts. To systematically identify regulators of inducible gene 
expression, we performed high-throughput RNAi screening of the Drosophila 
Metallothionein A (MtnA) promoter. This revealed that the Integrator complex, 
which has a well-established role in 3' end processing of small nuclear RNAs 
(snRNAs), attenuates MtnA transcription during copper stress. Integrator complex 
subunit 11 (IntS11) endonucleolytically cleaves MtnA transcripts, resulting in 
premature transcription termination and degradation of the nascent RNAs by the 
RNA exosome, a complex also identified in the screen. Using RNA-seq, we then 
identified >400 additional Drosophila protein-coding genes whose expression 
increases upon Integrator depletion. We focused on a subset of these genes and 
confirmed that Integrator is bound to their 5' ends and negatively regulates 
their transcription via IntS11 endonuclease activity. Many noncatalytic 
Integrator subunits, which are largely dispensable for snRNA processing, also 
have regulatory roles at these protein-coding genes, possibly by controlling 
Integrator recruitment or RNA polymerase II dynamics. Altogether, our results 
suggest that attenuation via Integrator cleavage limits production of many 
full-length mRNAs, allowing precise control of transcription outputs.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular Hierarchies and Impaired Developmental 
Trajectories in Pediatric Ependymoma.

Ependymoma is a heterogeneous entity of central nervous system tumors with 
well-established molecular groups. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to 
analyze ependymomas across molecular groups and anatomic locations to 
investigate their intratumoral heterogeneity and developmental origins. 
Ependymomas are composed of a cellular hierarchy initiating from 
undifferentiated populations, which undergo impaired differentiation toward 
three lineages of neuronal-glial fate specification. While prognostically 
favorable groups of ependymoma predominantly harbor differentiated cells, 
aggressive groups are enriched for undifferentiated cell populations. The 
delineated transcriptomic signatures correlate with patient survival and define 
molecular dependencies for targeted treatment approaches. Taken together, our 
analyses reveal a developmental hierarchy underlying ependymomas relevant to 
biological and clinical behavior.]]></TEXT>

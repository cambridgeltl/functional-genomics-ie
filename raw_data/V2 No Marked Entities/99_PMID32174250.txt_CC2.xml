<TEXT><![CDATA[The NEDD4-USP13 axis facilitates autophagy via deubiquitinating PIK3C3.

Macroautophagy/autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic bioprocess, 
plays an important role in the bulk degradation of intracellular macromolecules, 
organelles, and invading pathogens. PIK3C3/VPS34 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
catalytic subunit type 3) functions as a key protein in autophagy initiation and 
progression. The activity of PIK3C3 is tightly regulated by multiple 
post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, however, the 
regulatory mechanisms underpinning the reversible deubiquitination of PIK3C3 
remain poorly understood. Recently, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase 
NEDD4/NEDD4-1 as a positive regulator of autophagy through decreasing the 
K48-linked ubiquitination of PIK3C3 by recruiting USP13.]]></TEXT>

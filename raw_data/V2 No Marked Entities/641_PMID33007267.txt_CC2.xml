Inhibition.

Although treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors (ICIs) can produce remarkably durable responses, most patients 
develop early disease progression. Furthermore, initial response assessment by 
conventional imaging is often unable to identify which patients will achieve 
durable clinical benefit (DCB). Here, we demonstrate that pre-treatment 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral CD8 TÂ cell levels are independently 
associated with DCB. We further show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion 
can aid in identification of patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these 
determinants, we developed and validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter 
assay (DIREct-On, Durable Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling 
and ctDNA-On-treatment) that robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB 
with higher accuracy than any individual feature. Taken together, these results 
demonstrate that integrated ctDNA and circulating immune cell profiling can 
provide accurate, noninvasive, and early forecasting of ultimate outcomes for 
NSCLC patients receiving ICIs.]]></TEXT>

The proteostasis network is regulated by transcellular communication to promote 
health and fitness in metazoans. In Caenorhabditis elegans, signals from the 
germline initiate the decline of proteostasis and repression of cell stress 
responses at reproductive maturity, indicating that commitment to reproduction 
is detrimental to somatic health. Here we show that proteostasis and stress 
resilience are also regulated by embryo-to-mother communication in reproductive 
adults. To identify genes that act directly in the reproductive system to 
regulate somatic proteostasis, we performed a tissue targeted genetic screen for 
germline modifiers of polyglutamine aggregation in muscle cells. We found that 
inhibiting the formation of the extracellular vitelline layer of the fertilized 
embryo inside the uterus suppresses aggregation, improves stress resilience in 
an HSF-1-dependent manner, and restores the heat-shock response in the somatic 
tissues of the parent. This pathway relies on DAF-16/FOXO activation in vulval 
tissues to maintain stress resilience in the mother, suggesting that the 
integrity of the embryo is monitored by the vulva to detect damage and initiate 
an organismal protective response. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed 
transcellular pathway that links the integrity of the developing progeny to 
proteostasis regulation in the parent.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Evaluating the Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutation D614G on Transmissibility 
and Pathogenicity.

Global dispersal and increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
variant D614G are suggestive of a selective advantage but may also be due to a 
random founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of 
spike D614G in the United Kingdom using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 
sequences. Despite the availability of a large dataset, well represented by both 
spike 614 variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive 
selection. Population genetic analysis indicates that 614G increases in 
frequency relative to 614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We 
do not find any indication that patients infected with the spike 614G variant 
have higher COVID-19 mortality or clinical severity, but 614G is associated with 
higher viral load and younger age of patients. Significant differences in growth 
and size of 614G phylogenetic clusters indicate a need for continued study of 
this variant.

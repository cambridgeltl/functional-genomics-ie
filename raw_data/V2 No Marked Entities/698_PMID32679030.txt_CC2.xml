<TEXT><![CDATA[Origins and Proliferative States of Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells.

Human cerebral cortex size and complexity has increased greatly during 
evolution. While increased progenitor diversity and enhanced proliferative 
potential play important roles in human neurogenesis and gray matter expansion, 
the mechanisms of human oligodendrogenesis and white matter expansion remain 
largely unknown. Here, we identify EGFR-expressing "Pre-OPCs" that originate 
from outer radial glial cells (oRGs) and undergo mitotic somal translocation 
(MST) during division. oRG-derived Pre-OPCs provide an additional source of 
human cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and define a lineage 
trajectory. We further show that human OPCs undergo consecutive symmetric 
divisions to exponentially increase the progenitor pool size. Additionally, we 
find that the OPC-enriched gene, PCDH15, mediates daughter cell repulsion and 
facilitates proliferation. These findings indicate properties of OPC derivation, 
proliferation, and dispersion important for human white matter expansion and 
myelination.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Reduced risk of apoptosis: mechanisms of stress responses.

Apoptosis signaling pathways are integrated into a wider network of 
interconnected apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways that regulate a broad range 
of cell responses from cell death to growth, development and stress responses. 
An important trigger for anti- or pro-apoptotic cell responses are different 
forms of stress including hypoxia, energy deprivation, DNA damage or 
inflammation. Stress duration and intensity determine whether the cell's 
response will be improved cell survival, due to stress adaptation, or cell death 
by apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy. Although the interplay between enhanced 
stress tolerance and modulation of apoptosis triggering is not yet fully 
understood, there is a substantial body of experimental evidence demonstrating 
that apoptosis and anti-apoptosis signaling pathways can be manipulated to 
trigger or delay apoptosis in vitro or in vivo. Anti-apoptotic strategies cover 
a broad range of approaches. These interventions include mediators that prevent 
apoptosis (trophic factors and cytokines), apoptosis inhibition (caspase 
inhibition, stimulation of anti-apoptotic or inhibition of pro-apoptotic 
proteins and elimination of apoptotic stimulus), adaptive stress responses 
(induction of maintenance and repair, caspase inactivation) and cell-cell 
interactions (blocking engulfment and modified micro environment). There is a 
consensus that preclinical efficacy and safety evaluations of anti-apoptotic 
strategies should be performed with protocols that simulate as closely as 
possible the effects of aging, gender, risk factors, comorbidities and 
co-medications.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[The degree of enhancer or promoter activity is reflected by the levels and 
directionality of eRNA transcription.

Gene expression is regulated by promoters, which initiate transcription, and 
enhancers, which control their temporal and spatial activity. However, the 
discovery that mammalian enhancers also initiate transcription questions the 
inherent differences between enhancers and promoters. Here, we investigate the 
transcriptional properties of enhancers during Drosophila embryogenesis using 
characterized developmental enhancers. We show that while the timing of enhancer 
transcription is generally correlated with enhancer activity, the levels and 
directionality of transcription are highly varied among active enhancers. To 
assess how this impacts function, we developed a dual transgenic assay to 
simultaneously measure enhancer and promoter activities from a single element in 
the same embryo. Extensive transgenic analysis revealed a relationship between 
the direction of endogenous transcription and the ability to function as an 
enhancer or promoter in vivo, although enhancer RNA (eRNA) production and 
activity are not always strictly coupled. Some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) 
can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression. 
Conversely, bidirectional promoters often act as strong enhancers, while 
unidirectional promoters generally cannot. The balance between enhancer and 
promoter activity is generally reflected in the levels and directionality of 
eRNA transcription and is likely an inherent sequence property of the elements 
themselves.]]></TEXT>

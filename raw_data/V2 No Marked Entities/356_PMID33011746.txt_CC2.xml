<TEXT><![CDATA[Requirement for Serine-384 in Caspase-2 processing and activity.

aspase-2 is a unique and conservative cysteine protease which plays an 
important role in several cellular processes including apoptotic cell death. 
Although the molecular mechanisms of its activation remain largely unclear, a 
major role belongs to the architecture of the caspase-2 active center. We 
demonstrate that the substitution of the putative phosphorylation site of 
caspase-2, Serine-384 to Alanine, blocks caspase-2 processing and decreases its 
enzymatic activity. Strikingly, in silico analysis using molecular dynamics 
simulations has shown that Serine-384 is crucially involved in interactions 
within the caspase-2 active center. It stabilizes Arginine-378, which forms a 
crucial hydrogen bond with the aspartate residue of a substrate. Hence, 
Serine-384 is essential for supporting a proper architecture of the active 
center of caspase-2. Moreover, molecular modeling strongly proved steric 
inaccessibility of Ser-384 to be phosphorylated. Importantly, a multiple 
alignment has demonstrated that both Serine-384 and Arg-378 residues are highly 
conservative across all members of caspase family, which allows us to suggest 
that this diade is indispensable for caspase processing and activity. 
Spontaneous mutations in this diade might influence oncosuppressive function of 
caspases, in particular of caspase-2. Likewise, the mutation of Ser-384 is 
associated with the development of lung squamous cell carcinoma and 
adenocarcinoma. Taken together, we have uncovered a central feature of the 
caspase-2 activation mechanism which is crucial for the regulation of its 
signaling network.]]></TEXT>

SQSTM1/p62-mediated autophagic degradation of pattern recognition receptor 
DDX58/RIG-I.

DDX58/RIG-I, is a critical pattern recognition receptor for viral RNA, which 
plays an essential role in antiviral immunity. Its posttranslational 
modifications and stability are tightly regulated to mediate the moderate 
production of type I IFN to maintain the immune homeostasis. Recently, we 
reported that macroautophagy/autophagy balances type I IFN signaling through 
selective degradation of ISG15-associated DDX58 via LRRC25. However, the 
regulatory mechanism about the autophagic degradation of DDX58 remains largely 
undefined. Here, we identified LRRC59 as a vital positive regulator of 
DDX58-mediated type I IFN signaling. Upon virus infection, LRRC59 specifically 
interacted with ISG15-associated DDX58 and blocked its association with LRRC25, 
the secondary receptor to deliver DDX58 to autophagosomes for 
SQSTM1/p62-dependent degradation, leading to the stronger antiviral immune 
responses. Thus, our study reveals a novel regulatory role of selective 
autophagy in innate antiviral responses mediated by the cross-regulation of LRRC 
family members. These data further provide insights into the crosstalk between 
autophagy and innate immune responses.]]></TEXT>

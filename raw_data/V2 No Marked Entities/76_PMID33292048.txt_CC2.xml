<TEXT><![CDATA[SIRT1 - a new mammalian substrate of nuclear autophagy.

Macroautophagic/autophagic degradation of nuclear components (or nuclear 
autophagy) is a poorly understood area in autophagy research. We previously 
reported the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 (lamin B1) as a nuclear autophagy 
substrate in primary human cells, stimulating the investigation of nuclear 
autophagy in the mammalian system. We recently reported the sirtuin protein 
SIRT1 as a new selective substrate of nuclear autophagy in senescence and aging. 
Upon senescence of primary human cells, SIRT1 degradation is mediated by a 
direct nuclear SIRT1-LC3 interaction, followed by nucleus-to-cytoplasm shuttling 
of SIRT1 and autophagosome-lysosome degradation. In vivo, SIRT1 is downregulated 
by lysosomes in hematopoietic and immune organs upon natural aging in mice and 
in aged human T cells. Our study identified another substrate of nuclear 
autophagy and suggests a new strategy to promote SIRT1-mediated health benefits 
by suppressing its autophagic degradation.]]></TEXT>

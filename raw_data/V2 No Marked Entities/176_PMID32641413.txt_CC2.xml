Progression.

Cancer develops through the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic aberrations. 
To identify sequential molecular alterations that occur during the development 
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we compared 52 early and 108 overt HCC 
samples by genome sequencing. Gene mutations in the p53/RB1 pathway, WNT 
pathway, MLL protein family, SWI/SNF complexes, and AKT/PI3K pathway were common 
in HCC. In the early phase of all entities, TERT was the most frequently 
upregulated gene owing to diverse mechanisms. Despite frequent somatic mutations 
in driver genes, including CTNNB1 and TP53, early HCC was a separate molecular 
entity from overt HCC, as each had a distinct expression profile. Notably, WNT 
target genes were not activated in early HCC regardless of CTNNB1 mutation 
status because β-catenin did not translocate into the nucleus due to the 
E-cadherin/β-catenin complex at the membrane. Conversely, WNT targets were 
definitively upregulated in overt HCC, with CTNNB1 mutation associated with 
downregulation of CDH1 and hypomethylation of CpG islands in target genes. 
Similarly, cell-cycle genes downstream of the p53/RB pathway were upregulated 
only in overt HCC, with TP53 or RB1 gene mutations associated with chromosomal 
deletion of 4q or 16q. HCC was epigenetically distinguished into four 
subclasses: normal-like methylation, global-hypomethylation (favorable 
prognosis), stem-like methylation (poor prognosis), and CpG island methylation. 
These methylation statuses were globally maintained through HCC progression. 
Collectively, these data show that as HCC progresses, additional molecular 
events exclusive of driver gene mutations cooperatively contribute to 
transcriptional activation of downstream targets according to methylation 
status.]]></TEXT>

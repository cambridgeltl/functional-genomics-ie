Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits variable symptom severity ranging 
from asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and 
the humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses 
in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or 
death exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, and high anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels. Although 
anti-RBD immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels generally correlated with neutralization 
titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a 
predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, 
patient sera were also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant 
D614G, suggesting cross-protection from reinfection by either strain. However, 
SARS-CoV-2 sera generally lacked cross-neutralization to a highly homologous 
pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, which has not yet crossed the species 
barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity 
on disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions 
to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.]]></TEXT>

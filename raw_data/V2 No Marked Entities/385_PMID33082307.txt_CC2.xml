promotes self-renewal.

The transcriptional regulator EVI1 has an essential role in early development 
and haematopoiesis. However, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) driven by aberrantly 
high EVI1 expression has very poor prognosis. To investigate the effects of 
post-translational modifications on EVI1 function, we carried out a mass 
spectrometry (MS) analysis of EVI1 in AML and detected dynamic phosphorylation 
at serine 436 (S436). Wild-type EVI1 (EVI1-WT) with S436 available for 
phosphorylation, but not non-phosphorylatable EVI1-S436A, conferred 
haematopoietic progenitor cell self-renewal and was associated with 
significantly higher organised transcriptional patterns. In silico modelling of 
EVI1-S436 phosphorylation showed reduced affinity to CtBP1, and CtBP1 showed 
reduced interaction with EVI1-WT compared with EVI1-S436A. The motif harbouring 
S436 is a target of CDK2 and CDK3 kinases, which interacted with EVI1-WT. The 
methyltransferase DNMT3A bound preferentially to EVI1-WT compared with 
EVI1-S436A, and a hypomethylated cell population associated by EVI1-WT 
expression in murine haematopoietic progenitors is not maintained with 
EVI1-S436A. These data point to EVI1-S436 phosphorylation directing functional 
protein interactions for haematopoietic self-renewal. Targeting EVI1-S436 
phosphorylation may be of therapeutic benefit when treating EVI1-driven 
leukaemia.]]></TEXT>

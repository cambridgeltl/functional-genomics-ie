TGF-β signaling.

TGF-β receptors phosphorylate SMAD2 and SMAD3 transcription factors, which then 
form heterotrimeric complexes with SMAD4 and cooperate with context-specific 
transcription factors to activate target genes. Here we provide biochemical and 
structural evidence showing that binding of SMAD2 to DNA depends on the 
conformation of the E3 insert, a structural element unique to SMAD2 and 
previously thought to render SMAD2 unable to bind DNA. Based on this finding, we 
further delineate TGF-β signal transduction by defining distinct roles for SMAD2 
and SMAD3 with the forkhead pioneer factor FOXH1 as a partner in the regulation 
of differentiation genes in mouse mesendoderm precursors. FOXH1 is prebound to 
target sites in these loci and recruits SMAD3 independently of TGF-β signals, 
whereas SMAD2 remains predominantly cytoplasmic in the basal state and set to 
bind SMAD4 and join SMAD3:FOXH1 at target promoters in response to Nodal TGF-β 
signals. The results support a model in which signal-independent binding of 
SMAD3 and FOXH1 prime mesendoderm differentiation gene promoters for activation, 
and signal-driven SMAD2:SMAD4 binds to promoters that are preloaded with 
SMAD3:FOXH1 to activate transcription.]]></TEXT>

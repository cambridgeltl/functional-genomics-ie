Host Defenses.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently 
identified coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease known as coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully 
understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we 
comprehensively define the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human 
RNAs. NSP16 binds to the mRNA recognition domains of the U1 and U2 splicing RNAs 
and acts to suppress global mRNA splicing upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. NSP1 binds 
to 18S ribosomal RNA in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome and leads to 
global inhibition of mRNA translation upon infection. Finally, NSP8 and NSP9 
bind to the 7SL RNA in the signal recognition particle and interfere with 
protein trafficking to the cell membrane upon infection. Disruption of each of 
these essential cellular functions acts to suppress the interferon response to 
viral infection. Our results uncover a multipronged strategy utilized by 
SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize essential cellular processes to suppress host defenses.]]></TEXT>

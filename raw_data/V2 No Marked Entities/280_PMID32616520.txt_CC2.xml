<TEXT><![CDATA[Identification of a localized nonsense-mediated decay pathway at the endoplasmic 
reticulum.

Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a translation-dependent RNA quality control 
mechanism that occurs in the cytoplasm. However, it is unknown how NMD regulates 
the stability of RNAs translated at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we 
identify a localized NMD pathway dedicated to ER-translated mRNAs. We previously 
identified NBAS, a component of the Syntaxin 18 complex involved in Golgi-to-ER 
trafficking, as a novel NMD factor. Furthermore, we show that NBAS fulfills an 
independent function in NMD. This ER-NMD pathway requires the interaction of 
NBAS with the core NMD factor UPF1, which is partially localized at the ER in 
the proximity of the translocon. NBAS and UPF1 coregulate the stability of 
ER-associated transcripts, in particular those associated with the cellular 
stress response. We propose a model where NBAS recruits UPF1 to the membrane of 
the ER and activates an ER-dedicated NMD pathway, thus providing an 
ER-protective function by ensuring quality control of ER-translated mRNAs.]]></TEXT>

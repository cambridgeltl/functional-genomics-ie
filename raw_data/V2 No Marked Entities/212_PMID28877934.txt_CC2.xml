<TEXT><![CDATA[Identification of senescent cell surface targetable protein DPP4.

Senescent cell accumulation in aging tissues is linked to age-associated 
diseases and declining function, prompting efforts to eliminate them. Mass 
spectrometry analysis revealed that DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4) was 
selectively expressed on the surface of senescent, but not proliferating, human 
diploid fibroblasts. Importantly, the differential presence of DPP4 allowed flow 
cytometry-mediated isolation of senescent cells using anti-DPP4 antibodies. 
Moreover, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays revealed 
that the cell surface DPP4 preferentially sensitized senescent, but not 
dividing, fibroblasts to cytotoxicity by natural killer cells. In sum, the 
selective expression of DPP4 on the surface of senescent cells enables their 
preferential elimination.]]></TEXT>

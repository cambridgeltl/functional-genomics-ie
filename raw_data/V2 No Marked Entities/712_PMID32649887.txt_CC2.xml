<TEXT><![CDATA[Immunogenomic Landscape of Hematological Malignancies.

Understanding factors that shape the immune landscape across hematological 
malignancies is essential for immunotherapy development. We integrated over 
8,000 transcriptomes and 2,000 samples with multilevel genomics of hematological 
cancers to investigate how immunological features are linked to cancer subtypes, 
genetic and epigenetic alterations, and patient survival, and validated key 
findings experimentally. Infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes was associated 
with TP53 and myelodysplasia-related changes in acute myeloid leukemia, and 
activated B cell-like phenotype and interferon-Î³ response in lymphoma. CIITA 
methylation regulating antigen presentation, cancer type-specific immune 
checkpoints, such as VISTA in myeloid malignancies, and variation in cancer 
antigen expression further contributed to immune heterogeneity and predicted 
survival. Our study provides a resource linking immunology with cancer subtypes 
and genomics in hematological malignancies.]]></TEXT>

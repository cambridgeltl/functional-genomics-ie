<TEXT><![CDATA[High-Spatial-Resolution Multi-Omics Sequencing via Deterministic Barcoding in 
Tissue.

We present deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing 
(DBiT-seq) for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue 
slide via next-generation sequencing (NGS). Parallel microfluidic channels were 
used to deliver DNA barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide, and crossflow of 
two sets of barcodes, A1-50 and B1-50, followed by ligation in situ, yielded a 
2D mosaic of tissue pixels, each containing a unique full barcode AB. 
Application to mouse embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis 
as well as fine features like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented 
epithelium in an eye field. Gene expression profiles in 10-Î¼m pixels conformed 
into the clusters of single-cell transcriptomes, allowing for rapid 
identification of cell types and spatial distributions. DBiT-seq can be adopted 
by researchers with no experience in microfluidics and may find applications in 
a range of fields including developmental biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, 
and clinical pathology.]]></TEXT>

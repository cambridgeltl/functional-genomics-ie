and Recurrent Features of Antibodies.

Neutralizing antibody responses to coronaviruses mainly target the 
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the trimeric spike. Here, we characterized 
polyclonal immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) and Fabs from COVID-19 convalescent 
individuals for recognition of coronavirus spikes. Plasma IgGs differed in their 
focus on RBD epitopes, recognition of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses, and 
contributions of avidity to increased binding/neutralization of IgGs over Fabs. 
Using electron microscopy, we examined specificities of polyclonal plasma Fabs, 
revealing recognition of both S1A and RBD epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 spike. 
Moreover, a 3.4 Å cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a neutralizing 
monoclonal Fab-spike complex revealed an epitope that blocks ACE2 receptor 
binding. Modeling based on these structures suggested different potentials for 
inter-spike crosslinking by IgGs on viruses, and characterized IgGs would not be 
affected by identified SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations. Overall, our studies 
structurally define a recurrent anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody class derived from 
VH3-53/VH3-66 and similarity to a SARS-CoV VH3-30 antibody, providing criteria 
for evaluating vaccine-elicited antibodies.]]></TEXT>

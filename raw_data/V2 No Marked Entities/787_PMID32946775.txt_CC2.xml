<TEXT><![CDATA[Single-Cell Characterization of Malignant Phenotypes and Developmental 
Trajectories of Adrenal Neuroblastoma.

Neuroblastoma (NB), which is a subtype of neural-crest-derived malignancy, is 
the most common extracranial solid tumor occurring in childhood. Despite 
extensive research, the underlying developmental origin of NB remains unclear. 
Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we generate transcriptomes of adrenal NB from 
160,910 cells of 16 patients and transcriptomes of putative developmental cells 
of origin of NB from 12,103 cells of early human embryos and fetal adrenal 
glands at relatively late development stages. We find that most adrenal NB tumor 
cells transcriptionally mirror noradrenergic chromaffin cells. Malignant states 
also recapitulate the proliferation/differentiation status of chromaffin cells 
in the process of normal development. Our findings provide insight into 
developmental trajectories and cellular states underlying human initiation and 
progression of NB.]]></TEXT>

cells.

Multiple sources contribute membrane and protein machineries to construct 
functional macroautophagic/autophagic structures. However, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that RAB2 connects the Golgi 
network to autophagy pathway by delivering membrane and by sequentially engaging 
distinct autophagy machineries. In unstressed cells, RAB2 resides primarily in 
the Golgi apparatus, as evidenced by its interaction and colocalization with 
GOLGA2/GM130. Importantly, autophagy stimuli dissociate RAB2 from GOLGA2 to 
interact with ULK1 complex, which facilitates the recruitment of ULK1 complex to 
form phagophores. Intriguingly, RAB2 appears to modulate ULK1 kinase activity to 
propagate signals for autophagosome formation. Subsequently, RAB2 switches to 
interact with autophagosomal RUBCNL/PACER and STX17 to further specify the 
recruitment of HOPS complex for autolysosome formation. Together, our study 
reveals a multivalent pathway in bulk autophagy regulation, and provides 
mechanistic insights into how the Golgi apparatus contributes to the formation 
of different autophagic structures.

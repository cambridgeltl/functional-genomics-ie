Antigen Presentation Pathway and Enables Immune Evasion in Cancer.

Loss of MHC class I (MHC-I) antigen presentation in cancer cells can elicit 
immunotherapy resistance. A genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen identified an 
evolutionarily conserved function of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that 
mediates coordinated transcriptional silencing of the MHC-I antigen processing 
pathway (MHC-I APP), promoting evasion of TÂ cell-mediated immunity. MHC-I APP 
gene promoters in MHC-I low cancers harbor bivalent activating H3K4me3 and 
repressive H3K27me3 histone modifications, silencing basal MHC-I expression and 
restricting cytokine-induced upregulation. Bivalent chromatin at MHC-I APP genes 
is a normal developmental process active in embryonic stem cells and maintained 
during neural progenitor differentiation. This physiological MHC-I silencing 
highlights a conserved mechanism by which cancers arising from these primitive 
tissues exploit PRC2 activity to enable immune evasion.]]></TEXT>

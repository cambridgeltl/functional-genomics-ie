Suv39/Clr4 activity and nucleosome stability.

Protection of euchromatin from invasion by gene-repressive heterochromatin is 
critical for cellular health and viability. In addition to constitutive loci 
such as pericentromeres and subtelomeres, heterochromatin can be found 
interspersed in gene-rich euchromatin, where it regulates gene expression 
pertinent to cell fate. While heterochromatin and euchromatin are globally 
poised for mutual antagonism, the mechanisms underlying precise spatial encoding 
of heterochromatin containment within euchromatic sites remain opaque. We 
investigated ectopic heterochromatin invasion by manipulating the fission yeast 
mating type locus boundary using a single-cell spreading reporter system. We 
found that heterochromatin repulsion is locally encoded by Set1/COMPASS on 
certain actively transcribed genes and that this protective role is most 
prominent at heterochromatin islands, small domains interspersed in euchromatin 
that regulate cell fate specifiers. Sensitivity to invasion by heterochromatin, 
surprisingly, is not dependent on Set1 altering overall gene expression levels. 
Rather, the gene-protective effect is strictly dependent on Set1's catalytic 
activity. H3K4 methylation, the Set1 product, antagonizes spreading in two ways: 
directly inhibiting catalysis by Suv39/Clr4 and locally disrupting nucleosome 
stability. Taken together, these results describe a mechanism for spatial 
encoding of euchromatic signals that repel heterochromatin invasion.]]></TEXT>

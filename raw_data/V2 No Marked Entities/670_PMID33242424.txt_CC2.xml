<TEXT><![CDATA[Integrated Proteogenomic Characterization across Major Histological Types of 
Pediatric Brain Cancer.

We report a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis, including whole-genome 
sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling, of 
218 tumors across 7 histological types of childhood brain cancer: low-grade 
glioma (nÂ = 93), ependymoma (32), high-grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), 
ganglioglioma (18), craniopharyngioma (16), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor 
(12). Proteomics data identify common biological themes that span histological 
boundaries, suggesting that treatments used for one histological type may be 
applied effectively to other tumors sharing similar proteomics features. Immune 
landscape characterization reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and 
within diagnoses. Proteomics data further reveal functional effects of somatic 
mutations and copy number variations (CNVs) not evident in transcriptomics data. 
Kinase-substrate association and co-expression network analysis identify 
important biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale 
proteogenomics analysis across traditional histological boundaries to uncover 
foundational pediatric brain tumor biology and inform rational treatment 
selection.]]></TEXT>

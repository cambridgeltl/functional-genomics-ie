synthesis inhibitors.

Aberrant translation initiation at non-AUG start codons is associated with 
multiple cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, how non-AUG 
translation may be regulated differently from canonical translation is poorly 
understood. Here, we used start codon-specific reporters and ribosome profiling 
to characterize how translation from non-AUG start codons responds to protein 
synthesis inhibitors in human cells. These analyses surprisingly revealed that 
translation of multiple non-AUG-encoded reporters and the endogenous GUG-encoded 
DAP5 (eIF4G2/p97) mRNA is resistant to cycloheximide (CHX), a translation 
inhibitor that severely slows but does not completely abrogate elongation. Our 
data suggest that slowly elongating ribosomes can lead to queuing/stacking of 
scanning preinitiation complexes (PICs), preferentially enhancing recognition of 
weak non-AUG start codons. Consistent with this model, limiting PIC formation or 
scanning sensitizes non-AUG translation to CHX. We further found that non-AUG 
translation is resistant to other inhibitors that target ribosomes within the 
coding sequence but not those targeting newly initiated ribosomes. Together, 
these data indicate that ribosome queuing enables mRNAs with poor initiation 
context-namely, those with non-AUG start codons-to be resistant to 
pharmacological translation inhibitors at concentrations that robustly inhibit 
global translation.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Tumor Cell Biodiversity Drives Microenvironmental Reprogramming in Liver Cancer.

Cellular diversity in tumors is a key factor for therapeutic failures and lethal 
outcomes of solid malignancies. Here, we determined the single-cell 
transcriptomic landscape of liver cancer biospecimens from 19 patients. We found 
varying degrees of heterogeneity in malignant cells within and between tumors 
and diverse landscapes of tumor microenvironment (TME). Strikingly, tumors with 
higher transcriptomic diversity were associated with patient's worse overall 
survival. We found a link between hypoxia-dependent vascular endothelial growth 
factor expression in tumor diversity and TME polarization. Moreover, TÂ cells 
from higher heterogeneous tumors showed lower cytolytic activities. Consistent 
results were found using bulk genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 765 liver 
tumors. Our results offer insight into the diverse ecosystem of liver cancer and 
its impact on patient prognosis.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Genomic and Transcriptomic Characterization of Natural Killer T Cell Lymphoma.

Natural killer/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is an aggressive and heterogeneous entity 
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
infection. To identify molecular subtypes of NKTCL based on genomic structural 
alterations and EBV sequences, we performed multi-omics study on 128 biopsy 
samples of newly diagnosed NKTCL and defined three prominent subtypes, which 
differ significantly in cell of origin, EBV gene expression, transcriptional 
signatures, and responses to asparaginase-based regimens and targeted therapy. 
Our findings thus identify molecular networks of EBV-associated pathogenesis and 
suggest potential clinical strategies on NKTCL.]]></TEXT>

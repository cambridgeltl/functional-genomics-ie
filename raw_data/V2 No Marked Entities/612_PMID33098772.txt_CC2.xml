<TEXT><![CDATA[Chromatin Potential Identified by Shared Single-Cell Profiling of RNA and 
Chromatin.

Cell differentiation and function are regulated across multiple layers of gene 
regulation, including modulation of gene expression by changes in chromatin 
accessibility. However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a 
temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. 
Here we developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with 
sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin 
accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to 
different tissues. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a 
computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define 
domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with 
super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs 
precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may 
prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential 
as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict 
cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory 
circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.]]></TEXT>

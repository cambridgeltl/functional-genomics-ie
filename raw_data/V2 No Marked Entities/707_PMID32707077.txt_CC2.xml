<TEXT><![CDATA[Emergence of a High-Plasticity Cell State during Lung Cancer Evolution.

Tumor evolution from a single cell into a malignant, heterogeneous tissue 
remains poorly understood. Here, we profile single-cell transcriptomes of 
genetically engineered mouse lung tumors at seven stages, from pre-neoplastic 
hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma. The diversity of transcriptional states increases 
over time and is reproducible across tumors and mice. Cancer cells progressively 
adopt alternate lineage identities, computationally predicted to be mediated 
through a common transitional, high-plasticity cell state (HPCS). Accordingly, 
HPCS cells prospectively isolated from mouse tumors and human patient-derived 
xenografts display high capacity for differentiation and proliferation. The HPCS 
program is associated with poor survival across human cancers and demonstrates 
chemoresistance in mice. Our study reveals a central principle underpinning 
intra-tumoral heterogeneity and motivates therapeutic targeting of the HPCS.]]></TEXT>

Networks.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed the lives of over 
one million people worldwide. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of the Coronaviridae family of 
viruses that can cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular 
host factors and pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus 
life cycles remain ill defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale 
CRISPR knockout screens during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal 
coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered 
host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional 
roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol 
regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling, bone morphogenetic protein 
(BMP) signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a 
requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute 
requirement for the VMP1, TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein 
transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three 
seasonal coronaviruses. This human coronavirus host factor compendium represents 
a rich resource to develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and 
potential future coronavirus pandemics.]]></TEXT>

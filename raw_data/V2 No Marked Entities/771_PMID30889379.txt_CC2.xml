<TEXT><![CDATA[The Proteogenomic Landscape of Curable Prostate Cancer.

DNA sequencing has identified recurrent mutations that drive the aggressiveness 
of prostate cancers. Surprisingly, the influence of genomic, epigenomic, and 
transcriptomic dysregulation on the tumor proteome remains poorly understood. We 
profiled the genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes of 76 localized, 
intermediate-risk prostate cancers. We discovered that the genomic subtypes of 
prostate cancer converge on five proteomic subtypes, with distinct clinical 
trajectories. ETS fusions, the most common alteration in prostate tumors, affect 
different genes and pathways in the proteome and transcriptome. Globally, mRNA 
abundance changes explain only âˆ¼10% of protein abundance variability. As a 
result, prognostic biomarkers combining genomic or epigenomic features with 
proteomic ones significantly outperform biomarkers comprised of a single data 
type.]]></TEXT>

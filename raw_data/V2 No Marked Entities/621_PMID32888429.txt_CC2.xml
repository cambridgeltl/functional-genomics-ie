<TEXT><![CDATA[The Human and Mouse Enteric Nervous System at Single-Cell Resolution.

The enteric nervous system (ENS) coordinates diverse functions in the intestine 
but has eluded comprehensive molecular characterization because of the rarity 
and diversity of cells. Here we develop two methods to profile the ENS of adult 
mice and humans at single-cell resolution: RAISIN RNA-seq for profiling intact 
nuclei with ribosome-bound mRNA and MIRACL-seq for label-free enrichment of rare 
cell types by droplet-based profiling. The 1,187,535 nuclei in our mouse atlas 
include 5,068 neurons from the ileum and colon, revealing extraordinary neuron 
diversity. We highlight circadian expression changes in enteric neurons, show 
that disease-related genes are dysregulated with aging, and identify differences 
between the ileum and proximal/distal colon. In humans, we profile 436,202 
nuclei, recovering 1,445 neurons, and identify conserved and species-specific 
transcriptional programs and putative neuro-epithelial, neuro-stromal, and 
neuro-immune interactions. The human ENS expresses risk genes for neuropathic, 
inflammatory, and extra-intestinal diseases, suggesting neuronal contributions 
to disease.]]></TEXT>

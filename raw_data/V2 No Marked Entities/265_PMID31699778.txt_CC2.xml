is driven by Cezanne.

The establishment of polyubiquitin conjugates with distinct linkages play 
important roles in the DNA damage response. Much remains unknown about the 
regulation of linkage-specific ubiquitin signaling at sites of DNA damage. Here 
we reveal that Cezanne (also known as Otud7B) deubiquitinating enzyme promotes 
the recruitment of Rap80/BRCA1-A complex by binding to Lys63-polyubiquitin and 
targeting Lys11-polyubiquitin. Using a ubiquitin binding domain protein array 
screen, we identify that the UBA domains of Cezanne and Cezanne2 (also known as 
Otud7A) selectively bind to Lys63-linked polyubiquitin. Increased Lys11-linkage 
ubiquitination due to lack of Cezanne DUB activity compromises the recruitment 
of Rap80/BRCA1-A. Cezanne2 interacts with Cezanne, facilitating Cezanne in the 
recruitment of Rap80/BRCA1-A, Rad18, and 53BP1, in cellular resistance to 
ionizing radiation and DNA repair. Our work presents a model that Cezanne serves 
as a "reader" of the Lys63-linkage polyubiquitin at DNA damage sites and an 
"eraser" of the Lys11-linkage ubiquitination, indicating a crosstalk between 
linkage-specific ubiquitination at DNA damage sites.

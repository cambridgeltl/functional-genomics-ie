Puncta intended: connecting the dots between autophagy and cell stress networks.

Proteome profiling and global protein-interaction approaches have significantly 
improved our knowledge of the protein interactomes of autophagy and other 
cellular stress-response pathways. New discoveries regarding protein complexes, 
interaction partners, interaction domains, and biological roles of players that 
are part of these pathways are emerging. The fourth Vancouver Autophagy 
Symposium showcased research that expands our understanding of the protein 
interaction networks and molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy and other 
cellular stress responses in the context of distinct stressors. In the keynote 
presentation, Dr. Wade Harper described his team's recent discovery of a novel 
reticulophagy receptor for selective autophagic degradation of the endoplasmic 
reticulum, and discussed molecular mechanisms involved in ribophagy and 
non-autophagic ribosomal turnover. In other presentations, both omic and 
targeted approaches were used to reveal molecular players of other cellular 
stress responses including amyloid body and stress granule formation, anastasis, 
and extracellular vesicle biogenesis. Additional topics included the roles of 
autophagy in disease pathogenesis, autophagy regulatory mechanisms, and 
crosstalk between autophagy and cellular metabolism in anti-tumor immunity. The 
relationship between autophagy and other cell stress responses remains a 
relatively unexplored area in the field, with future investigations required to 
understand how the various processes are coordinated and connected in cells and 
tissues.]]></TEXT>

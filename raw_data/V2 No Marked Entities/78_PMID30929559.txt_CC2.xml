leukemia.

Imatinib is the first molecularly targeted compound for chronic myeloid leukemia 
(CML) capable to inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity. However, recent clinical 
evidence indicates that a substantial proportion of CML patients exhibit 
BCR-ABL-dependent or independent resistance to imatinib. Despite the importance 
of imatinib resistance in CML, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this 
resistance are largely unknown. Here, we identified GCA (grancalcin) as a 
critical regulator of imatinib resistance in chronic phase CML via activation of 
autophagy. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that GCA activates TRAF6 ubiquitin 
ligase activity to induce Lys63 ubiquitination of ULK1, a crucial regulator of 
autophagy, resulting in its stabilization and activation. We also highlighted 
the role of GCA-TRAF6-ULK1 autophagy regulatory axis in imatinib resistance. Our 
findings represent the basis for novel therapeutic strategies against 
CML.]]></TEXT>

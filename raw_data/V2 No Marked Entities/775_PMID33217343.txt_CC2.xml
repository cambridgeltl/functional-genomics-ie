<TEXT><![CDATA[Molecular Features of Cancers Exhibiting Exceptional Responses to Treatment.

A small fraction of cancer patients with advanced disease survive significantly 
longer than patients with clinically comparable tumors. Molecular mechanisms for 
exceptional responses to therapy have been identified by genomic analysis of 
tumor biopsies from individual patients. Here, we analyzed tumor biopsies from 
an unbiased cohort of 111 exceptional responder patients using multiple 
platforms to profile genetic and epigenetic aberrations as well as the tumor 
microenvironment. Integrative analysis uncovered plausible mechanisms for the 
therapeutic response in nearly a quarter of the patients. The mechanisms were 
assigned to four broad categories-DNA damage response, intracellular signaling, 
immune engagement, and genetic alterations characteristic of favorable 
prognosis-with many tumors falling into multiple categories. These analyses 
revealed synthetic lethal relationships that may be exploited therapeutically 
and rare genetic lesions that favor therapeutic success, while also providing a 
wealth of testable hypotheses regarding oncogenic mechanisms that may influence 
the response to cancer therapy.]]></TEXT>

target underlying the quality control of multiple organelles.

The structural integrity and functional stability of organelles are 
prerequisites for the viability and responsiveness of cells. Dysfunction of 
multiple organelles is critically involved in the pathogenesis and progression 
of various diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
cardiovascular diseases, infection, and neurodegenerative diseases. In fact, 
those organelles synchronously present with evident structural derangement and 
aberrant function under exposure to different stimuli, which might accelerate 
the corruption of cells. Therefore, the quality control of multiple organelles 
is of great importance in maintaining the survival and function of cells and 
could be a potential therapeutic target for human diseases. Organelle-specific 
autophagy is one of the major subtypes of autophagy, selectively targeting 
different organelles for quality control. This type of autophagy includes 
mitophagy, pexophagy, reticulophagy (endoplasmic reticulum), ribophagy, 
lysophagy, and nucleophagy. These kinds of organelle-specific autophagy are 
reported to be beneficial for inflammatory disorders by eliminating damaged 
organelles and maintaining homeostasis. In this review, we summarized the recent 
findings and mechanisms covering different kinds of organelle-specific 
autophagy, as well as their involvement in various diseases, aiming to arouse 
concern about the significance of the quality control of multiple organelles in 
the treatment of inflammatory diseases.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[The PD-1/PD-L1-Checkpoint Restrains T cell Immunity in Tumor-Draining Lymph 
Nodes.

PD-1/PD-L1-checkpoint blockade therapy is generally thought to relieve tumor 
cell-mediated suppression in the tumor microenvironment but PD-L1 is also 
expressed on non-tumor macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs). Here 
we show in mouse tumor models that tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are 
enriched for tumor-specific PD-1+ T cells which closely associate with PD-L1+ 
cDCs. TDLN-targeted PD-L1-blockade induces enhanced anti-tumor T cell immunity 
by seeding the tumor site with progenitor-exhausted T cells, resulting in 
improved tumor control. Moreover, we show that abundant PD-1/PD-L1-interactions 
in TDLNs of nonmetastatic melanoma patients, but not those in corresponding 
tumors, associate with early distant disease recurrence. These findings point at 
a critical role for PD-L1 expression in TDLNs in governing systemic anti-tumor 
immunity, identifying high-risk patient groups amendable to adjuvant 
PD-1/PD-L1-blockade therapy.]]></TEXT>

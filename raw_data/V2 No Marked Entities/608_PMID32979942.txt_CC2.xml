<TEXT><![CDATA[Molecular Architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite 
recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the 
detailed architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report 
the molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryoelectron 
tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S 
proteins in pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average 
resolutions of 8.7-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native 
spikes were analyzed by mass spectrometry, which revealed overall processing 
states of the native glycans highly similar to that of the recombinant 
glycoprotein glycans. The native conformation of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) 
and their higher-order assemblies were revealed. Overall, these 
characterizations revealed the architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in 
exceptional detail and shed light on how the virus packs its ∼30-kb-long 
single-segmented RNA in the ∼80-nm-diameter lumen.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[The Immunology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children with COVID-19.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is 
typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the 
rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with 
COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction, 
and strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but 
has overlapping features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a 
likely autoimmune etiology. We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune 
cells, cytokines, and autoantibodies in healthy children, children with Kawasaki 
disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 
children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the inflammatory response in MIS-C 
differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19, shares several 
features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with 
respect to T cell subsets, interleukin (IL)-17A, and biomarkers associated with 
arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple 
autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.]]></TEXT>

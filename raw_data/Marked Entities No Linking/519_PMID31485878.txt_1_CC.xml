mellitus.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is caused by pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and 
apoptosis, with consequent severe insulin deficiency. Thus, β-cell protection 
may be a primary target in the treatment of T1DM. Evidence has demonstrated that 
defective mitochondrial function plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell 
dysfunction and apoptosis; however, the fundamental effect of mitochondrial 
complex I action on β-cells and T1DM remains unclear. In the current study, the 
pancreas protective effect of complex I inhibitor rotenone (ROT) and its 
potential mechanism were assessed in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model 
of T1DM and in cultured mouse pancreatic β-cell line, Min6. ROT treatment 
exerted a hypoglycemic effect, restored the insulin level, and decreased 
inflammation and cell apoptosis in the pancreas. In vitro experiments also 
showed that ROT decreased STZ- and inflammatory cytokines-induced β-cell 
apoptosis. These protective effects were accompanied by attenuation of reactive 
oxygen species, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of 
transcriptional coactivator PPARα coactivator 1α (PGC-1α)-controlled 
mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings suggest that mitochondrial complex I 
inhibition may represent a promising strategy for β-cell protection in T1DM.

<TEXT><![CDATA[Targeting Mitochondria-Located circRNA SCAR Alleviates NASH via Reducing mROS 
Output.

Mitochondria, which play central roles in immunometabolic diseases, have their 
own genome. However, the functions of mitochondria-located noncoding RNAs are 
largely unknown due to the absence of a specific delivery system. By circular 
RNA (circRNA) expression profile analysis of liver fibroblasts from patients 
with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we observe that mitochondrial circRNAs 
account for a considerable fraction of downregulated circRNAs in NASH 
fibroblasts. By constructing mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles, we observe 
that Steatohepatitis-associated circRNA ATP5B Regulator (SCAR), which is located 
in mitochondria, inhibits mitochondrial ROS (mROS) output and fibroblast 
activation. circRNA SCAR, mediated by PGC-1α, binds to ATP5B and shuts down mPTP 
by blocking CypD-mPTP interaction. Lipid overload inhibits PGC-1α by endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress-induced CHOP. In vivo, targeting circRNA SCAR alleviates 
high fat diet-induced cirrhosis and insulin resistance. Clinically, circRNA SCAR 
is associated with steatosis-to-NASH progression. Collectively, we identify a 
mitochondrial circRNA that drives metaflammation and serves as a therapeutic 
target for NASH.

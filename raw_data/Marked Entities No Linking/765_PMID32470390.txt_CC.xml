<TEXT><![CDATA[Extensive Remodeling of the Immune Microenvironment in B Cell Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia.

A subset of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients will relapse 
and succumb to therapy-resistant disease. The bone marrow microenvironment may 
support B-ALL progression and treatment evasion. Utilizing single-cell 
approaches, we demonstrate B-ALL bone marrow immune microenvironment remodeling 
upon disease initiation and subsequent re-emergence during conventional 
chemotherapy. We uncover a role for non-classical monocytes in B-ALL survival, 
and demonstrate monocyte abundance at B-ALL diagnosis is predictive of pediatric 
and adult B-ALL patient survival. We show that human B-ALL blasts alter a 
vascularized microenvironment promoting monocytic differentiation, while 
depleting leukemia-associated monocytes in B-ALL animal models prolongs disease 
remission in vivo. Our profiling of the B-ALL immune microenvironment identifies 
extrinsic regulators of B-ALL survival supporting new immune-based therapeutic 
approaches for high-risk B-ALL treatment.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Oxidative Metabolism Drives Immortalization of Neural Stem Cells during 
Tumorigenesis.

Metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of many cancers, but how and when it 
contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that metabolic 
reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for 
immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible 
dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that 
Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined 
by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted 
metabolomics and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is 
required for tumor cell immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells 
(NSCs) giving rise to tumors. Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD+ sensor, we show 
that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or 
mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis 
through impaired NAD+ regeneration. Our work establishes a unique connection 
between cellular metabolism and immortalization of tumor-initiating cells.]]></TEXT>

Small Cell Lung Cancer.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is a central regulator of the cell cycle and 
gene transcription. However, little is known about its impact on genomic 
instability and cancer immunity. Using a selective CDK7 inhibitor, YKL-5-124, we 
demonstrated that CDK7 inhibition predominately disrupts cell-cycle progression 
and induces DNA replication stress and genome instability in small cell lung 
cancer (SCLC) while simultaneously triggering immune-response signaling. These 
tumor-intrinsic events provoke a robust immune surveillance program elicited by 
TÂ cells, which is further enhanced by the addition of immune-checkpoint 
blockade. Combining YKL-5-124 with anti-PD-1 offers significant survival benefit 
in multiple highly aggressive murine models of SCLC, providing a rationale for 
new combination regimens consisting of CDK7 inhibitors and immunotherapies.]]></TEXT>

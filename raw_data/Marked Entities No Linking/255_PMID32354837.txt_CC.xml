Human 4E-T is an eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) present in processing (P)-bodies 
that represses translation and regulates decay of mRNAs destabilized by AU-rich 
elements and microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms 
are still unclear. Here, we show that upon mRNA binding 4E-T represses 
translation and promotes deadenylation via the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT 
deadenylase complex. The interaction with CCR4-NOT is mediated by previously 
uncharacterized sites in the middle region of 4E-T. Importantly, mRNA decapping 
and decay are inhibited by 4E-T and the deadenylated target is stored in a 
repressed form. Inhibition of mRNA decapping requires the interaction of 4E-T 
with the cap-binding proteins eIF4E/4EHP. We further show that regulation of 
decapping by 4E-T participates in mRNA repression by the miRNA effector protein 
TNRC6B and that 4E-T overexpression interferes with tristetraprolin (TTP)- and 
NOT1-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, we postulate that 4E-T modulates 5'-to-3' decay 
by swapping the fate of a deadenylated mRNA from complete degradation to 
storage. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of mRNA storage that 
controls localized translation and mRNA stability in P-bodies.]]></TEXT>

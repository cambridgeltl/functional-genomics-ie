<TEXT><![CDATA[Critical roles of phosphoinositides and NF2 in Hippo pathway regulation.

The Hippo pathway is a master regulator of tissue homeostasis and organ size. 
NF2 is a well-established tumor suppressor, and loss of NF2 severely compromises 
Hippo pathway activity. However, the precise mechanism of how NF2 mediates 
upstream signals to regulate the Hippo pathway is not clear. Here we report 
that, in mammalian cells, NF2's lipid-binding ability is critical for its 
function in activating the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress. 
Mechanistically, osmotic stress induces PI(4,5)P2 plasma membrane enrichment by 
activating the PIP5K family, allowing for NF2 plasma membrane recruitment and 
subsequent downstream Hippo pathway activation. An NF2 mutant deficient in lipid 
binding is unable to activate the Hippo pathway in response to osmotic stress, 
as measured by LATS and YAP phosphorylation. Our findings identify the PIP5K 
family as novel regulators upstream of Hippo signaling, and uncover the 
importance of phosphoinositide dynamics, specifically PI(4,5)P2, in Hippo 
pathway regulation.

<TEXT><![CDATA[Mitochondrial ClpP-Mediated Proteolysis Induces Selective Cancer Cell Lethality.

The mitochondrial caseinolytic protease P (ClpP) plays a central role in 
mitochondrial protein quality control by degrading misfolded proteins. Using 
genetic and chemical approaches, we showed that hyperactivation of the protease 
selectively kills cancer cells, independently of p53 status, by selective 
degradation of its respiratory chain protein substrates and disrupts 
mitochondrial structure and function, while it does not affect non-malignant 
cells. We identified imipridones as potent activators of ClpP. Through 
biochemical studies and crystallography, we show that imipridones bind ClpP 
non-covalently and induce proteolysis by diverse structural changes. Imipridones 
are presently in clinical trials. Our findings suggest a general concept of 
inducing cancer cell lethality through activation of mitochondrial proteolysis.]]></TEXT>

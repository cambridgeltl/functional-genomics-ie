<TEXT><![CDATA[Targeted chemotherapy overcomes drug resistance in melanoma.

The emergence of drug resistance is a major obstacle for the success of targeted 
therapy in melanoma. Additionally, conventional chemotherapy has not been 
effective as drug-resistant cells escape lethal DNA damage effects by inducing 
growth arrest commonly referred to as cellular dormancy. We present a 
therapeutic strategy termed "targeted chemotherapy" by depleting protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or its inhibition using a small molecule inhibitor 
(1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione [phendione]) in drug-resistant melanoma. Targeted 
chemotherapy induces the DNA damage response without causing DNA breaks or 
allowing cellular dormancy. Phendione treatment reduces tumor growth of 
BRAFV600E-driven melanoma patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and diminishes growth 
of NRASQ61R-driven melanoma, a cancer with no effective therapy. Remarkably, 
phendione treatment inhibits the acquisition of resistance to BRAF inhibition in 
BRAFV600E PDX highlighting its effectiveness in combating the advent of drug 
resistance.

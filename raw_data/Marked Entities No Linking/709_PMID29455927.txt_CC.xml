<TEXT><![CDATA[Fibroblast Heterogeneity and Immunosuppressive Environment in Human Breast 
Cancer.

Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are key players in the tumor 
microenvironment. Here, we characterize four CAF subsets in breast cancer with 
distinct properties and levels of activation. Two myofibroblastic subsets 
(CAF-S1, CAF-S4) accumulate differentially in triple-negative breast cancers 
(TNBC). CAF-S1 fibroblasts promote an immunosuppressive environment through a 
multi-step mechanism. By secreting CXCL12, CAF-S1 attracts CD4+CD25+ T 
lymphocytes and retains them by OX40L, PD-L2, and JAM2. Moreover, CAF-S1 
increases T lymphocyte survival and promotes their differentiation into 
CD25HighFOXP3High, through B7H3, CD73, and DPP4. Finally, in contrast to CAF-S4, 
CAF-S1 enhances the regulatory T cell capacity to inhibit T effector 
proliferation. These data are consistent with FOXP3+ T lymphocyte accumulation 
in CAF-S1-enriched TNBC and show how a CAF subset contributes to 
immunosuppression.]]></TEXT>

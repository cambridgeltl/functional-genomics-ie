<TEXT><![CDATA[The Daam2-VHL-Nedd4 axis governs developmental and regenerative oligodendrocyte 
differentiation.

Dysregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system (UPS) enables pathogenic 
accumulation of disease-driving proteins in neurons across a host of 
neurological disorders. However, whether and how the UPS contributes to 
oligodendrocyte dysfunction and repair after white matter injury (WMI) remains 
undefined. Here we show that the E3 ligase VHL interacts with Daam2 and their 
mutual antagonism regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation during development. 
Using proteomic analysis of the Daam2-VHL complex coupled with conditional 
genetic knockout mouse models, we further discovered that the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase Nedd4 is required for developmental myelination through stabilization of 
VHL via K63-linked ubiquitination. Furthermore, studies in mouse demyelination 
models and white matter lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis 
corroborate the function of this pathway during remyelination after WMI. 
Overall, these studies provide evidence that a signaling axis involving key UPS 
components contributes to oligodendrocyte development and repair and reveal a 
new role for Nedd4 in glial biology.]]></TEXT>

NF-κB and Hedgehog pathways in LPS-induced acute lung injury.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a pulmonary disorder, which can result in fibrosis of 
the lung tissues. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has become a novel 
therapeutic method for ALI. However, the potential mechanism by which MSC 
regulates the progression of ALI remains blurry. The present study focused on 
investigating the mechanism underneath MSC-reversed lung injury and fibrosis. At 
first, we determined that coculture with MSC led to the inactivation of NF-κB 
signaling and therefore suppressed hedgehog pathway in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells. 
Besides, we confirmed that MSC-exosomes were responsible for the inhibition of 
EMT process in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells through transmitting miRNAs. Mechanism 
investigation revealed that MSC-exosome transmitted miR-182-5p and miR-23a-3p 
into LPS-treated MLE-12 cells to, respectively, target Ikbkb and Usp5. Of note, 
Usp5 interacted with IKKβ to hamper IKKβ ubiquitination. Moreover, co-inhibition 
of miR-182-5p and miR-23a-3p offset the suppression of MSC on EMT process in 
LPS-treated MLE-12 cells as well as in LPS-injured lungs of mice. Besides, the 
retarding effect of MSC on p65 nuclear translocation was also counteracted after 
co-inhibiting miR-182-5p and miR-23a-3p, both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, 
MSC-exosome transmitted miR-23a-3p and miR-182-5p reversed the progression of 
LPS-induced lung injury and fibrosis through inhibiting NF-κB and hedgehog 
pathways via silencing Ikbkb and destabilizing IKKβ.]]></TEXT>

Cancer.

Despite the development of second-generation antiandrogens, acquired resistance 
to hormone therapy remains a major challenge in treating advanced prostate 
cancer. We find that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote 
antiandrogen resistance in mouse models and in prostate organoid cultures. We 
identify neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in CAF supernatant, which promotes resistance in 
tumor cells through activation of HER3. Pharmacological blockade of the 
NRG1/HER3 axis using clinical-grade blocking antibodies re-sensitizes tumors to 
hormone deprivation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, patients with 
castration-resistant prostate cancer with increased tumor NRG1 activity have an 
inferior response to second-generation antiandrogen therapy. This work reveals a 
paracrine mechanism of antiandrogen resistance in prostate cancer amenable to 
clinical testing using available targeted therapies.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[PPARγ is a nexus controlling alternative activation of macrophages via glutamine 
metabolism.


The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is 
known to regulate lipid metabolism in many tissues, including macrophages. Here 
we report that peritoneal macrophage respiration is enhanced by rosiglitazone, 
an activating PPARγ ligand, in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Moreover, PPARγ is 
required for macrophage respiration even in the absence of exogenous ligand. 
Unexpectedly, the absence of PPARγ dramatically affects the oxidation of 
glutamine. Both glutamine and PPARγ have been implicated in alternative 
activation (AA) of macrophages, and PPARγ was required for interleukin 4 
(IL4)-dependent gene expression and stimulation of macrophage respiration. 
Indeed, unstimulated macrophages lacking PPARγ contained elevated levels of the 
inflammation-associated metabolite itaconate and express a proinflammatory 
transcriptome that, remarkably, phenocopied that of macrophages depleted of 
glutamine. Thus, PPARγ functions as a checkpoint, guarding against inflammation, 
and is permissive for AA by facilitating glutamine metabolism. However, PPARγ 
expression is itself markedly increased by IL4. This suggests that PPARγ 
functions at the center of a feed-forward loop that is central to AA of 
macrophages.]]></TEXT>

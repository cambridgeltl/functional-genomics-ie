<TEXT><![CDATA[Obesity Shapes Metabolism in the Tumor Microenvironment to Suppress Anti-Tumor 
Immunity.

Obesity is a major cancer risk factor, but how differences in systemic 
metabolism change the tumor microenvironment (TME) and impact anti-tumor 
immunity is not understood. Here, we demonstrate that high-fat diet 
(HFD)-induced obesity impairs CD8+ T cell function in the murine TME, 
accelerating tumor growth. We generate a single-cell resolution atlas of 
cellular metabolism in the TME, detailing how it changes with diet-induced 
obesity. We find that tumor and CD8+ T cells display distinct metabolic 
adaptations to obesity. Tumor cells increase fat uptake with HFD, whereas 
tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells do not. These differential adaptations lead to 
altered fatty acid partitioning in HFD tumors, impairing CD8+ T cell 
infiltration and function. Blocking metabolic reprogramming by tumor cells in 
obese mice improves anti-tumor immunity. Analysis of human cancers reveals 
similar transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cell markers, suggesting interventions 
that exploit metabolism to improve cancer immunotherapy.]]></TEXT>

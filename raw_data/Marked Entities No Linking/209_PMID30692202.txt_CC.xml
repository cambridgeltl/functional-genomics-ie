<TEXT><![CDATA[CD44 splice isoform switching determines breast cancer stem cell state.

lthough changes in alternative splicing have been observed in cancer, their 
functional contributions still remain largely unclear. Here we report that 
splice isoforms of the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker CD44 exhibit strikingly 
opposite functions in breast cancer. Bioinformatic annotation in patient breast 
cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database reveals that the CD44 standard 
splice isoform (CD44s) positively associates with the CSC gene signatures, 
whereas the CD44 variant splice isoforms (CD44v) exhibit an inverse association. 
We show that CD44s is the predominant isoform expressed in breast CSCs. 
Elimination of the CD44s isoform impairs CSC traits. Conversely, manipulating 
the splicing regulator ESRP1 to shift alternative splicing from CD44v to CD44s 
leads to an induction of CSC properties. We further demonstrate that CD44s 
activates the PDGFRÎ²/Stat3 cascade to promote CSC traits. These results reveal 
CD44 isoform specificity in CSC and non-CSC states and suggest that alternative 
splicing provides functional gene versatility that is essential for distinct 
cancer cell states and thus cancer phenotypes.

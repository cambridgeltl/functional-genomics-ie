<TEXT><![CDATA[Cerebral organoid and mouse models reveal a RAB39b-PI3K-mTOR pathway-dependent 
dysregulation of cortical development leading to macrocephaly/autism phenotypes.

Dysregulation of early neurodevelopment is implicated in macrocephaly/autism 
disorders. However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in 
human cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene 
RAB39b are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain 
remain unknown. We generated Rab39b knockout (KO) mice and found that they 
exhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD 
behaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human 
cerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation 
and impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble 
neurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b 
interacts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling 
in NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly 
enhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely 
detectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling 
rescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by RAB39b 
mutations. Therefore, RAB39b mutation promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity and alters 
cortical neurogenesis, leading to macrocephaly and autistic-like behaviors. Our 
studies provide new insights into neurodevelopmental dysregulation and common 
pathways associated with ASD across species.]]></TEXT>

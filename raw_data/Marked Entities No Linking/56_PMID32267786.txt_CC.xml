<TEXT><![CDATA[Autophagy suppresses breast cancer metastasis by degrading NBR1.

Macroautophagy/autophagy plays complex, context-dependent roles in cancer. How 
autophagy governs the emergence of metastatic disease has been incompletely 
understood. We recently uncovered that genetic autophagy inhibition strongly 
attenuates primary tumor growth in mammary cancer models, yet paradoxically 
promotes spontaneous metastasis to the lung and enables the outgrowth of 
disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) into overt macro-metastases. Furthermore, at 
both primary and metastatic sites, genetic autophagy inhibition leads to the 
marked expansion of tumor cells exhibiting aggressive and pro-metastatic basal 
epithelial differentiation. These pro-metastatic effects of autophagy inhibition 
are due to the cytosolic accumulation of the autophagy cargo receptor NBR1 in 
autophagy-deficient tumor cells.]]></TEXT>

R-loop suppression pathways involved in genome integrity.

Bromodomain proteins (BRD) are key chromatin regulators of genome function and 
stability as well as therapeutic targets in cancer. Here, we systematically 
delineate the contribution of human BRD proteins for genome stability and DNA 
double-strand break (DSB) repair using several cell-based assays and proteomic 
interaction network analysis. Applying these approaches, we identify 24 of the 
42 BRD proteins as promoters of DNA repair and/or genome integrity. We 
identified a BRD-reader function of PCAF that bound TIP60-mediated histone 
acetylations at DSBs to recruit a DUB complex to deubiquitylate histone H2BK120, 
to allowing direct acetylation by PCAF, and repair of DSBs by homologous 
recombination. We also discovered the bromo-and-extra-terminal (BET) BRD 
proteins, BRD2 and BRD4, as negative regulators of transcription-associated 
RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) as inhibition of BRD2 or BRD4 increased R-loop 
formation, which generated DSBs. These breaks were reliant on topoisomerase II, 
and BRD2 directly bound and activated topoisomerase I, a known restrainer of 
R-loops. Thus, comprehensive interactome and functional profiling of BRD 
proteins revealed new homologous recombination and genome stability pathways, 
providing a framework to understand genome maintenance by BRD proteins and the 
effects of their pharmacological inhibition.

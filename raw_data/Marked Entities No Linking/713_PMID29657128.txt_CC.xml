Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.

Combination immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated promising benefit in 
lung cancer, but predictors of response to combination therapy are unknown. 
Using whole-exome sequencing to examine non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
treated with PD-1 plus CTLA-4 blockade, we found that high tumor mutation burden 
(TMB) predicted improved objective response, durable benefit, and 
progression-free survival. TMB was independent of PD-L1 expression and the 
strongest feature associated with efficacy in multivariable analysis. The low 
response rate in TMB low NSCLCs demonstrates that combination immunotherapy does 
not overcome the negative predictive impact of low TMB. This study demonstrates 
the association between TMB and benefit to combination immunotherapy in NSCLC. 
TMB should be incorporated in future trials examining PD-(L)1 with CTLA-4 
blockade in NSCLC.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[BRG1 Loss Predisposes Lung Cancers to Replicative Stress and ATR Dependency.

Inactivation of SMARCA4/BRG1, the core ATPase subunit of mammalian SWI/SNF 
complexes, occurs at very high frequencies in non-small cell lung cancers 
(NSCLC). There are no targeted therapies for this subset of lung cancers, nor is 
it known how mutations in BRG1 contribute to lung cancer progression. Using a 
combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that 
deletion of BRG1 in lung cancer leads to activation of replication stress 
responses. Single-molecule assessment of replication fork dynamics in 
BRG1-deficient cells revealed increased origin firing mediated by the 
prelicensing protein, CDC6. Quantitative mass spectrometry and 
coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complexes 
interact with RPA complexes. Finally, BRG1-deficient lung cancers were sensitive 
to pharmacologic inhibition of ATR. These findings provide novel mechanistic 
insight into BRG1-mutant lung cancers and suggest that their dependency on ATR 
can be leveraged therapeutically and potentially expanded to BRG1-mutant cancers 
in other tissues. ]]></TEXT>

T-cell response and may predict fatal COVID-19 outcome.

The immunological mechanisms underlying the clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 
infection and those influencing the disease outcome remain to be defined. 
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have been described to be highly 
increased during COVID-19, however, their role remains elusive. We performed an 
in depth analysis of MDSC in 128 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Polymorphonuclear 
(PMN)-MDSC expanded during COVID-19, in particular in patients who required 
intensive care treatments, and correlated with IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α 
plasma levels. PMN-MDSC inhibited T-cells IFN-γ production upon SARS-CoV-2 
peptides stimulation, through TGF-β- and iNOS-mediated mechanisms, possibly 
contrasting virus elimination. Accordingly, a multivariate regression analysis 
found a strong association between PMN-MDSC percentage and fatal outcome of the 
disease. The PMN-MDSC frequency was higher in non-survivors than survivors at 
the admission time, followed by a decreasing trend. Interestingly, this trend 
was associated with IL-6 increase in non-survivors but not in survivors. In 
conclusion, this study indicates PMN-MDSC as a novel factor in the pathogenesis 
of SARS-CoV2 infection, and open up to new therapeutic options.

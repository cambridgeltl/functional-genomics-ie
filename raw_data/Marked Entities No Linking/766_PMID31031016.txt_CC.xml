<TEXT><![CDATA[Combination of Hypoglycemia and Metformin Impairs Tumor Metabolic Plasticity and 
Growth by Modulating the PP2A-GSK3β-MCL-1 Axis.

Tumor cells may adapt to metabolic challenges by alternating between glycolysis 
and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). To target this metabolic plasticity, we 
combined intermittent fasting, a clinically feasible approach to reduce glucose 
availability, with the OXPHOS inhibitor metformin. In mice exposed to 24-h 
feeding/fasting cycles, metformin impaired tumor growth only when administered 
during fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Synergistic anti-neoplastic effects of the 
metformin/hypoglycemia combination were mediated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β 
(GSK3β) activation downstream of PP2A, leading to a decline in the pro-survival 
protein MCL-1, and cell death. Mechanistically, specific activation of the 
PP2A-GSK3β axis was the sum of metformin-induced inhibition of CIP2A, a PP2A 
suppressor, and of upregulation of the PP2A regulatory subunit B56δ by low 
glucose, leading to an active PP2A-B56δ complex with high affinity toward GSK3β.]]></TEXT>

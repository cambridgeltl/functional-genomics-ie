<TEXT><![CDATA[Staurosporine-induced apoptotic water loss is cell- and attachment-specific.

Apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) is a characteristic cell shrinkage observed 
during apoptosis. There are at least two known processes that may result in the 
AVD: exit of intracellular water and splitting of cells into smaller fragments. 
Although AVD has traditionally been attributed to water loss, direct evidence 
for that is often lacking. In this study, we quantified intracellular water in 
staurosporine-treated cells using a previously described optical microscopic 
technique that combines volume measurements with quantitative phase analysis. 
Water loss was observed in detached HeLa and in adherent MDCK but not in 
adherent HeLa cells. At the same time, adherent HeLa and adherent MDCK cells 
exhibited visually similar apoptotic morphology, including fragmentation and 
activation of caspase-3. Morphological changes and caspase activation were 
prevented by chloride channel blockers DIDS and NPPB in both adherent and 
suspended HeLa cells, while potassium channel blocker TEA was ineffective. We 
conclude that staurosporine-induced dehydration is not a universal cell response 
but depends on the cell type and substrate attachment and can only be judged by 
direct water measurements. The effects of potassium or chloride channel blockers 
do not always correlate with the AVD.]]></TEXT>

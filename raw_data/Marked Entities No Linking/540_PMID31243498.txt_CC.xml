In contrast to the well-known anti-tumor mechanisms of aspirin in inducing 
apoptosis or autophagy, we here for the first time report oncosis induced by 
aspirin in tumor cells. In vitro and in vivo analysis showed that aspirin 
induced compromised Bcl-XL level and subsequent ATP depletion. Overexpression of 
CFP-Bcl-XL in Hela and A549 cells observably inhibited aspirin-induced ATP 
depletion and almost completely inhibited the aspirin-induced cells bubbling, 
while pharmacological inhibition of endogenous Bcl-XL activity by ABT-737 
remarkably promoted aspirin-induced ATP depletion and cells bubbling, suggesting 
the key inhibitory role of Bcl-XL in aspirin-induced oncosis. Overexpression of 
Bax/Bad significantly promoted aspirin-induced oncosis. In addition, cells 
cultured in a glucose-free medium with low ATP level exhibited higher percentage 
of bubbling cells than the cells cultured in a glucose medium with high ATP 
level under aspirin treatment, indicating the important role of ATP depletion in 
aspirin-induced oncosis. Furthermore, caspase-3 was demonstrated to be not 
involved in aspirin-induced oncosis. Animal studies showed that aspirin 
treatment significantly inhibited tumors growth, but did not induce toxicities 
to mice. Collectively, aspirin inhibits tumors growth in mice and induces 
oncosis in which the compromised Bcl-XL and intracellular ATP depletion play a 
dominant role, which provides insights into the therapeutic strategy of aspirin 
in oncology.]]></TEXT>

defense.

STAT1 is a master regulator that orchestrates type 1 and 2 interferon 
(IFN)-induced IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. The mechanisms by which 
STAT1 is phosphorylated and activated upon IFN signaling remain elusive. Our 
work demonstrated that ubiquitination of STAT1 mediated by the E3 ligase RNF220 
contributed significantly to STAT1 activation and innate immune responses. 
Rnf220 gene deficiency resulted in the downregulation of IFN signaling and 
decreased expression of ISGs in response to type 1 and 2 IFNs stimulation and 
Acinetobacter baumannii and HSV-1 infection. Mechanistically, RNF220 interacted 
with STAT1 and mediated the K63-linked polyubiquitination of STAT1 at residue 
K110, which promoted the interaction between STAT1 and the kinase JAK1. The 
expression of RNF220 was induced by pathogenic infection and IFN signaling. 
RNF220 promoted STAT1 ubiquitination and phosphorylation through a positive 
feedback loop. RNF220 haploinsufficiency impaired IFN signaling, and 
RNF220-defective mice were more susceptible to A. baumannii and HSV-1 infection 
than WT mice. Our work offers novel insights into the mechanisms of STAT1 
modulation and provides potential therapeutic targets against bacterial and 
viral infection and inflammatory diseases.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Autophagic degradation of the circadian clock regulator promotes ferroptosis.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) involves a lysosomal 
degradation pathway and plays a context-dependent role in promoting either cell 
survival or cell death during stress; excessive or impaired autophagy is 
implicated in various types of cell death. In particular, lipid 
peroxidation-associated ferroptosis has recently been recognized as a type of 
autophagy-dependent cell death, but the mechanisms involved remain largely 
obscure. Our recent findings demonstrate that clockophagy, namely the selective 
autophagic degradation of the circadian clock regulator ARNTL/BMAL1, promotes 
ferroptotic cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the cargo 
receptor SQSTM1/p62 is responsible for the autophagic degradation of ARNTL in 
response to type 2 ferroptosis inducers (e.g., RSL3 and FIN56), but not type 1 
ferroptosis inducers (e.g., erastin, sulfasalazine, and sorafenib). 
Consequently, clockophagy-mediated ARNTL degradation promotes lipid peroxidation 
and subsequent ferroptosis through blocking HIF1A-dependent fatty acid uptake 
and lipid storage. These findings highlight a novel type of selective autophagy 
in regulated cell death.]]></TEXT>

effector Yki/Yap/Taz in the nucleus.

Hippo signaling controls organ size and tumor progression through a conserved 
pathway leading to nuclear translocation of the transcriptional effector 
Yki/Yap/Taz. Most of our understanding of Hippo signaling pertains to its 
cytoplasmic regulation, but how the pathway is controlled in the nucleus remains 
poorly understood. Here we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by 
which CDK7 promotes Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization in the nucleus to sustain Hippo 
pathway outputs. We found that a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4DCAF12 
binds and targets Yki/Yap/Taz for ubiquitination and degradation, whereas CDK7 
phosphorylates Yki/Yap/Taz at S169/S128/S90 to inhibit CRL4DCAF12 recruitment, 
leading to Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization. As a consequence, inactivation of CDK7 
reduced organ size and inhibited tumor growth, which could be reversed by 
restoring Yki/Yap activity. Our study identifies an unanticipated layer of Hippo 
pathway regulation, defines a novel mechanism by which CDK7 regulates tissue 
growth, and implies CDK7 as a drug target for Yap/Taz-driven cancer.]]></TEXT>

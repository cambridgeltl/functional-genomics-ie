infected cells.

Apoptosis has been postulated to play an important role during feline infectious 
peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection; however, its mechanism is not well 
characterized. This study is focused on apoptosis and transcriptional profiling 
of FIPV-infected cells following in vitro infection of CRFK cells with FIPV 
79-1146 WSU. Flow cytometry was used to determine mode of cell death in first 
42 h post infection (hpi). FIPV infected cells underwent early apoptosis at 9 
hpi (p < 0.05) followed by late apoptosis at 12 hpi (p < 0.05) and necrosis from 
24 hpi (p < 0.05). Then, next generation sequencing was performed on 9 hpi and 
control uninfected cells by Illumina analyzer. An aggregate of 4546 genes (2229 
down-regulated and 2317 up-regulated) from 17 cellular process, 11 molecular 
functions and 130 possible biological pathways were affected by FIPV. 131 genes 
from apoptosis cluster (80 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated) along with 
increase of apoptosis, p53, p38 MAPK, VEGF and chemokines/cytokines signaling 
pathways were probably involved in apoptosis process. Six of the de-regulated 
genes expression (RASSF1, BATF2, MAGEB16, PDCD5, TNFα and TRAF2) and TNFα 
protein concentration were analyzed by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively, at 
different time-points. Up-regulations of both pro-apoptotic (i.e. PDCD5) and 
anti-apoptotic (i.e. TRAF2) were detected from first hpi and continuing to 
deregulate during apoptosis process in the infected cells.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Allosteric SHP2 Inhibitor, IACS-13909, Overcomes EGFR-Dependent and 
EGFR-Independent Resistance Mechanisms toward Osimertinib.

Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP2) is a phosphatase that 
mediates signaling downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and is 
required for full activation of the MAPK pathway. SHP2 inhibition has 
demonstrated tumor growth inhibition in RTK-activated cancers in preclinical 
studies. The long-term effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as the 
EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), osimertinib, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
limited by acquired resistance. Multiple clinically identified mechanisms 
underlie resistance to osimertinib, including mutations in EGFR that preclude 
drug binding as well as EGFR-independent activation of the MAPK pathway through 
alternate RTK (RTK-bypass). It has also been noted that frequently a tumor from 
a single patient harbors more than one resistance mechanism, and the plasticity 
between multiple resistance mechanisms could restrict the effectiveness of 
therapies targeting a single node of the oncogenic signaling network. Here, we 
report the discovery of IACS-13909, a specific and potent allosteric inhibitor 
of SHP2, that suppresses signaling through the MAPK pathway. IACS-13909 potently 
impeded proliferation of tumors harboring a broad spectrum of activated RTKs as 
the oncogenic driver. In EGFR-mutant osimertinib-resistant NSCLC models with 
EGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent resistance mechanisms, IACS-13909, 
administered as a single agent or in combination with osimertinib, potently 
suppressed tumor cell proliferation in vitro and caused tumor regression in 
vivo. Together, our findings provide preclinical evidence for using a SHP2 
inhibitor as a therapeutic strategy in acquired EGFRi-resistant NSCLC. ]]></TEXT>

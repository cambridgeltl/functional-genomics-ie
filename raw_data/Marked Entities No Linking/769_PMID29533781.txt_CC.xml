<TEXT><![CDATA[PKM1 Confers Metabolic Advantages and Promotes Cell-Autonomous Tumor Cell 
Growth.

Expression of PKM2, which diverts glucose-derived carbon from catabolic to 
biosynthetic pathways, is a hallmark of cancer. However, PKM2 function in 
tumorigenesis remains controversial. Here, we show that, when expressed rather 
than PKM2, the PKM isoform PKM1 exhibits a tumor-promoting function in 
KRASG12D-induced or carcinogen-initiated mouse models or in some human cancers. 
Analysis of Pkm mutant mouse lines expressing specific PKM isoforms established 
that PKM1 boosts tumor growth cell intrinsically. PKM1 activated glucose 
catabolism and stimulated autophagy/mitophagy, favoring malignancy. Importantly, 
we observed that pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), including small-cell 
lung cancer (SCLC), express PKM1, and that PKM1 expression is required for SCLC 
cell proliferation. Our findings provide a rationale for targeting PKM1 
therapeutically in certain cancer subtypes, including pulmonary NETs.]]></TEXT>

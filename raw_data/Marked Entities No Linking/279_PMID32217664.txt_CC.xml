<TEXT><![CDATA[Telomere length heterogeneity in ALT cells is maintained by PML-dependent 
localization of the BTR complex to telomeres.

Telomeres consist of TTAGGG repeats bound by protein complexes that serve to 
protect the natural end of linear chromosomes. Most cells maintain telomere 
repeat lengths by using the enzyme telomerase, although there are some cancer 
cells that use a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere extension, termed 
alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Cells that use ALT are 
characterized, in part, by the presence of specialized PML nuclear bodies called 
ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs localize to and cluster telomeric ends 
together with telomeric and DNA damage factors, which led to the proposal that 
these bodies act as a platform on which ALT can occur. However, the necessity of 
APBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used 
CRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly 
define the function of APBs in ALT. We found that PML is required for the ALT 
mechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs' role in localizing the 
BLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends. Strikingly, recruitment of the 
BTR complex to telomeres in a PML-independent manner bypasses the need for PML 
in the ALT pathway, suggesting that BTR localization to telomeres is sufficient 
to sustain ALT activity.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Immunomodulatory activity of IR700-labelled affibody targeting HER2.

There is an urgent need to develop therapeutic approaches that can increase the 
response rate to immuno-oncology agents. Photoimmunotherapy has recently been 
shown to generate anti-tumour immunological responses by releasing 
tumour-associated antigens from ablated tumour cell residues, thereby enhancing 
antigenicity and adjuvanticity. Here, we investigate the feasibility of a novel 
HER2-targeted affibody-based conjugate (ZHER2:2395-IR700) selectively to induce 
cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. The studies in vitro confirmed the 
specificity of ZHER2:2395-IR700 binding to HER2-positive cells and its ability 
to produce reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation. A conjugate 
concentration- and light irradiation-dependent decrease in cell viability was 
also demonstrated. Furthermore, light-activated ZHER2:2395-IR700 triggered all 
hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, as defined by the translocation of 
calreticulin to the cell surface, and the secretion of ATP, HSP70/90 and HMGB1 
from dying cancer cells into the medium. Irradiating a co-culture of immature 
dendritic cells (DCs) and cancer cells exposed to light-activated 
ZHER2:2395-IR700 enhanced DC maturation, as indicated by augmented expression of 
CD86 and HLA-DR. In SKOV-3 xenografts, the ZHER2:2395-IR700-based phototherapy 
delayed tumour growth and increased median overall survival. Collectively, our 
results strongly suggest that ZHER2:2395-IR700 is a promising new therapeutic 
conjugate that has great potential to be applicable for photoimmunotherapy-based 
regimens.]]></TEXT>

with oridonin and cetuximab in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

Combined oridonin (ORI), a natural and safe kaurene diterpenoid isolated from 
Rabdosia rubescens, and cetuximab (Cet), an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, have 
been reported to exert synergistic anti-tumor effects against laryngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (LSCC) both in vitro and in vivo by our group. In the present 
study, we further found that ORI/Cet treatment not only resulted in apoptosis 
but also induced autophagy. AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway was found to be involved 
in the activation of autophagy in ORI/Cet-treated LSCC cells, which is 
independent of p53 status. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
assay showed that ORI/Cet significantly increased the binding NF-κB family 
member p65 with the promotor of BECN 1, and p65-mediated up-regulation of BECN 1 
caused by ORI/Cet is coupled to increased autophagy. On the other hand, we 
demonstrated that either Beclin 1 SiRNA or autophagy inhibitors could increase 
ORI/Cet induced-apoptosis, indicating that autophagy induced by combination of 
the two agents plays a cytoprotective role. Interestingly, 48 h after the 
combined treatment, autophagy began to decrease but apoptosis was significantly 
elevated. Our findings suggest that autophagy might be strongly associated with 
the antitumor efficacy of ORI/Cet, which may be beneficial to the clinical 
application of ORI/Cet in LSCC treatment.]]></TEXT>

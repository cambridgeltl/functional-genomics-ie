<TEXT><![CDATA[Requirement for NF-κB in maintenance of molecular and behavioral circadian 
rhythms in mice.

The mammalian circadian clock is encoded by an autoregulatory transcription 
feedback loop that drives rhythmic behavior and gene expression in the brain and 
peripheral tissues. Transcriptomic analyses indicate cell type-specific effects 
of circadian cycles on rhythmic physiology, although how clock cycles respond to 
environmental stimuli remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that 
activation of the inducible transcription factor NF-κB in response to 
inflammatory stimuli leads to marked inhibition of clock repressors, including 
the Period, Cryptochrome, and Rev-erb genes, within the negative limb. 
Furthermore, activation of NF-κB relocalizes the clock components CLOCK/BMAL1 
genome-wide to sites convergent with those bound by NF-κB, marked by acetylated 
H3K27, and enriched in RNA polymerase II. Abrogation of NF-κB during adulthood 
alters the expression of clock repressors, disrupts clock-controlled gene 
cycles, and impairs rhythmic activity behavior, revealing a role for NF-κB in 
both unstimulated and activated conditions. Together, these data highlight 
NF-κB-mediated transcriptional repression of the clock feedback limb as a cause 
of circadian disruption in response to inflammation.

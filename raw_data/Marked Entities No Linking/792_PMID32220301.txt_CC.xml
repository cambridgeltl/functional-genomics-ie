<TEXT><![CDATA[Loss of CHD1 Promotes Heterogeneous Mechanisms of Resistance to AR-Targeted 
Therapy via Chromatin Dysregulation.

Metastatic prostate cancer is characterized by recurrent genomic copy number 
alterations that are presumed to contribute to resistance to hormone therapy. We 
identified CHD1 loss as a cause of antiandrogen resistance in an in vivo small 
hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of 730 genes deleted in prostate cancer. ATAC-seq and 
RNA-seq analyses showed that CHD1 loss resulted in global changes in open and 
closed chromatin with associated transcriptomic changes. Integrative analysis of 
this data, together with CRISPR-based functional screening, identified four 
transcription factors (NR3C1, POU3F2, NR2F1, and TBX2) that contribute to 
antiandrogen resistance, with associated activation of non-luminal lineage 
programs. Thus, CHD1 loss results in chromatin dysregulation, thereby 
establishing a state of transcriptional plasticity that enables the emergence of 
antiandrogen resistance through heterogeneous mechanisms.]]></TEXT>

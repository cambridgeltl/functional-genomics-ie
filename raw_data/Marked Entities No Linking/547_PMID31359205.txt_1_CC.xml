microgravity.

Astronauts exposed to a gravity-free environment experience cardiovascular 
deconditioning that causes post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance and other 
pathological conditions. Endothelial dysfunction is an important factor 
responsible for this alteration. Our previous study showed enhanced autophagy in 
endothelial cells under simulated microgravity. The present study explored the 
cytoprotective role of autophagy under microgravity in human umbilical vein 
endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that clinorotation for 48 h induced 
apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in HUVECs. ER stress and the 
unfolded protein response (UPR) partially contributed to apoptosis under 
clinorotation. Autophagy partially reduced ER stress and restored UPR signaling 
by autophagic clearance of ubiquitin-protein aggregates, thereby reducing 
apoptosis. In addition, the ER stress antagonist 4-phenylbutyric acid 
upregulated autophagy in HUVECs. Taken together, these findings indicate that 
autophagy plays a protective role against apoptosis under clinorotation by 
clearing protein aggregates and partially restoring the UPR.

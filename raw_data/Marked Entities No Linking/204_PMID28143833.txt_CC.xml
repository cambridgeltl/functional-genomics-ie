tissue regeneration.

Senescence is a form of cell cycle arrest induced by stress such as DNA damage 
and oncogenes. However, while arrested, senescent cells secrete a variety of 
proteins collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype 
(SASP), which can reinforce the arrest and induce senescence in a paracrine 
manner. However, the SASP has also been shown to favor embryonic development, 
wound healing, and even tumor growth, suggesting more complex physiological 
roles than currently understood. Here we uncover timely new functions of the 
SASP in promoting a proregenerative response through the induction of cell 
plasticity and stemness. We show that primary mouse keratinocytes transiently 
exposed to the SASP exhibit increased expression of stem cell markers and 
regenerative capacity in vivo. However, prolonged exposure to the SASP causes a 
subsequent cell-intrinsic senescence arrest to counter the continued 
regenerative stimuli. Finally, by inducing senescence in single cells in vivo in 
the liver, we demonstrate that this activates tissue-specific expression of stem 
cell markers. Together, this work uncovers a primary and beneficial role for the 
SASP in promoting cell plasticity and tissue regeneration and introduces the 
concept that transient therapeutic delivery of senescent cells could be 
harnessed to drive tissue regeneration.]]></TEXT>

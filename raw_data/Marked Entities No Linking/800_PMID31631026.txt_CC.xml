<TEXT><![CDATA[Re-programing Chromatin with a Bifunctional LSD1/HDAC Inhibitor Induces 
Therapeutic Differentiation in DIPG.

H3K27M mutations resulting in epigenetic dysfunction are frequently observed in 
diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPGs), an incurable pediatric cancer. We 
conduct a CRISPR screen revealing that knockout of KDM1A encoding 
lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) sensitizes DIPG cells to histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Consistently, Corin, a bifunctional inhibitor of 
HDACs and LSD1, potently inhibits DIPG growth in vitro and in xenografts. 
Mechanistically, Corin increases H3K27me3 levels suppressed by H3K27M histones, 
and simultaneously increases HDAC-targeted H3K27ac and LSD1-targeted H3K4me1 at 
differentiation-associated genes. Corin treatment induces cell death, cell-cycle 
arrest, and a cellular differentiation phenotype and drives transcriptional 
changes correlating with increased survival time in DIPG patients. These data 
suggest a strategy for treating DIPG by simultaneously inhibiting LSD1 and 
HDACs.]]></TEXT>

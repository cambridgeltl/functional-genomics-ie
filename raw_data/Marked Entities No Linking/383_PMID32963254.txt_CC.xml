death.

Tumor regression in sites distant to the irradiated field are thought to be 
associated with emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 
molecules and generation of immunogenic cell death (ICD). Glioma stem cells 
(GSCs) are resistant to high doses of radiation, and ultimately select the 
outgrowth of a more aggressive tumor. This study showed high-dose IR triggered 
fewer DAMPs molecules exposure and release in GSCs comparing to matched 
non-GSCs. Downregulation of binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) promoted 
IR-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress to generate DAMPs molecules by PERK and 
IRE1-Î± phosphorylation, and increased dendritic cells mature and effector T 
lymphocytes activation. GSCs treated with Bip knockdown and IR efficiently 
prevented tumor generation, and reduced post-radiotherapy tumor recurrence. 
These data suggest that Bip plays a critical role in inhibition of IR-induced 
ICD in GSCs, and Bip inhibition may be a promising strategy on adjuvant therapy 
by ameliorating tumor immune microenvironment.]]></TEXT>

The receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a key 
mediator of regulated cell death and inflammation. Recent studies suggest that 
RIPK1 inhibition would fundamentally improve the therapy of RIPK1-dependent 
organ damage in stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, and systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome. Additionally, it could ameliorate or prevent 
multi-organ failure induced by cytokine release in the context of 
hyperinflammation, as seen in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we searched for a 
RIPK1 inhibitor and present the aromatic antiepileptic and FDA-approved drug 
primidone (Liskantin®) as a potent inhibitor of RIPK1 activation in vitro and in 
a murine model of TNFα-induced shock, which mimics the hyperinflammatory state 
of cytokine release syndrome. Furthermore, we detected for the first time RIPK1 
activation in the respiratory tract epithelium of hospitalized patients who 
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data provide a strong rationale 
for evaluating the drug primidone in conditions of hyperinflammation in humans.]]></TEXT>

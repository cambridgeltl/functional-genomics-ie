<TEXT><![CDATA[Autophagy-dependent ferroptosis drives tumor-associated macrophage polarization 
via release and uptake of oncogenic KRAS protein.

KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human neoplasia. Despite a large 
investment to understand the effects of KRAS mutation in cancer cells, the 
direct effects of the oncogenetic KRAS activation on immune cells remain 
elusive. Here, we report that extracellular KRASG12D is essential for pancreatic 
tumor-associated macrophage polarization. Oxidative stress induces KRASG12D 
protein release from cancer cells succumbing to autophagy-dependent ferroptosis. 
Extracellular KRASG12D packaged into exosomes then is taken up by macrophages 
through an AGER-dependent mechanism. KRASG12D causes macrophages to switch to an 
M2-like pro-tumor phenotype via STAT3-dependent fatty acid oxidation. 
Consequently, the disruption of KRASG12D release and uptake can abolish the 
macrophage-mediated stimulation of pancreatic adenocarcinomas in mouse models. 
Importantly, the level of KRASG12D expression in macrophages correlates with 
poor survival in pancreatic cancer patients. These findings not only identify 
extracellular KRASG12D as a key mediator of cancer cell-macrophage 
communication, but also provide a novel KRAS-targeted anticancer strategy.]]></TEXT>

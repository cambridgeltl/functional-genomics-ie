<TEXT><![CDATA[POU2F3 is a master regulator of a tuft cell-like variant of small cell lung 
cancer.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is widely considered to be a tumor of pulmonary 
neuroendocrine cells; however, a variant form of this disease has been described 
that lacks neuroendocrine features. Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR 
screening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) 
POU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful 
dependency in a subset of SCLC lines. An analysis of human SCLC specimens 
revealed that POU2F3 is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC tumors that lack 
expression of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a 
chemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling 
experiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell 
identity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can 
be classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, 
ASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique dependencies in 
POU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the 
receptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). These 
data reveal POU2F3 as a cell identity determinant and a dependency in a tuft 
cell-like variant of SCLC, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of 
origin or a trans-differentiation event in this disease.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Genomic and Transcriptomic Determinants of Therapy Resistance and Immune 
Landscape Evolution during Anti-EGFR Treatment in Colorectal Cancer.

Despite biomarker stratification, the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab is only 
effective against a subgroup of colorectal cancers (CRCs). This genomic and 
transcriptomic analysis of the cetuximab resistance landscape in 35 RAS 
wild-type CRCs identified associations of NF1 and non-canonical RAS/RAF 
aberrations with primary resistance and validated transcriptomic CRC subtypes as 
non-genetic predictors of benefit. Sixty-four percent of biopsies with acquired 
resistance harbored no genetic resistance drivers. Most of these had switched 
from a cetuximab-sensitive transcriptomic subtype at baseline to a fibroblast- 
and growth factor-rich subtype at progression. Fibroblast-supernatant conferred 
cetuximab resistance in vitro, confirming a major role for non-genetic 
resistance through stromal remodeling. Cetuximab treatment increased cytotoxic 
immune infiltrates and PD-L1 and LAG3 immune checkpoint expression, potentially 
providing opportunities to treat cetuximab-resistant CRCs with immunotherapy.]]></TEXT>

pyroptosis.

Hypomagnesemia is a significant risk factor for critically ill patients to 
develop sepsis, a life-threatening disease with a mortality rate over 25%. Our 
clinic data analysis showed that hypomagnesemia is associated with a decreased 
monocyte count in septic patients. At the cellular level, we found that Mg2+ 
inhibits pyroptosis. Specifically, Mg2+ limits the oligomerization and membrane 
localization of gasdermin D N-terminal (GSDMD-NT) upon the activation of either 
the canonical or noncanonical pyroptotic pathway. Mechanistically, we 
demonstrated that Ca2+ influx is a prerequisite for the function of GSDMD-NT. 
Mg2+ blocks Ca2+ influx by inhibiting the ATP-gated Ca2+ channel P2X7, thereby 
impeding the function of GSDMD-NT and inhibiting lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced noncanonical pyroptosis. Furthermore, Mg2+ administration protects 
mice from LPS-induced lethal septic shock. Together, our data reveal the 
underlying mechanism of how Mg2+ inhibits pyroptosis and suggest potential 
clinic applications of magnesium supplementation for sepsis prevention and 
treatment.]]></TEXT>

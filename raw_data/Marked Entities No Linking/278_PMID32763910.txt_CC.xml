Identifying modifiers of dosage-sensitive genes involved in neurodegenerative 
disorders is imperative to discover novel genetic risk factors and potential 
therapeutic entry points. In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a 
dosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar 
ataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential 
to prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely 
unknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1's unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' 
UTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. 
Based on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' 
UTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator 
that binds to a conserved site in ATXN1's 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and 
translational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus 
(AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and 
mitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings 
provide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional 
evidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the 
possibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors 
for yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.

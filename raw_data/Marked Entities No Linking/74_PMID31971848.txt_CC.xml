How energy deprivation induces macroautophagy/autophagy is not fully understood. 
Here, we show that Atg11, a receptor protein for cargo recognition in selective 
autophagy, is required for the initiation of glucose starvation-induced 
autophagy. Upon glucose starvation, Atg11 facilitates the interaction between 
Snf1 and Atg1, thus is required for Snf1-dependent Atg1 activation. Phagophore 
assembly site (PAS) formation requires Atg11 via its control of the association 
of Atg17 with Atg29-Atg31. The binding of Atg11 with Atg9 is crucial for 
recruiting Atg9 vesicles to the PAS and, thus, glucose starvation-induced 
autophagy. We propose Atg11 as a key initiation factor controlling multiple key 
steps in energy deprivation-induced autophagy.]]></TEXT>

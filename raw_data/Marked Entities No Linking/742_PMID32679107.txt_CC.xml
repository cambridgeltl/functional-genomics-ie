Metastasis.

The cytokine interleukin-6 (IL6) and its downstream effector STAT3 constitute a 
key oncogenic pathway, which has been thought to be functionally connected to 
estrogen receptor α (ER) in breast cancer. We demonstrate that IL6/STAT3 
signaling drives metastasis in ER+ breast cancer independent of ER. STAT3 
hijacks a subset of ER enhancers to drive a distinct transcriptional program. 
Although these enhancers are shared by both STAT3 and ER, IL6/STAT3 activity is 
refractory to standard ER-targeted therapies. Instead, inhibition of STAT3 
activity using the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib decreases breast cancer invasion 
in vivo. Therefore, IL6/STAT3 and ER oncogenic pathways are functionally 
decoupled, highlighting the potential of IL6/STAT3-targeted therapies in ER+ 
breast cancer.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Therapeutic Targeting of CDK12/CDK13 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.

Epigenetic regulation enables tumors to respond to changing environments during 
tumor progression and metastases and facilitates treatment resistance. Targeting 
chromatin modifiers or catalytic effectors of transcription is an emerging 
anti-cancer strategy. The cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 12 and 13 
phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, regulating 
transcription and co-transcriptional processes. Here we report the development 
of SR-4835, a highly selective dual inhibitor of CDK12 and CDK13, which disables 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Mechanistically, inhibition or loss 
of CDK12/CDK13 triggers intronic polyadenylation site cleavage that suppresses 
the expression of core DNA damage response proteins. This provokes a "BRCAness" 
phenotype that results in deficiencies in DNA damage repair, promoting synergy 
with DNA-damaging chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors.]]></TEXT>

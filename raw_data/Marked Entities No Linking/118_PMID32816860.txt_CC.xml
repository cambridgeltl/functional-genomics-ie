Evasion.


Therapeutic checkpoint antibodies blocking programmed death receptor 
1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling have radically improved clinical 
outcomes in cancer. However, the regulation of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells 
is still poorly understood. Here we show that intratumoral copper levels 
influence PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Deep analysis of the The Cancer 
Genome Atlas database and tissue microarrays showed strong correlation between 
the major copper influx transporter copper transporter 1 (CTR-1) and PD-L1 
expression across many cancers but not in corresponding normal tissues. Copper 
supplementation enhanced PD-L1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in cancer 
cells and RNA sequencing revealed that copper regulates key signaling pathways 
mediating PD-L1-driven cancer immune evasion. Conversely, copper chelators 
inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and EGFR and promoted ubiquitin-mediated 
degradation of PD-L1. Copper-chelating drugs also significantly increased the 
number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T and natural killer cells, slowed tumor 
growth, and improved mouse survival. Overall, this study reveals an important 
role for copper in regulating PD-L1 and suggests that anticancer immunotherapy 
might be enhanced by pharmacologically reducing intratumor copper levels. ]]></TEXT>

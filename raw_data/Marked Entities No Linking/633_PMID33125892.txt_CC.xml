Trained innate immunity, induced via modulation of mature myeloid cells or their 
bone marrow progenitors, mediates sustained increased responsiveness to 
secondary challenges. Here, we investigated whether anti-tumor immunity can be 
enhanced through induction of trained immunity. Pre-treatment of mice with 
β-glucan, a fungal-derived prototypical agonist of trained immunity, resulted in 
diminished tumor growth. The anti-tumor effect of β-glucan-induced trained 
immunity was associated with transcriptomic and epigenetic rewiring of 
granulopoiesis and neutrophil reprogramming toward an anti-tumor phenotype; this 
process required type I interferon signaling irrespective of adaptive immunity 
in the host. Adoptive transfer of neutrophils from β-glucan-trained mice to 
naive recipients suppressed tumor growth in the latter in a ROS-dependent 
manner. Moreover, the anti-tumor effect of β-glucan-induced trained 
granulopoiesis was transmissible by bone marrow transplantation to recipient 
naive mice. Our findings identify a novel and therapeutically relevant 
anti-tumor facet of trained immunity involving appropriate rewiring of 
granulopoiesis.]]></TEXT>

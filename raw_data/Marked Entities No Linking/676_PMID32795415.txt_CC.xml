<TEXT><![CDATA[Ubiquitin Ligase COP1 Suppresses Neuroinflammation by Degrading c/EBPβ in 
Microglia.

Dysregulated microglia are intimately involved in neurodegeneration, including 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but the mechanisms controlling pathogenic 
microglial gene expression remain poorly understood. The transcription factor 
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (c/EBPβ) regulates pro-inflammatory genes in 
microglia and is upregulated in AD. We show expression of c/EBPβ in microglia is 
regulated post-translationally by the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (also called RFWD2). 
In the absence of COP1, c/EBPβ accumulates rapidly and drives a potent 
pro-inflammatory and neurodegeneration-related gene program, evidenced by 
increased neurotoxicity in microglia-neuronal co-cultures. Antibody blocking 
studies reveal that neurotoxicity is almost entirely attributable to complement. 
Remarkably, loss of a single allele of Cebpb prevented the pro-inflammatory 
phenotype. COP1-deficient microglia markedly accelerated tau-mediated 
neurodegeneration in a mouse model where activated microglia play a deleterious 
role. Thus, COP1 is an important suppressor of pathogenic c/EBPβ-dependent gene 
expression programs in microglia.]]></TEXT>

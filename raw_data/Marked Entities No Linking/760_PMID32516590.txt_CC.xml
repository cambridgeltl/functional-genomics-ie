<TEXT><![CDATA[Reduction of Liver Metastasis Stiffness Improves Response to Bevacizumab in 
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

Tumors are influenced by the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. 
Using patient samples and atomic force microscopy, we found that tissue 
stiffness is higher in liver metastases than in primary colorectal tumors. 
Highly activated metastasis-associated fibroblasts increase tissue stiffness, 
which enhances angiogenesis and anti-angiogenic therapy resistance. Drugs 
targeting the renin-angiotensin system, normally prescribed to treat 
hypertension, inhibit fibroblast contraction and extracellular matrix 
deposition, thereby reducing liver metastases stiffening and increasing the 
anti-angiogenic effects of bevacizumab. Patients treated with bevacizumab showed 
prolonged survival when concomitantly treated with renin-angiotensin inhibitors, 
highlighting the importance of modulating the mechanical microenvironment for 
therapeutic regimens.]]></TEXT>

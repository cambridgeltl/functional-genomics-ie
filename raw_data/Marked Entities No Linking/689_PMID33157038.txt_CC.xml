<TEXT><![CDATA[β-Coronaviruses Use Lysosomes for Egress Instead of the Biosynthetic Secretory 
Pathway.

β-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that 
includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much 
is known regarding their cellular entry and replication pathways, but their mode 
of egress remains uncertain. Using imaging methodologies and virus-specific 
reporters, we demonstrate that β-coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for 
egress rather than the biosynthetic secretory pathway more commonly used by 
other enveloped viruses. This unconventional egress is regulated by the Arf-like 
small GTPase Arl8b and can be blocked by the Rab7 GTPase competitive inhibitor 
CID1067700. Such non-lytic release of β-coronaviruses results in lysosome 
deacidification, inactivation of lysosomal degradation enzymes, and disruption 
of antigen presentation pathways. β-Coronavirus-induced exploitation of 
lysosomal organelles for egress provides insights into the cellular and 
immunological abnormalities observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic 
modalities.

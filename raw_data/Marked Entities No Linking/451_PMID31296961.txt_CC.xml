and tumorigenesis.

Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are tumor initiating cells that can self-renew 
and are highly tumorigenic and chemoresistant. Therefore, the identification of 
factors critical for BCSC function is vital for the development of therapies. 
Here, we report that DNMT1-mediated FOXO3a promoter hypermethylation leads to 
downregulation of FOXO3a expression in breast cancer. FOXO3a is functionally 
related to the inhibition of FOXM1/SOX2 signaling and to the consequent 
suppression of BCSCs properties and tumorigenicity. Moreover, we found that SOX2 
directly transactivates DNMT1 expression and thereby alters the methylation 
landscape, which in turn feedback inhibits FOXO3a expression. Inhibition of DNMT 
activity suppressed tumor growth via regulation of FOXO3a/FOXM1/SOX2 signaling 
in breast cancer. Clinically, we observed a significant inverse correlation 
between FOXO3a and FOXM1/SOX2/DNMT1 expression levels, and loss of FOXO3a 
expression or increased expression of FOXM1, SOX2, and DNMT1 predicted poor 
prognosis in breast cancer. Collectively, our findings suggest an important role 
of the DNMT1/FOXO3a/FOXM1/SOX2 pathway in regulating BCSCs properties, 
suggesting potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[UAP56/DDX39B is a major cotranscriptional RNA-DNA helicase that unwinds harmful 
R loops genome-wide.

Nonscheduled R loops represent a major source of DNA damage and replication 
stress. Cells have different ways to prevent R-loop accumulation. One mechanism 
relies on the conserved THO complex in association with cotranscriptional RNA 
processing factors including the RNA-dependent ATPase UAP56/DDX39B and histone 
modifiers such as the SIN3 deacetylase in humans. We investigated the function 
of UAP56/DDX39B in R-loop removal. We show that UAP56 depletion causes R-loop 
accumulation, R-loop-mediated genome instability, and replication fork stalling. 
We demonstrate an RNA-DNA helicase activity in UAP56 and show that its 
overexpression suppresses R loops and genome instability induced by depleting 
five different unrelated factors. UAP56/DDX39B localizes to active chromatin and 
prevents the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids over the entire genome. We propose 
that, in addition to its RNA processing role, UAP56/DDX39B is a key helicase 
required to eliminate harmful cotranscriptional RNA structures that otherwise 
would block transcription and replication.]]></TEXT>

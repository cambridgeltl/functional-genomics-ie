cancer cell proliferation via the Gas6/MerTK signaling pathway.

In addition to the role of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 
facilitating tumour cells escape from immune surveillance, it is considered as a 
crucial effector in transducing intrinsic signals to promote tumour development. 
Our previous study has pointed out that PD-L1 promotes non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here we 
first demonstrated that PD-L1 expression levels were positively correlated with 
p-MerTK levels in patient samples and NSCLC cell lines. In addition, PD-L1 
knockdown led to the reduced phosphorylation level of MerTK in vitro. We next 
showed that PD-L1 regulated NSCLC cell proliferation via Gas6/MerTK signaling 
pathway in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we 
unexpectedly found that PD-L1 translocated into the nucleus of cancer cells 
which was facilitated through the binding of Karyopherin Î²1 (KPNB1). Nuclear 
PD-L1 (nPD-L1), coupled with transcription factor Sp1, regulated the synthesis 
of Gas6 mRNA and promoted Gas6 secretion to activate MerTK signaling pathway. 
Taken together, our results shed light on the novel role of nPD-L1 in NSCLC cell 
proliferation and reveal a new molecular mechanism underlying nPD-L1-mediated 
Gas6/MerTK signaling activation. All above findings provide the possible 
combinational implications for PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy in the clinic.]]></TEXT>

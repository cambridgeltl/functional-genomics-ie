effect through YTHDF1/HK2 modification.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) serves as the most common and conserved internal 
transcriptional modification. However, the roles of m6A on cervical cancer (CC) 
tumorigenesis are still unclear. Here, results indicated that METTL3 was 
significantly upregulated in CC tissue and cells, which was closely correlated 
with the lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of CC patients. MeRIP-Seq 
analysis revealed the m6A profiles in CC cells. Functionally, METTL3 promoted 
the proliferation and Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) of CC cells. 
Mechanistically, METTL3 targeted the 3'-Untranslated Region (3'-UTR) of 
hexokinase 2 (HK2) mRNA. Moreover, METTL3 recruited YTHDF1, a m6A reader, to 
enhance HK2 stability. These findings demonstrated that METTL3 enhanced the HK2 
stability through YTHDF1-mediated m6A modification, thereby promoting the 
Warburg effect of CC, which might promote a novel insight for the CC treatment.

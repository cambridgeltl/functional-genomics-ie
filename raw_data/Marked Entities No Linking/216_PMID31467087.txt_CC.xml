<TEXT><![CDATA[Control of homologous recombination by the HROB-MCM8-MCM9 pathway.

DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) is essential for genomic integrity, 
tumor suppression, and the formation of gametes. HR uses DNA synthesis to repair 
lesions such as DNA double-strand breaks and stalled DNA replication forks, but 
despite having a good understanding of the steps leading to homology search and 
strand invasion, we know much less of the mechanisms that establish 
recombination-associated DNA polymerization. Here, we report that C17orf53/HROB 
is an OB-fold-containing factor involved in HR that acts by recruiting the 
MCM8-MCM9 helicase to sites of DNA damage to promote DNA synthesis. Mice with 
targeted mutations in Hrob are infertile due to depletion of germ cells and 
display phenotypes consistent with a prophase I meiotic arrest. The 
HROB-MCM8-MCM9 pathway acts redundantly with the HELQ helicase, and cells 
lacking both HROB and HELQ have severely impaired HR, suggesting that they 
underpin two major routes for the completion of HR downstream from RAD51. The 
function of HROB in HR is reminiscent of that of gp59, which acts as the 
replicative helicase loader during bacteriophage T4 recombination-dependent DNA 
replication. We therefore propose that the loading of MCM8-MCM9 by HROB may 
similarly be a key step in the establishment of mammalian 
recombination-associated DNA synthesis.

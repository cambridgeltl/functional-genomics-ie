Receptor-mediated mitophagy is a crucial process involved in mitochondria 
quality control. AMBRA1 is a mitophagy receptor for the selective removal of 
damaged mitochondria in mammalian cells. A critical unresolved issue is how 
AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy is controlled in response to cellular stress. Here, we 
investigated the role of BCL2-family proteins on AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy and 
showed that MCL1 delays AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy. Indeed, MCL1 overexpression 
is sufficient to inhibit recruitment to mitochondria of the E3 Ubiquitin ligase 
HUWE1, a crucial dynamic partner of AMBRA1, upon AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy 
induction. In addition, we found that during mitophagy induced by AMBRA1, MCL1 
levels decreased but were sustained by inhibition of the GSK-3β kinase, which 
delayed AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Also, we showed that MCL1 was phosphorylated 
by GSK-3β at a conserved GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S159) during 
AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy and that this event was accompanied by HUWE1-dependent 
MCL1 degradation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that MCL1 stability is 
regulated by the kinase GSK-3β and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 in regulating 
AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Our work thus defines MCL1 as an upstream 
stress-sensitive protein, functional in AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy.]]></TEXT>

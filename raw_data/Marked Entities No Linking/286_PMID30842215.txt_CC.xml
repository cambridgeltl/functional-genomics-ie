human glioblastoma stem cells.

Developmental signal transduction pathways act diversely, with context-dependent 
roles across systems and disease types. Glioblastomas (GBMs), which are the 
poorest prognosis primary brain cancers, strongly resemble developmental 
systems, but these growth processes have not been exploited therapeutically, 
likely in part due to the extreme cellular and genetic heterogeneity observed in 
these tumors. The role of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in GBM stem cell (GSC) renewal 
and fate decisions remains controversial. Here, we report context-specific 
actions of Wnt/βcatenin signaling in directing cellular fate specification and 
renewal. A subset of primary GBM-derived stem cells requires Wnt proteins for 
self-renewal, and this subset specifically relies on Wnt/βcatenin signaling for 
enhanced tumor burden in xenograft models. In an orthotopic Wnt reporter model, 
Wnthi GBM cells (which exhibit high levels of βcatenin signaling) are a 
faster-cycling, highly self-renewing stem cell pool. In contrast, Wntlo cells 
(with low levels of signaling) are slower cycling and have decreased 
self-renewing potential. Dual inhibition of Wnt/βcatenin and Notch signaling in 
GSCs that express high levels of the proneural transcription factor ASCL1 leads 
to robust neuronal differentiation and inhibits clonogenic potential. Our work 
identifies new contexts for Wnt modulation for targeting stem cell 
differentiation and self-renewal in GBM heterogeneity, which deserve further 
exploration therapeutically.]]></TEXT>

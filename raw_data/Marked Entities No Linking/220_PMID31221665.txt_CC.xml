<TEXT><![CDATA[Enhancement of LIN28B-induced hematopoietic reprogramming by IGF2BP3.

Fetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) hold promise to cure a 
wide array of hematological diseases, and we previously found a role for the 
RNA-binding protein (RBP) Lin28b in respecifying adult HSPCs to resemble their 
fetal counterparts. Here we show by single-cell RNA sequencing that Lin28b alone 
was insufficient for complete reprogramming of gene expression from the adult 
toward the fetal pattern. Using proteomics and in situ analyses, we found that 
Lin28b (and its closely related paralog, Lin28a) directly interacted with 
Igf2bp3, another RBP, and their enforced co-expression in adult HSPCs 
reactivated fetal-like B-cell development in vivo more efficiently than either 
factor alone. In B-cell progenitors, Lin28b and Igf2bp3 jointly stabilized 
thousands of mRNAs by binding at the same sites, including those of the B-cell 
regulators Pax5 and Arid3a as well as Igf2bp3 mRNA itself, forming an 
autoregulatory loop. Our results suggest that Lin28b and Igf2bp3 are at the 
center of a gene regulatory network that mediates the fetal-adult hematopoietic 
switch. A method to efficiently generate induced fetal-like hematopoietic stem 
cells (ifHSCs) will facilitate basic studies of their biology and possibly pave 
a path toward their clinical application.]]></TEXT>

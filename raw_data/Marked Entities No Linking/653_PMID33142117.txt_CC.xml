Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors have a nutrient-poor, 
desmoplastic, and highly innervated tumor microenvironment. Although neurons can 
release stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic 
contribution of peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral 
axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser 
(exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser 
deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and 
TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor 
(NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, 
exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in 
mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal innervation using 
LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor growth. Our data 
indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical adaptation to 
support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments.]]></TEXT>

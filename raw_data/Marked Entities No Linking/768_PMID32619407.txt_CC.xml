<TEXT><![CDATA[Telomere Stress Potentiates STING-Dependent Anti-tumor Immunity.

Telomerase is an attractive target for anti-tumor therapy as it is almost 
universally expressed in cancer cells. Here, we show that treatment with a 
telomere-targeting drug, 6-thio-2'-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), leads to tumor 
regression through innate and adaptive immune-dependent responses in syngeneic 
and humanized mouse models of telomerase-expressing cancers. 6-thio-dG treatment 
causes telomere-associated DNA damages that are sensed by dendritic cells (DCs) 
and activates the host cytosolic DNA sensing STING/interferon I pathway, 
resulting in enhanced cross-priming capacity of DCs and tumor-specific CD8+ 
TÂ cell activation. Moreover, 6-thio-dG overcomes resistance to checkpoint 
blockade in advanced cancer models. Our results unveil how telomere stress 
increases innate sensing and adaptive anti-tumor immunity and provide strong 
rationales for combining telomere-targeting therapy with immunotherapy.]]></TEXT>

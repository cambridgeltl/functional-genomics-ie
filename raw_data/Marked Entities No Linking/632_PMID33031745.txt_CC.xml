ALS.

Cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 is a disease hallmark for many cases of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), associated with a neuroinflammatory 
cytokine profile related to upregulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and type I 
interferon (IFN) pathways. Here we show that this inflammation is driven by the 
cytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) 
when TDP-43 invades mitochondria and releases DNA via the permeability 
transition pore. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of cGAS and its 
downstream signaling partner STING prevents upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN 
induced by TDP-43 in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons 
and in TDP-43 mutant mice. Finally, we document elevated levels of the specific 
cGAS signaling metabolite cGAMP in spinal cord samples from patients, which may 
be a biomarker of mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation in ALS. Our results 
identify mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation as critical determinants of 
TDP-43-associated pathology and demonstrate the potential for targeting this 
pathway in ALS.]]></TEXT>

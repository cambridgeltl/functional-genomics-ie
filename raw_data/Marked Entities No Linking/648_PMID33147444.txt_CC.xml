Infection.

Identification of host genes essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may reveal novel therapeutic targets and 
inform our understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. 
Here we performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2, 
Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), bat CoV HKU5 expressing the 
SARS-CoV-1 spike, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 
spike. We identified known SARS-CoV-2 host factors, including the receptor ACE2 
and protease Cathepsin L. We additionally discovered pro-viral genes and 
pathways, including HMGB1 and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, that are 
SARS lineage and pan-coronavirus specific, respectively. We show that HMGB1 
regulates ACE2 expression and is critical for entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, 
and NL63. We also show that small-molecule antagonists of identified gene 
products inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in monkey and human cells, demonstrating 
the conserved role of these genetic hits across species. This identifies 
potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and reveals SARS lineage-specific 
and pan-CoV host factors that regulate susceptibility to highly pathogenic CoVs.]]></TEXT>

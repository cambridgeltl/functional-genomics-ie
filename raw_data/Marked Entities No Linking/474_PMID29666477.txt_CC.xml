subcellular events that precede plasma membrane rupture.

Pyroptosis is rapidly emerging as a mechanism of anti-microbial host defense, 
and of extracellular release of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines interleukin 
(IL)-1Î² and IL-18, which contributes to autoinflammatory pathology. Caspases 1, 
4, 5 and 11 trigger this regulated form of necrosis by cleaving the pyroptosis 
effector gasdermin D (GSDMD), causing its pore-forming amino-terminal domain to 
oligomerize and perforate the plasma membrane. However, the subcellular events 
that precede pyroptotic cell lysis are ill defined. In this study, we triggered 
primary macrophages to undergo pyroptosis from three inflammasome types and 
recorded their dynamics and morphology using high-resolution live-cell spinning 
disk confocal laser microscopy. Based on quantitative analysis of single-cell 
subcellular events, we propose a model of pyroptotic cell disintegration that is 
initiated by opening of GSDMD-dependent ion channels or pores that are more 
restrictive than recently proposed GSDMD pores, followed by osmotic cell 
swelling, commitment of mitochondria and other membrane-bound organelles prior 
to sudden rupture of the plasma membrane and full permeability to intracellular 
proteins. This study provides a dynamic framework for understanding cellular 
changes that occur during pyroptosis, and charts a chronological sequence of 
GSDMD-mediated subcellular events that define pyroptotic cell death at the 
single-cell level.]]></TEXT>

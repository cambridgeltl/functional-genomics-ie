transcytosis.

Diabetes is a recognized high-risk factor for the development of 
atherosclerosis, in which macroautophagy/autophagy is emerging to play essential 
roles. The retention of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in 
subendothelial space following transcytosis across the endothelium is the 
initial step of atherosclerosis. Here, we identified that high glucose could 
promote atherosclerosis by stimulating transcytosis of LDL. By inhibiting 
AMPK-MTOR-PIK3C3 pathway, high glucose suppresses the CAV-CAVIN-LC3B-mediated 
autophagic degradation of CAV1; therefore, more CAV1 is accumulated in the 
cytosol and utilized to form more caveolae in the cell membrane and facilitates 
the LDL transcytosis across endothelial cells. For a proof of concept, higher 
levels of lipids were accumulated in the subendothelial space of umbilical 
venous walls from pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 
compared to those of pregnant women without GDM. Our results reveal that high 
glucose stimulates LDL transcytosis by a novel CAV1-CAVIN1-LC3B 
signaling-mediated autophagic degradation pathway.]]></TEXT>

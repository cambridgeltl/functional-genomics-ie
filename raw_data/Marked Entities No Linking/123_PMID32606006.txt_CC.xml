Cell Self-Renewal by Blocking cAMP Signaling.

N 6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification of mammalian mRNAs. 
RNA methylation fine tunes RNA stability and translation, altering cell fate. 
The fat mass- and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is an m6A demethylase with 
oncogenic properties in leukemia. Here, we show that FTO expression is 
suppressed in ovarian tumors and cancer stem cells (CSC). FTO inhibited the 
self-renewal of ovarian CSC and suppressed tumorigenesis in vivo, both of which 
required FTO demethylase activity. Integrative RNA sequencing and m6A mapping 
analysis revealed significant transcriptomic changes associated with FTO 
overexpression and m6A loss involving stem cell signaling, RNA transcription, 
and mRNA splicing pathways. By reducing m6A levels at the 3'UTR and the mRNA 
stability of two phosphodiesterase genes (PDE1C and PDE4B), FTO augmented second 
messenger 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling and suppressed 
stemness features of ovarian cancer cells. Our results reveal a previously 
unappreciated tumor suppressor function of FTO in ovarian CSC mediated through 
inhibition of cAMP signaling. ]]></TEXT>

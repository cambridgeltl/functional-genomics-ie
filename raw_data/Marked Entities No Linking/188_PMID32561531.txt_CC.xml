<TEXT><![CDATA[IL6 Fuels Durable Memory for Th17 Cell-Mediated Responses to Tumors.

The accessibility of adoptive T-cell transfer therapies (ACT) is hindered by the 
cost and time required for product development. Here we describe a streamlined 
ACT protocol using Th17 cells expanded only 4 days ex vivo. While shortening 
expansion compromised cell yield, this method licensed Th17 cells to eradicate 
large tumors to a greater extent than cells expanded longer term. Day 4 Th17 
cells engrafted, induced release of multiple cytokines including IL6, IL17, 
MCP-1, and GM-CSF in the tumor-bearing host, and persisted as memory cells. IL6 
was a critical component for efficacy of these therapies via its promotion of 
long-term immunity and resistance to tumor relapse. Mechanistically, IL6 
diminished engraftment of FoxP3+ donor T cells, corresponding with robust tumor 
infiltration by donor effector over regulatory cells for the Day 4 Th17 cell 
product relative to cell products expanded longer durations ex vivo. 
Collectively, this work describes a method to rapidly generate therapeutic 
T-cell products for ACT and implicates IL6 in promoting durable immunity of Th17 
cells against large, established solid tumors.]]></TEXT>

Some therapeutics for parasitic, cardiac and neurological diseases activate 
apoptosis. Therefore, the study of apoptotic proteins in pathogenic organisms is 
relevant. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis in unicellular organisms 
remain elusive, despite morphological evidence of its occurrence. In Trypanosoma 
cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, metacaspase 3 (TcMCA3), seems to 
have a key role in parasite apoptosis. Accordingly, this work provides data 
concerning TcMCA3 regulation through its interaction with procaspase-activating 
compound 1 (PAC-1), a procaspase 3 activator. Indeed, PAC-1 reduced T. cruzi 
epimastigote viability with an IC50 of 14.12 µM and induced loss of 
mitochondrial potential and exposure of phosphatidylserine, features of the 
apoptotic process. Notwithstanding, those PAC-1-inducible effects were not 
conserved in metacyclic trypomastigotes. Moreover, PAC-1 reduced the viability 
of mammalian cells with a greater IC50 (25.70 µM) compared to T. cruzi 
epimastigotes, indicating distinct modes of binding between caspases and 
metacaspases. To shed light on the selectivity of metacaspases and caspases, we 
determined the structural features related to the PAC-1 binding sites in both 
types of proteins. These data are important for improving the understanding of 
the apoptosis pathway in T. cruzi so that TcMCA3 could be better targeted with 
future pharmaceuticals.]]></TEXT>

interacting with MAVS and increasing ROS production.

Influenza A virus can evade host innate immune response that is involved in 
several viral proteins with complicated mechanisms. To date, how influenza A M2 
protein modulates the host innate immunity remains unclear. Herein, we showed 
that M2 protein colocalized and interacted with MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral 
signaling protein) on mitochondria, and positively regulated MAVS-mediated 
innate immunity. Further studies revealed that M2 induced reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) production that was required for activation of 
macroautophagy/autophagy and enhancement of MAVS signaling pathway. Importantly, 
the proton channel activity of M2 protein was demonstrated to be essential for 
ROS production and antagonizing the autophagy pathway to control MAVS 
aggregation, thereby enhancing MAVS signal activity. In conclusion, our studies 
provided novel insights into mechanisms of M2 protein in modulating host 
antiviral immunity and uncovered a new mechanism into biology and pathogenicity 
of influenza A virus.]]></TEXT>

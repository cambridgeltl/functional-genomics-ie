<TEXT><![CDATA[ZNF445 is a primary regulator of genomic imprinting.

Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process regulated by germline-derived DNA 
methylation, causing parental origin-specific monoallelic gene expression. Zinc 
finger protein 57 (ZFP57) is critical for maintenance of this epigenetic memory 
during post-fertilization reprogramming, yet incomplete penetrance of ZFP57 
mutations in humans and mice suggests additional effectors. We reveal that 
ZNF445/ZFP445, which we trace to the origins of imprinting, binds imprinting 
control regions (ICRs) in mice and humans. In mice, ZFP445 and ZFP57 act 
together, maintaining all but one ICR in vivo, whereas earlier embryonic 
expression of ZNF445 and its intolerance to loss-of-function mutations indicate 
greater importance in the maintenance of human imprints.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Phase Separation of Disease-Associated SHP2 Mutants Underlies MAPK 
Hyperactivation.

The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, 
plays an essential role in RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling 
during normal development. It has been perplexing as to why both enzymatically 
activating and inactivating mutations in PTPN11 result in human developmental 
disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we uncover a common 
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior shared by these 
disease-associated SHP2 mutants. SHP2 LLPS is mediated by the conserved 
well-folded PTP domain through multivalent electrostatic interactions and 
regulated by an intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanism through conformational 
changes. SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of SHP2 mutants, which 
boosts SHP2 PTP activity. Moreover, disease-associated SHP2 mutants can recruit 
and activate wild-type (WT) SHP2 in LLPS to promote MAPK activation. These 
results not only suggest that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism 
involved in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases but also provide 
evidence that PTP may be regulated by LLPS that can be therapeutically targeted.]]></TEXT>

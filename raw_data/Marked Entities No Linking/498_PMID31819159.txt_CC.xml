postischemic cardiac remodeling.

Chronic remodeling postmyocardial infarction consists in various maladaptive 
changes including interstitial fibrosis, cardiomyocyte death and mitochondrial 
dysfunction that lead to heart failure (HF). Reactive aldehydes such as 
4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) are critical mediators of mitochondrial dysfunction but 
the sources of mitochondrial 4-HNE in cardiac diseases together with its 
mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether the 
mitochondrial enzyme monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), which generates H2O2Â as a 
by-product of catecholamine metabolism, is a source of deleterious 4-HNE in HF. 
We found that MAO-A activation increased mitochondrial ROS and promoted local 
4-HNE production inside the mitochondria through cardiolipin peroxidation in 
primary cardiomyocytes. Deleterious effects of MAO-A/4-HNE on cardiac 
dysfunction were prevented by activation of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 
2 (ALDH2), the main enzyme for 4-HNE metabolism. Mechanistically, MAO-A-derived 
4-HNE bound to newly identified targets VDAC and MCU to promote ER-mitochondria 
contact sites and MCU higher-order complex formation. The resulting 
mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation participated in mitochondrial respiratory 
dysfunction and loss of membrane potential, as shown with the protective effects 
of the MCU inhibitor, RU360. Most interestingly, these findings were 
recapitulated in a chronic model of ischemic remodeling where pharmacological or 
genetic inhibition of MAO-A protected the mice from 4-HNE accumulation, MCU 
oligomer formation and Ca2+ overload, thus mitigating ventricular dysfunction. 
To our knowledge, these are the first evidences linking MAO-A activation to 
mitoCa2+ mishandling through local 4-HNE production, contributing to energetic 
failure and postischemic remodeling.]]></TEXT>

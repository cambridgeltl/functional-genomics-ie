<TEXT><![CDATA[A Thermostable mRNA Vaccine against COVID-19.

There is an urgent need for vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
because of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Among all approaches, a messenger 
RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine has emerged as a rapid and versatile platform to 
quickly respond to this challenge. Here, we developed a lipid 
nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the receptor binding domain 
(RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate (called ARCoV). Intramuscular 
immunization of ARCoV mRNA-LNP elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against 
SARS-CoV-2 as well as a Th1-biased cellular response in mice and non-human 
primates. Two doses of ARCoV immunization in mice conferred complete protection 
against the challenge of a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain. Additionally, ARCoV 
is manufactured as a liquid formulation and can be stored at room temperature 
for at least 1Â week. ARCoV is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical 
trials.]]></TEXT>

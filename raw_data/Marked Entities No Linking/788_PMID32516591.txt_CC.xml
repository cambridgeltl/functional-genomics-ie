<TEXT><![CDATA[Multi-phenotype CRISPR-Cas9 Screen Identifies p38 Kinase as a Target for 
Adoptive Immunotherapies.

T cells are central to all currently effective cancer immunotherapies, but the 
characteristics defining therapeutically effective anti-tumor T cells have not 
been comprehensively elucidated. Here, we delineate four phenotypic qualities of 
effective anti-tumor T cells: cell expansion, differentiation, oxidative stress, 
and genomic stress. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screen of primary T cells 
we measured the multi-phenotypic impact of disrupting 25 T cell receptor-driven 
kinases. We identified p38 kinase as a central regulator of all four phenotypes 
and uncovered transcriptional and antioxidant pathways regulated by p38 in 
T cells. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 improved the efficacy of mouse 
anti-tumor T cells and enhanced the functionalities of human tumor-reactive and 
gene-engineered T cells, paving the way for clinically relevant interventions.]]></TEXT>

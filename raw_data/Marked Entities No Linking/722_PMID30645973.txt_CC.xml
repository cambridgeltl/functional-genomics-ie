<TEXT><![CDATA[Gain Fat-Lose Metastasis: Converting Invasive Breast Cancer Cells into 
Adipocytes Inhibits Cancer Metastasis.

Cancer cell plasticity facilitates the development of therapy resistance and 
malignant progression. De-differentiation processes, such as an 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are known to enhance cellular 
plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that cancer cell plasticity can be exploited 
therapeutically by forcing the trans-differentiation of EMT-derived breast 
cancer cells into post-mitotic and functional adipocytes. Delineation of the 
molecular pathways underlying such trans-differentiation has motivated a 
combination therapy with MEK inhibitors and the anti-diabetic drug Rosiglitazone 
in various mouse models of murine and human breast cancer in vivo. This 
combination therapy provokes the conversion of invasive and disseminating cancer 
cells into post-mitotic adipocytes leading to the repression of primary tumor 
invasion and metastasis formation.]]></TEXT>

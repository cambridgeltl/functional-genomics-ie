Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway of select 
soluble proteins. Nearly one-third of the soluble proteins are predicted to be 
recognized by this pathway, yet only a minor fraction of this proteome has been 
identified as CMA substrates in cancer cells. Here, we undertook a quantitative 
multiplex mass spectrometry approach to study the proteome of isolated lysosomes 
in cancer cells during CMA-activated conditions. By integrating bioinformatics 
analyses, we identified and categorized proteins of multiple cellular pathways 
that were specifically targeted by CMA. Beyond verifying metabolic pathways, we 
show that multiple components involved in select biological processes, including 
cellular translation, was specifically targeted for degradation by CMA. In 
particular, several proteins of the translation initiation complex were 
identified as bona fide CMA substrates in multiple cancer cell lines of distinct 
origin and we show that CMA suppresses cellular translation. We further show 
that the identified CMA substrates display high expression in multiple primary 
cancers compared to their normal counterparts. Combined, these findings uncover 
cellular processes affected by CMA and reveal a new role for CMA in the control 
of translation in cancer cells.]]></TEXT>

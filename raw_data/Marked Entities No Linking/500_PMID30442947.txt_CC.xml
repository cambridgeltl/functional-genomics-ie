<TEXT><![CDATA[The anticonvulsive Phenhydan(®) suppresses extrinsic cell death.

Different forms of regulated cell death-like apoptosis and necroptosis 
contribute to the pathophysiology of clinical conditions including 
ischemia-reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, sepsis, and multiple 
sclerosis. In particular, the kinase activity of the receptor-interacting 
serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is crucial for cell fate in 
inflammation and cell death. However, despite its involvement in pathological 
conditions, no pharmacologic inhibitor of RIPK1-mediated cell death is currently 
in clinical use. Herein, we screened a collection of clinical compounds to 
assess their ability to modulate RIPK1-mediated cell death. Our small-scale 
screen identified the anti-epilepsy drug Phenhydan® as a potent inhibitor of 
death receptor-induced necroptosis and apoptosis. Accordingly, Phenhydan® 
blocked activation of necrosome formation/activation as well as death 
receptor-induced NF-κB signaling by influencing the membrane function of cells, 
such as lipid raft formation, thus exerting an inhibitory effect on 
pathophysiologic cell death processes. By targeting death receptor signaling, 
the already FDA-approved Phenhydan® may provide new therapeutic strategies for 
inflammation-driven diseases caused by aberrant cell death.]]></TEXT>

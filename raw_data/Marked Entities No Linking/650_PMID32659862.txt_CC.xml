<TEXT><![CDATA[A Genetic Map of the Response to DNA Damage in Human Cells.

The response to DNA damage is critical for cellular homeostasis, tumor 
suppression, immunity, and gametogenesis. In order to provide an unbiased and 
global view of the DNA damage response in human cells, we undertook 31 
CRISPR-Cas9 screens against 27 genotoxic agents in the retinal pigment 
epithelium-1 (RPE1) cell line. These screens identified 890 genes whose loss 
causes either sensitivity or resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Mining this 
dataset, we discovered that ERCC6L2 (which is mutated in a bone-marrow failure 
syndrome) codes for a canonical non-homologous end-joining pathway factor, that 
the RNA polymerase II component ELOF1 modulates the response to 
transcription-blocking agents, and that the cytotoxicity of the G-quadruplex 
ligand pyridostatin involves trapping topoisomerase II on DNA. This map of the 
DNA damage response provides a rich resource to study this fundamental cellular 
system and has implications for the development and use of genotoxic agents in 
cancer therapy.]]></TEXT>

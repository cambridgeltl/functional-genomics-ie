Recent studies suggest that defects in macroautophagy/autophagy contribute to 
the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythamatosus (SLE), especially in adaptive 
immunity. The occurrence and progression of lupus nephritis (LN) is the end 
result of complex interactions between regulation of immune responses and 
pathological process by renal resident cells, but there is still a lot of 
missing information for establishing the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis 
of LN, and as a therapy target. In our recent study, we observed that autophagy 
is activated in LN, especially in podocytes. Based on in vitro assays, many of 
the most important mediators of the disease - patients' sera, patients' IgG and 
IFNA/IFN-Î± - can induce autophagy in both murine and human podocytes, by 
reactive oxygen species production or MTORC1 inhibition; autophagy activation 
negatively associates with podocyte injury. With regard to intervention, 
autophagy activators can protect against podocyte injury, whereas autophagy 
inhibitors aggravate injury. Taken together, our findings suggest that podocyte 
autophagy is involved in lupus renal protection and may be a therapeutic target. 
These data shed new light on the role of rapamycin and autophagy inducers in the 
treatment of SLE. ]]></TEXT>

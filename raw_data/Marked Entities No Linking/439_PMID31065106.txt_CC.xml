<TEXT><![CDATA[Liver stage malaria infection is controlled by host regulators of lipid 
peroxidation.

The facets of host control during Plasmodium liver infection remain largely 
unknown. We find that the SLC7a11-GPX4 pathway, which has been associated with 
the production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and a form of 
cell death called ferroptosis, plays a critical role in control of Plasmodium 
liver stage infection. Specifically, blocking GPX4 or SLC7a11 dramatically 
reduces Plasmodium liver stage parasite infection. In contrast, blocking 
negative regulators of this pathway, NOX1 and TFR1, leads to an increase in 
liver stage infection. We have shown previously that increased levels of P53 
reduces Plasmodium LS burden in an apoptosis-independent manner. Here, we 
demonstrate that increased P53 is unable to control parasite burden during NOX1 
or TFR1 knockdown, or in the presence of ROS scavenging or when lipid 
peroxidation is blocked. Additionally, SLC7a11 inhibitors Erastin and Sorafenib 
reduce infection. Thus, blocking the host SLC7a11-GPX4 pathway serves to 
selectively elevate lipid peroxides in infected cells, which localize within the 
parasite and lead to the elimination of liver stage parasites.

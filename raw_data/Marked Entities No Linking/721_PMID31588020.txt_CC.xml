<TEXT><![CDATA[Pan-Cancer Landscape and Analysis of ERBB2 Mutations Identifies Poziotinib as a 
Clinically Active Inhibitor and Enhancer of T-DM1 Activity.

We characterized the landscape and drug sensitivity of ERBB2 (HER2) mutations in 
cancers. In 11 datasets (n = 211,726), ERBB2 mutational hotspots varied across 
25 tumor types. Common HER2 mutants yielded differential sensitivities to eleven 
EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro, and molecular dynamics 
simulations revealed that mutants with a reduced drug-binding pocket volume were 
associated with decreased affinity for larger TKIs. Overall, poziotinib was the 
most potent HER2 mutant-selective TKI tested. Phase II clinical testing in ERBB2 
exon 20-mutant non-small cell lung cancer resulted in a confirmed objective 
response rate of 42% in the first 12 evaluable patients. In pre-clinical models, 
poziotinib upregulated HER2 cell-surface expression and potentiated the activity 
of T-DM1, resulting in complete tumor regression with combination treatment.]]></TEXT>

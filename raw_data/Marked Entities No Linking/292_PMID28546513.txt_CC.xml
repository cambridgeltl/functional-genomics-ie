<TEXT><![CDATA[The SIAH E3 ubiquitin ligases promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling through mediating 
Wnt-induced Axin degradation.

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays essential roles in embryonic 
development and adult tissue homeostasis. Axin is a concentration-limiting 
factor responsible for the formation of the β-catenin destruction complex. Wnt 
signaling itself promotes the degradation of Axin. However, the underlying 
molecular mechanism and biological relevance of this targeting of Axin have not 
been elucidated. Here, we identify SIAH1/2 (SIAH) as the E3 ligase mediating 
Wnt-induced Axin degradation. SIAH proteins promote the ubiquitination and 
proteasomal degradation of Axin through interacting with a VxP motif in the 
GSK3-binding domain of Axin, and this function of SIAH is counteracted by GSK3 
binding to Axin. Structural analysis reveals that the Axin segment responsible 
for SIAH binding is also involved in GSK3 binding but adopts distinct 
conformations in Axin/SIAH and Axin/GSK3 complexes. Knockout of SIAH1 blocks 
Wnt-induced Axin ubiquitination and attenuates Wnt-induced β-catenin 
stabilization. Our data suggest that Wnt-induced dissociation of the Axin/GSK3 
complex allows SIAH to interact with Axin not associated with GSK3 and promote 
its degradation and that SIAH-mediated Axin degradation represents an important 
feed-forward mechanism to achieve sustained Wnt/β-catenin signaling.]]></TEXT>

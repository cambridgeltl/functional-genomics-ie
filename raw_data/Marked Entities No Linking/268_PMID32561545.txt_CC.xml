<TEXT><![CDATA[Human RTEL1 associates with Poldip3 to facilitate responses to replication 
stress and R-loop resolution.

RTEL1 helicase is a component of DNA repair and telomere maintenance 
machineries. While RTEL1's role in DNA replication is emerging, how RTEL1 
preserves genomic stability during replication remains elusive. Here we used a 
range of proteomic, biochemical, cell, and molecular biology and gene editing 
approaches to provide further insights into potential role(s) of RTEL1 in DNA 
replication and genome integrity maintenance. Our results from complementary 
human cell culture models established that RTEL1 and the PolÎ´ subunit Poldip3 
form a complex and are/function mutually dependent in chromatin binding after 
replication stress. Loss of RTEL1 and Poldip3 leads to marked R-loop 
accumulation that is confined to sites of active replication, enhances 
endogenous replication stress, and fuels ensuing genomic instability. The impact 
of depleting RTEL1 and Poldip3 is epistatic, consistent with our proposed 
concept of these two proteins operating in a shared pathway involved in DNA 
replication control under stress conditions. Overall, our data highlight a 
previously unsuspected role of RTEL1 and Poldip3 in R-loop suppression at 
genomic regions where transcription and replication intersect, with implications 
for human diseases including cancer.]]></TEXT>

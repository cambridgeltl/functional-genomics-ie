<TEXT><![CDATA[ATDC is required for the initiation of KRAS-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an aggressive disease driven by oncogenic 
KRAS and characterized by late diagnosis and therapeutic resistance. Here we 
show that deletion of the ataxia-telangiectasia group D-complementing (Atdc) 
gene, whose human homolog is up-regulated in the majority of pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, completely prevents PDA development in the context of oncogenic 
KRAS. ATDC is required for KRAS-driven acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and its 
progression to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). As a result, mice 
lacking ATDC are protected from developing PDA. Mechanistically, we show ATDC 
promotes ADM progression to PanIN through activation of Î²-catenin signaling and 
subsequent SOX9 up-regulation. These results provide new insight into PDA 
initiation and reveal ATDC as a potential target for preventing early 
tumor-initiating events.]]></TEXT>

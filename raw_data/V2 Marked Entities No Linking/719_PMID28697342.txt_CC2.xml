<TEXT><![CDATA[Tumor Evolution of Glioma-Intrinsic Gene Expression Subtypes Associates with 
Immunological Changes in the Microenvironment.

We leveraged IDH wild-type glioblastomas, derivative neurospheres, and 
single-cell gene expression profiles to define three tumor-intrinsic 
transcriptional subtypes designated as proneural, mesenchymal, and classical. 
Transcriptomic subtype multiplicity correlated with increased intratumoral 
heterogeneity and presence of tumor microenvironment. In silico cell sorting 
identified macrophages/microglia, CD4+ T lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the 
glioma microenvironment. NF1 deficiency resulted in increased tumor-associated 
macrophages/microglia infiltration. Longitudinal transcriptome analysis showed 
that expression subtype is retained in 55% of cases. Gene signature-based tumor 
microenvironment inference revealed a decrease in invading monocytes and a 
subtype-dependent increase in macrophages/microglia cells upon disease 
recurrence. Hypermutation at diagnosis or at recurrence associated with CD8+ 
TÂ cell enrichment. Frequency of M2 macrophages detection associated with 
short-term relapse after radiation therapy.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[A length-dependent evolutionarily conserved pathway controls nuclear export of 
circular RNAs.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated from many protein-coding genes. Most 
accumulate in the cytoplasm, but how circRNA localization or nuclear export is 
controlled remains unclear. Using RNAi screening, we found that depletion of the 
Drosophila DExH/D-box helicase Hel25E results in nuclear accumulation of long 
(>800-nucleotide), but not short, circRNAs. The human homologs of Hel25E 
similarly regulate circRNA localization, as depletion of UAP56 (DDX39B) or URH49 
(DDX39A) causes long and short circRNAs, respectively, to become enriched in the 
nucleus. These data suggest that the lengths of mature circRNAs are measured to 
dictate the mode of nuclear export.]]></TEXT>

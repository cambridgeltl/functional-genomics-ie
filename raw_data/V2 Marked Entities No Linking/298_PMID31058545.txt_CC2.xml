and repair at DNA breaks.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribed genes 
lead to inhibition of transcription. The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) 
complex plays a pivotal role in transcription inhibition at DSBs by stimulating 
proteasome-dependent eviction of RNAPII at these lesions. How DNA-PK triggers 
RNAPII eviction to inhibit transcription at DSBs remains unclear. Here we show 
that the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 associates with components of the DNA-PK 
and RNAPII complexes and is recruited to DSBs at RNAPII transcribed genes. In 
response to DSBs, WWP2 targets the RNAPII subunit RPB1 for K48-linked 
ubiquitylation, thereby driving DNA-PK- and proteasome-dependent eviction of 
RNAPII. The lack of WWP2 or expression of nonubiquitylatable RPB1 abrogates the 
binding of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factors, including DNA-PK and 
XRCC4/DNA ligase IV, and impairs DSB repair. These findings suggest that WWP2 
operates in a DNA-PK-dependent shutoff circuitry for RNAPII clearance that 
promotes DSB repair by protecting the NHEJ machinery from collision with the 
transcription machinery.]]></TEXT>

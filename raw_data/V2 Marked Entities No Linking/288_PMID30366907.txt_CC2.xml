nutrient stress.

Cells undergo metabolic adaptation during environmental changes by using 
evolutionarily conserved stress response programs. This metabolic homeostasis is 
exquisitely regulated, and its imbalance could underlie human pathological 
conditions. We report here that C9orf72, which is linked to the most common 
forms of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is a key regulator of lipid metabolism under 
stress. Loss of C9orf72 leads to an overactivation of starvation-induced lipid 
metabolism that is mediated by dysregulated autophagic digestion of lipids and 
increased de novo fatty acid synthesis. C9orf72 acts by promoting the lysosomal 
degradation of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), 
which in turn regulates autophagy-lysosomal functions and lipid metabolism. In 
ALS/FTD patient-derived neurons or tissues, a reduction in C9orf72 function is 
associated with dysregulation in the levels of CARM1, fatty acids, and NADPH 
oxidase NOX2. These results reveal a C9orf72-CARM1 axis in the control of 
stress-induced lipid metabolism and implicates epigenetic dysregulation in 
relevant human diseases.

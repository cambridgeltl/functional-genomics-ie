<TEXT><![CDATA[A Phase Ib Trial of Personalized Neoantigen Therapy Plus Anti-PD-1 in Patients 
with Advanced Melanoma, Non-small Cell Lung Cancer, or Bladder Cancer.

Neoantigens arise from mutations in cancer cells and are important targets of 
T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report the first open-label, phase 
Ib clinical trial of a personalized neoantigen-based vaccine, NEO-PV-01, in 
combination with PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small 
cell lung cancer, or bladder cancer. This analysis of 82 patients demonstrated 
that the regimen was safe, with no treatment-related serious adverse events 
observed. De novo neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were 
observed post-vaccination in all of the patients. The vaccine-induced T cells 
had a cytotoxic phenotype and were capable of trafficking to the tumor and 
mediating cell killing. In addition, epitope spread to neoantigens not included 
in the vaccine was detected post-vaccination. These data support the safety and 
immunogenicity of this regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors 
(Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02897765).]]></TEXT>

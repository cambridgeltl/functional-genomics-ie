<TEXT><![CDATA[The deubiquitinase JOSD2 is a positive regulator of glucose metabolism.

Cancer cells undergo complex metabolic alterations. The mechanisms underlying 
the tuning of cancer metabolism are under active investigation. Here, we 
identify the uncharacterized deubiquitinase JOSD2 as a positive regulator of 
cancer cell proliferation by displaying comprehensive effects on glucose 
catabolism. We found that JOSD2 directly controls a metabolic enzyme complex 
that includes Aldolase A, Phosphofructokinase-1 and Phosphoglycerate 
dehydrogenase, in vitro and in vivo. Further, JOSD2 expression, but not a 
catalytically inactive mutant, deubiquitinates and stabilizes the enzyme 
complex, thereby enhancing their activities and the glycolytic rate. This 
represents a selective JOSD2 feature that is not shared among other 
Machado-Joseph disease DUBs or observed in nontransformed cells. JOSD2 
deficiency displays cytostatic effects and reduces glycolysis in a broad 
spectrum of tumor cells of distinct origin and its expression correlates with 
poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer. Overall, our study provides 
evidence for a previously unknown biological mechanism in which JOSD2 integrates 
glucose and serine metabolism with potential therapeutic implications.]]></TEXT>

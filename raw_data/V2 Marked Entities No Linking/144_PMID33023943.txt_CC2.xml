Recruitment in Tumors.

The protein chaperone HSP70 is overexpressed in many cancers including 
colorectal cancer, where overexpression is associated with poor survival. We 
report here the creation of a uniquely acting HSP70 inhibitor (HSP70i) that 
targets multiple compartments in the cancer cell, including mitochondria. This 
inhibitor was mitochondria toxic and cytotoxic to colorectal cancer cells, but 
not to normal colon epithelial cells. Inhibition of HSP70 was efficacious as a 
single agent in primary and metastatic models of colorectal cancer and enabled 
identification of novel mitochondrial client proteins for HSP70. In a syngeneic 
colorectal cancer model, the inhibitor increased immune cell recruitment into 
tumors. Cells treated with the inhibitor secreted danger-associated molecular 
patterns (DAMP), including ATP and HMGB1, and functioned effectively as a tumor 
vaccine. Interestingly, the unique properties of this HSP70i in the disruption 
of mitochondrial function and the inhibition of proteostasis both contributed to 
DAMP release. This HSP70i constitutes a promising therapeutic opportunity in 
colorectal cancer and may exhibit antitumor activity against other tumor types. ]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Generation of Functional Human 3D Cortico-Motor Assembloids.

Neurons in the cerebral cortex connect through descending pathways to hindbrain 
and spinal cord to activate muscle and generate movement. Although components of 
this pathway have been previously generated and studied in vitro, the assembly 
of this multi-synaptic circuit has not yet been achieved with human cells. Here, 
we derive organoids resembling the cerebral cortex or the hindbrain/spinal cord 
and assemble them with human skeletal muscle spheroids to generate 3D 
cortico-motor assembloids. Using rabies tracing, calcium imaging, and 
patch-clamp recordings, we show that corticofugal neurons project and connect 
with spinal spheroids, while spinal-derived motor neurons connect with muscle. 
Glutamate uncaging or optogenetic stimulation of cortical spheroids triggers 
robust contraction of 3D muscle, and assembloids are morphologically and 
functionally intact for up to 10 weeks post-fusion. Together, this system 
highlights the remarkable self-assembly capacity of 3D cultures to form 
functional circuits that could be used to understand development and disease.]]></TEXT>

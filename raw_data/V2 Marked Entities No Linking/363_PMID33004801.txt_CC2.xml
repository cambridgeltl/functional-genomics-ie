BAFF supports B-cell survival and homeostasis by activating the NF-κB pathway. 
While NF-κB is also involved in the priming signal of NLRP3 inflammasome, the 
role of BAFF in NLRP3 inflammasome regulation is unknown. Here we report BAFF 
engagement to BAFF receptor elicited both priming and activating signals for 
NLRP3 inflammasomes in primary B cells and B lymphoma cell lines. This induction 
of NLRP3 inflammasomes by BAFF led to increased NLRP3 and IL-1β expression, 
caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptosis. Mechanistically, BAFF 
activated NLRP3 inflammasomes by promoting the association of cIAP-TRAF2 with 
components of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and by inducing Src activity-dependent ROS 
production and potassium ion efflux. B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation on the 
Lyn signaling pathway inhibited BAFF-induced Src activities and attenuated 
BAFF-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These findings reveal an additional 
function of BAFF in B-cell homeostasis that is associated with BCR activities.]]></TEXT>

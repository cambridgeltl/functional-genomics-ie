<TEXT><![CDATA[Conserved Interferon-γ Signaling Drives Clinical Response to Immune Checkpoint 
Blockade Therapy in Melanoma.

We analyze the transcriptome of baseline and on-therapy tumor biopsies from 101 
patients with advanced melanoma treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) alone or 
combined with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). We find that T cell infiltration and 
interferon-γ (IFN-γ) signaling signatures correspond most highly with clinical 
response to therapy, with a reciprocal decrease in cell-cycle and WNT signaling 
pathways in responding biopsies. We model the interaction in 58 human cell 
lines, where IFN-γ in vitro exposure leads to a conserved transcriptome response 
unless cells have IFN-γ receptor alterations. This conserved IFN-γ transcriptome 
response in melanoma cells serves to amplify the antitumor immune response. 
Therefore, the magnitude of the antitumor T cell response and the corresponding 
downstream IFN-γ signaling are the main drivers of clinical response or 
resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[The ubiquitin-specific protease USP8 directly deubiquitinates SQSTM1/p62 to 
suppress its autophagic activity.

SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) is a critical macroautophagy/autophagy receptor that 
promotes the formation and degradation of ubiquitinated aggregates. SQSTM1 can 
be modified by ubiquitination, and this modification modulates its autophagic 
activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning its reversible 
deubiquitination have never been described. Here we report that USP8 (ubiquitin 
specific peptidase 8) directly interacted with and deubiquitinated SQSTM1. USP8 
preferentially removed the lysine 11 (K11)-linked ubiquitin chains from SQSTM1. 
Moreover, USP8 deubiquitinated SQSTM1 principally at K420 within its 
ubiquitin-association (UBA) domain. Finally, USP8 inhibited SQSTM1 degradation 
and autophagic influx in cells with wild-type SQSTM1, but not its mutant with 
substitution of K420 with an arginine. Taken together, USP8 acts as a negative 
regulator of autophagy by deubiquitinating SQSTM1 at K420.]]></TEXT>

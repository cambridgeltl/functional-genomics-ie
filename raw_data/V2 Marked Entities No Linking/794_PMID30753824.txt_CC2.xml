B7-H3 via Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells.

The high expression across multiple tumor types and restricted expression in 
normal tissues make B7-H3 an attractive target for immunotherapy. We generated 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting B7-H3 (B7-H3.CAR-Ts) and found 
that B7-H3.CAR-Ts controlled the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 
ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma in vitro and in orthotopic and metastatic 
xenograft mouse models, which included patient-derived xenograft. We also found 
that 4-1BB co-stimulation promotes lower PD-1 expression in B7-H3.CAR-Ts, and 
superior antitumor activity when targeting tumor cells that constitutively 
expressed PD-L1. We took advantage of the cross-reactivity of the B7-H3.CAR with 
murine B7-H3, and found that B7-H3.CAR-Ts significantly controlled tumor growth 
in a syngeneic tumor model without evident toxicity. These findings support the 
clinical development of B7-H3.CAR-Ts.]]></TEXT>

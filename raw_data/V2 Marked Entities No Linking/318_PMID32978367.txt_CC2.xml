cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells via targeting LRRC1.

Exosomes are small endogenous membrane vesicles that can mediate cell 
communication by transferring genetic materials. Based on that, exosomes have 
always been discussed as a cargo carrier for microRNA (miRNA) transportation. 
Accumulating data have reported the inhibitory effects of microRNA-193a 
(miR-193a) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell progression. However, the 
mechanisms of miR-193a delivery to cancer cells and miR-193a in exosomes have 
not been explored clearly in NSCLC. Given that, this work aims to decode 
exosomal miR-193a in cisplatin (DDP) resistance of NSCLC cells. A549 and H1299 
cell lines were screened out and their parent cells and drug-resistant cells 
were co-cultured with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived 
exosomes (BMSC-Exo) that had been transfected with miR-193a mimic or si-LRRC1 to 
detect the colony formation, migration, apoptosis, invasion and proliferation of 
NSCLC cells. In vivo experiment was conducted to verify the in vitro results. 
BMSC-Exo with upregulated miR-193a and downregulated LRRC1 suppressed colony 
formation, invasion, proliferation and migration as well as advanced apoptosis 
of NSCLC parent cells and drug-resistant cells. BMSC-Exo combined with 
upregulated miR-193a reduced tumor volume and weight in mice with NSCLC. 
Functional studies report that BMSC-Exo shuffle miR-193a to suppress the colony 
formation, invasion, migration, and proliferation as well as advance apoptosis 
of NSCLC DDP-resistant cells via downregulating LRRC1.]]></TEXT>

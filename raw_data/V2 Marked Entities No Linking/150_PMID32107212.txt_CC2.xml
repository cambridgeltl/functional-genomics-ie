<TEXT><![CDATA[Dasatinib Is an Effective Treatment for Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma.

Recurrent hotspot (p.Gly17Val) mutations in RHOA encoding a small GTPase, 
together with loss-of-function mutations in TET2 encoding an epigenetic 
regulator, are genetic hallmarks of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). 
Mice expressing the p.Gly17Val RHOA mutant on a Tet2-null background succumbed 
to AITL-like T-cell lymphomas due to deregulated T-cell receptor (TCR) 
signaling. Using these mice to investigate therapeutics for AITL, we found that 
dasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor prolonged their survival through inhibition 
of hyperactivated TCR signaling. A phase I clinical trial study of dasatinib 
monotherapy in 5 patients with relapsed/refractory AITL was performed. Dasatinib 
was started at a dose of 100 mg/body once a day and continued until days 10-78 
(median day 58). All the evaluable patients achieved partial responses. Our 
findings suggest that AITL is highly dependent on TCR signaling and that 
dasatinib could be a promising candidate drug for AITL treatment.]]></TEXT>

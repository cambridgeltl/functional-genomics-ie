Pancreatic Cancer.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is driven by co-existing mutations in 
KRAS and TP53. However, how these mutations collaborate to promote this cancer 
is unknown. Here, we uncover sequence-specific changes in RNA splicing enforced 
by mutant p53 which enhance KRAS activity. Mutant p53 increases expression of 
splicing regulator hnRNPK to promote inclusion of cytosine-rich exons within 
GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), negative regulators of RAS family members. 
Mutant p53-enforced GAP isoforms lose cell membrane association, leading to 
heightened KRAS activity. Preventing cytosine-rich exon inclusion in mutant 
KRAS/p53 PDACs decreases tumor growth. Moreover, mutant p53 PDACs are sensitized 
to inhibition of splicing via spliceosome inhibitors. These data provide insight 
into co-enrichment of KRAS and p53 mutations and therapeutics targeting this 
mechanism in PDAC.]]></TEXT>

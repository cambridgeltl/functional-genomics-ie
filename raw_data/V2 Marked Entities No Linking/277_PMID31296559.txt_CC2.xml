degradation.

The orphan nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer partner) is a well-known 
transcriptional corepressor of bile acid and lipid metabolism in the liver; 
however, its function in other tissues is poorly understood. Here, we report an 
unexpected role for SHP in the exocrine pancreas as a modulator of the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. SHP expression is induced in acinar 
cells in response to ER stress and regulates the protein stability of the 
spliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s), a key mediator of ER stress 
response. Loss of SHP reduces XBP1s protein level and transcriptional activity, 
which in turn attenuates the ER stress response during the fasting-feeding 
cycle. Consequently, SHP-deficient mice also are more susceptible to 
cerulein-induced pancreatitis. Mechanistically, we show that SHP physically 
interacts with the transactivation domain of XBP1s, thereby inhibiting the 
polyubiquitination and degradation of XBP1s by the Cullin3-SPOP (speckle-type 
POZ protein) E3 ligase complex. Together, our data implicate SHP in governing ER 
homeostasis and identify a novel posttranslational regulatory mechanism for the 
key ER stress response effector XBP1.]]></TEXT>

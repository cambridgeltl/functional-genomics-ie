Cellular effects of ionizing radiation include oxidative damage to 
macromolecules, unfolded protein response (UPR) and metabolic imbalances. 
Oxidative stress and UPR have been shown to induce macroautophagy/autophagy in a 
context-dependent manner and are crucial factors in determining the fate of 
irradiated cells. However, an in-depth analysis of the relationship between 
radiation-induced damage and autophagy has not been explored. In the present 
study, we investigated the relationship between radiation-induced oxidative 
stress, UPR and autophagy in murine macrophage cells. A close association was 
observed between radiation-induced oxidative burst, UPR and induction of 
autophagy, with the possible involvement of EIF2AK3/PERK (eukaryotic translation 
initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3) and ERN1/IRE1 (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] to 
nucleus signaling 1). Inhibitors of either UPR or autophagy reduced the cell 
survival indicating the importance of these processes after radiation exposure. 
Moreover, modulation of autophagy affected lethality in the whole body 
irradiated C57BL/6 mouse. These findings indicate that radiation-induced 
autophagy is a pro-survival response initiated by oxidative stress and mediated 
by EIF2AK3 and ERN1.]]></TEXT>

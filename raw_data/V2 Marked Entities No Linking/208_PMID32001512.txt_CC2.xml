Oncogenic mutations in the RNA splicing factors SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 are the 
most frequent class of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and are also 
common in clonal hematopoiesis, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, and a variety of solid tumors. They cause genome-wide splicing 
alterations that affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA 
isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise a premature 
termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential targets of nonsense-mediated 
mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and 
NMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that 
SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on 
sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2 mutants enhance the deposition 
of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated 
molecular interactions. This architecture then favors the association of key NMD 
factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of EJC deposition by 
antisense oligonucleotides circumvents aberrant NMD promoted by mutant SRSF2, 
restoring the expression of PTC-containing transcript. Our study uncovered 
critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies, reflecting the 
regulation at multiple levels of RNA metabolism, from splicing to decay.

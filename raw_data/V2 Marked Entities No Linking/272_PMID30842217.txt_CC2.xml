exosome interaction.

The exosome functions in the degradation of diverse RNA species, yet how it is 
negatively regulated remains largely unknown. Here, we show that NRDE2 forms a 
1:1 complex with MTR4, a nuclear exosome cofactor critical for exosome 
recruitment, via a conserved MTR4-interacting domain (MID). Unexpectedly, NRDE2 
mainly localizes in nuclear speckles, where it inhibits MTR4 recruitment and RNA 
degradation, and thereby ensures efficient mRNA nuclear export. Structural and 
biochemical data revealed that NRDE2 interacts with MTR4's key residues, locks 
MTR4 in a closed conformation, and inhibits MTR4 interaction with the exosome as 
well as proteins important for MTR4 recruitment, such as the cap-binding complex 
(CBC) and ZFC3H1. Functionally, MID deletion results in the loss of self-renewal 
of mouse embryonic stem cells. Together, our data pinpoint NRDE2 as a nuclear 
exosome negative regulator that ensures mRNA stability and nuclear export.]]></TEXT>

and Mortality in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Cytokine Shock Syndromes.

COVID-19 is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and acute lung damage associated with patient mortality. While multiple 
inflammatory cytokines are produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 
infection, we found that only the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induced 
inflammatory cell death characterized by inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. 
Mechanistically, TNF-α and IFN-γ co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, 
inducing nitric oxide production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. 
TNF-α and IFN-γ caused a lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue 
damage and inflammation of COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice 
from this pathology and death. Furthermore, treating with neutralizing 
antibodies against TNF-α and IFN-γ protected mice from mortality during 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine 
shock. Collectively, our findings suggest that blocking the cytokine-mediated 
inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified here may benefit patients 
with COVID-19 or other infectious and autoinflammatory diseases by limiting 
tissue damage/inflammation.

invasion of lung adenocarcinoma by binding to YBX1.

There is increasing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important 
roles in human tumorigenesis. By using publicly available expression profiling 
data from lung adenocarcinoma and integrating bioinformatics analysis, we 
screened a lncRNA, LINC00472. LINC00472 expression in lung adenocarcinoma 
tissues was significantly lower and tightly associated with patient prognosis 
and TNM clinical stages in lung adenocarcinoma. LINC00472 also inhibited lung 
adenocarcinoma cell migration and invasion and increased cell stiffness and 
adhesion. RNA pull down and RIP assays identified that LINC00472 interacted with 
the transcription factor Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1), which partially 
reversed the inhibition of cell migration and invasion and increased 
LINC00472-induced cell stiffness and adhesion. LINC00472 also regulated the 
density and integrity of F-actin in A549 and PC-9 cells possibly via YBX1. 
LINC00472 inhibited the cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes 
via the modulation of YBX1. These results indicated that LINC00472 inhibited the 
cell EMT process by binding to YBX1, and affected the mechanical properties of 
the cell, ultimately inhibited its ability to invade and metastasize. 
Collectively, the present study provides the first evidence that LINC00472 
changes the mechanical properties and inhibits the invasion and metastasis of 
lung adenocarcinoma cells.]]></TEXT>

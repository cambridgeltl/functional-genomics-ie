alleviates intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury.

Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening disorder with high rates of 
morbidity and mortality. Reactive oxygen species and epithelial apoptosis are 
involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Ferroptosis, an 
iron-dependent non-apoptotic form of cell death, mediates its effects in part by 
promoting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The inhibition of 
ferroptosis decreases clinical symptoms in experimental models of 
ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal failure and heart injury. This study 
investigated the roles of inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 
(iASPP) and Nrf2 in ferroptosis and their potential therapeutic effects in 
intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury. Intestinal 
ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI was induced in wild-type and Nrf2-/- mice. The 
mice were treated with erastin followed by liproxstatin-1. Ferroptosis-related 
factors in mice with ischemia/reperfusion-induced acute lung injury or in mouse 
lung epithelial-2 cells with hypoxia/regeneration (HR)-induced ALI were measured 
by western blotting, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence. Ferroptosis 
contributed to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI in vivo. iASPP 
inhibited ferroptosis and alleviated intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced 
acute lung injury, and iASPP-mediated protection against 
ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI was dependent on Nrf2 signaling. HR-induced 
acute lung injury enhanced ferroptosis in vitro in mouse lung epithelial-2 
cells, and ferroptosis was modulated after the enhancement of intestinal 
ischemia/reperfusion in Nrf2-/- mice. iASPP mediated its protective effects 
against acute lung injury through the Nrf2/HIF-1/TF signaling pathway. 
Ferroptosis contributes to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion-induced ALI, and 
iASPP treatment inhibits ferroptosis in part via Nrf2. These findings indicate 
the therapeutic potential of iASPP for treating ischemia/reperfusion-induced 
ALI.

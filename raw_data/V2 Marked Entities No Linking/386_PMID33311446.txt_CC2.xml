<TEXT><![CDATA[FZD5 contributes to TNBC proliferation, DNA damage repair and stemness.

Chemotherapy currently remains the standard treatment for triple-negative breast 
cancer (TNBC). However, TNBC frequently develop chemoresistance, which is 
responsible for cancer recurrence and distal metastasis. Both DNA damage repair 
and stemness are related to chemoresistance. FZD5, a member in Frizzled family, 
was identified to be preferentially expressed in TNBC, and associated with 
unfavorable prognosis. Loss and gain of function studies revealed that FZD5 
contributed to TNBC cell G1/S transition, DNA replication, DNA damage repair, 
survival, and stemness. Mechanistically, transcription factor FOXM1, which 
promoted BRCA1 and BIRC5 transcription, acted as a downstream effecter of FZD5 
signaling. FOXM1 overexpression in FZD5-deficient/low TNBC cells induced 
FZD5-associated phenotype. Finally, Wnt7B, a specific ligand for FZD5, was shown 
to be involved in cell proliferation, DNA damage repair, and stemness. Taken 
together, FZD5 is a novel target for the development of therapeutic strategies 
to overcome chemoresistance and prevent recurrence in TNBC.]]></TEXT>

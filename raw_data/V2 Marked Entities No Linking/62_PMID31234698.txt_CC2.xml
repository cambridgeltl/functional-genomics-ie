<TEXT><![CDATA[Autophagic death of neural stem cells mediates chronic stress-induced decline of 
adult hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive deficits.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is generally regarded as a cytoprotective mechanism, 
and it remains a matter of controversy whether autophagy can cause cell death in 
mammals. Here, we show that chronic restraint stress suppresses adult 
hippocampal neurogenesis in mice by inducing autophagic cell death (ACD) of 
hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). We generated NSC-specific, inducible Atg7 
conditional knockout mice and found that they had an intact number of NSCs and 
neurogenesis level under chronic restraint stress and were resilient to stress- 
or corticosterone-induced cognitive and mood deficits. Corticosterone treatment 
of adult hippocampal NSC cultures induced ACD via SGK3 (serum/glucocorticoid 
regulated kinase 3) without signs of apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that ACD 
is biologically important in a mammalian system in vivo and would be an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention for psychological stress-induced 
disorders.]]></TEXT>

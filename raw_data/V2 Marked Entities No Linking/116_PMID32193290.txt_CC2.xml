<TEXT><![CDATA[Drug Sensitivity and Allele Specificity of First-Line Osimertinib Resistance 
EGFR Mutations.

Osimertinib, a mutant-specific third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 
is emerging as the preferred first-line therapy for EGFR-mutant lung cancer, yet 
resistance inevitably develops in patients. We modeled acquired resistance to 
osimertinib in transgenic mouse models of EGFRL858R -induced lung adenocarcinoma 
and found that it is mediated largely through secondary mutations in EGFR-either 
C797S or L718V/Q. Analysis of circulating free DNA data from patients revealed 
that L718Q/V mutations almost always occur in the context of an L858R driver 
mutation. Therapeutic testing in mice revealed that both erlotinib and afatinib 
caused regression of osimertinib-resistant C797S-containing tumors, whereas only 
afatinib was effective on L718Q mutant tumors. Combination first-line 
osimertinib plus erlotinib treatment prevented the emergence of secondary 
mutations in EGFR. These findings highlight how knowledge of the specific 
characteristics of resistance mutations is important for determining potential 
subsequent treatment approaches and suggest strategies to overcome or prevent 
osimertinib resistance in vivo. ]]></TEXT>

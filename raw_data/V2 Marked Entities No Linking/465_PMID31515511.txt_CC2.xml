Acute liver injury is commonly caused by bacterial endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS), and by drug overdose such as acetaminophen (APAP). The exact role of 
epigenetic modification in acute liver injury remains elusive. Here, we 
investigated the role of histone methyltransferase G9a in LPS- or APAP 
overdose-induced acute liver injury. Under D-galactosamine sensitization, 
liver-specific G9a-deficient mice (L-G9a-/-) exhibited 100% mortality after LPS 
injection, while the control and L-G9a+/- littermates showed very mild 
mortality. Moreover, abrogation of hepatic G9a or inhibiting the 
methyltransferase activity of G9a aggravated LPS-induced liver damage. 
Similarly, under sublethal APAP overdose, L-G9a-/- mice displayed more severe 
liver injury. Mechanistically, ablation of G9a inhibited H3K9me1 levels at the 
promoters of Gstp1/2, two liver detoxifying enzymes, and consequently suppressed 
their transcription. Notably, treating L-G9a-/- mice with recombinant mouse 
GSTP1 reversed the LPS- or APAP overdose-induced liver damage. Taken together, 
we identify a novel beneficial role of G9a-GSTP1 axis in protecting against 
acute liver injury.]]></TEXT>

Progression and Metastasis.

Colorectal and lung cancers account for one-third of all cancer-related deaths 
worldwide. Previous studies suggested that metadherin (MTDH) is involved in the 
development of colorectal and lung cancers. However, how MTDH regulates the 
pathogenesis of these cancers remains largely unknown. Using genetically 
modified mouse models of spontaneous colorectal and lung cancers, we found that 
MTDH promotes cancer progression by facilitating Wnt activation and by inducing 
cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion, respectively. Moreover, we developed locked nucleic 
acid-modified (LNA) MTDH antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that effectively and 
specifically suppress MTDH expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatments with MTDH 
ASOs in mouse models significantly attenuated progression and metastasis of 
colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. Our study opens a new avenue for 
developing therap]]></TEXT>

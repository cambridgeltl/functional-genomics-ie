The fusion of autophagosomes and endosomes/lysosomes, also called autophagosome 
maturation, ensures the degradation of autophagic cargoes. It is an important 
regulatory step of the macroautophagy/autophagy process. STX17 is the key 
autophagosomal SNARE protein that mediates autophagosome maturation. Here, we 
report that the acetylation of STX17 regulates its SNARE activity and autophagic 
degradation. The histone acetyltransferase CREBBP/CBP and the deacetylase HDAC2 
specifically regulate the acetylation of STX17. In response to cell starvation 
and MTORC1 inhibition, the inactivation of CREBBP leads to the deacetylation of 
STX17 at its SNARE domain. This deacetylation promotes the interaction between 
STX17 and SNAP29 and the formation of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE complex with 
no effect on the recruitment of STX17 to autophagosomal membranes. Deacetylation 
of STX17 also enhances the interaction between STX17 and the tethering complex 
HOPS, thereby further promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Our study 
suggests a mechanism by which acetylation regulates the late-stage of autophagy, 
and possibly other STX17-related intracellular membrane fusion 
events.]]></TEXT>

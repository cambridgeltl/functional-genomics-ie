<TEXT><![CDATA[Distinct Immune Cell Populations Define Response to Anti-PD-1 Monotherapy and 
Anti-PD-1/Anti-CTLA-4 Combined Therapy.

Cancer immunotherapies provide survival benefits in responding patients, but 
many patients fail to respond. Identifying the biology of treatment response and 
resistance are a priority to optimize drug selection and improve patient 
outcomes. We performed transcriptomic and immune profiling on 158 tumor biopsies 
from melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy (n = 63) or combined 
anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 (n = 57). These data identified activated T cell 
signatures and T cell populations in responders to both treatments. Further mass 
cytometry analysis identified an EOMES+CD69+CD45RO+ effector memory T cell 
phenotype that was significantly more abundant in responders to combined 
immunotherapy compared with non-responders (n = 18). The gene expression profile 
of this population was associated with longer progression-free survival in 
patients treated with single agent and greater tumor shrinkage in both 
treatments.]]></TEXT>

MST1/2-dependent apoptosis.

Cancer cells balance with the equilibrium of cell death and growth to expand and 
metastasize. The activity of mammalian sterile20-like kinases (MST1/2) has been 
linked to apoptosis and tumor suppression via YAP/Hippo pathway-independent and 
-dependent mechanisms. Using a kinase substrate screen, we identified here MST1 
and MST2 among the top substrates for fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 
(FGFR4). In COS-1 cells, MST1 was phosphorylated at Y433 residue in an FGFR4 
kinase activity-dependent manner, as assessed by mass spectrometry. Blockade of 
this phosphorylation by Y433F mutation induced MST1 activation, as indicated by 
increased threonine phosphorylation of MST1/2, and the downstream substrate 
MOB1, in FGFR4-overexpressing T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. 
Importantly, the specific knockdown or short-term inhibition of FGFR4 in 
endogenous models of human HER2+ breast cancer cells likewise led to increased 
MST1/2 activation, in conjunction with enhanced MST1 nuclear localization and 
generation of N-terminal cleaved and autophosphorylated MST1. Unexpectedly, MST2 
was also essential for this MST1/N activation and coincident apoptosis 
induction, although these two kinases, as well as YAP, were differentially 
regulated in the breast cancer models analyzed. Moreover, pharmacological FGFR4 
inhibition specifically sensitized the HER2+ MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, not 
only to HER2/EGFR and AKT/mTOR inhibitors, but also to clinically relevant 
apoptosis modulators. In TCGA cohort, FGFR4 overexpression correlated with 
abysmal HER2+ breast carcinoma patient outcome. Therefore, our results uncover a 
clinically relevant, targetable mechanism of FGFR4 oncogenic activity via 
suppression of the stress-associated MST1/2-induced apoptosis machinery in tumor 
cells with prominent HER/ERBB and FGFR4 signaling-driven proliferation.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[The Global Phosphorylation Landscape of SARS-CoV-2 Infection.

The causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected millions and 
killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, highlighting an urgent need to 
develop antiviral therapies. Here we present a quantitative mass 
spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 
cells, revealing dramatic rewiring of phosphorylation on host and viral 
proteins. SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted casein kinase II (CK2) and p38 MAPK 
activation, production of diverse cytokines, and shutdown of mitotic kinases, 
resulting in cell cycle arrest. Infection also stimulated a marked induction of 
CK2-containing filopodial protrusions possessing budding viral particles. 
Eighty-seven drugs and compounds were identified by mapping global 
phosphorylation profiles to dysregulated kinases and pathways. We found 
pharmacologic inhibition of the p38, CK2, CDK, AXL, and PIKFYVE kinases to 
possess antiviral efficacy, representing potential COVID-19 therapies.

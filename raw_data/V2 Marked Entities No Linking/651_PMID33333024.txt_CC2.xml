Coronaviruses.

The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that cause disease in humans ranging 
from mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress 
syndrome. Finding host factors common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate 
the development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. 
Here, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as 
well as two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. 
This approach correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for 
SARS-CoV-2), aminopeptidase N (for 229E), and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). 
Additionally, we identified phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and 
cholesterol homeostasis as critical host pathways supporting infection by all 
three coronaviruses. By contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique 
to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 
kinases and cholesterol homeostasis reduced replication of all three 
coronaviruses. These findings offer important insights for the understanding of 
the coronavirus life cycle and the development of host-directed therapies.]]></TEXT>

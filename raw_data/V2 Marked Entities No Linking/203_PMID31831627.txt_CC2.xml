<TEXT><![CDATA[Induction of AP-1 by YAP/TAZ contributes to cell proliferation and organ growth.

Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its homolog transcriptional coactivator with 
PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are key effectors of the Hippo pathway to control cell 
growth and organ size, of which dysregulation yields to tumorigenesis or 
hypertrophy. Upon activation, YAP/TAZ translocate into the nucleus and bind to 
TEAD transcription factors to promote transcriptional programs for proliferation 
or cell specification. Immediate early genes, represented by AP-1 complex, are 
rapidly induced and control later-phase transcriptional program to play key 
roles in tumorigenesis and organ maintenance. Here, we report that YAP/TAZ 
directly promote FOS transcription that in turn contributes to the biological 
function of YAP/TAZ. YAP/TAZ bind to the promoter region of FOS to stimulate its 
transcription. Deletion of YAP/TAZ blocks the induction of immediate early genes 
in response to mitogenic stimuli. FOS induction contributes to expression of 
YAP/TAZ downstream target genes. Genetic deletion or chemical inhibition of AP-1 
suppresses growth of YAP-driven cancer cells, such as Lats1/2-deficient cancer 
cells as well as GÎ±q/11 mutated uveal melanoma. Furthermore, AP-1 inhibition 
almost completely abrogates the hepatomegaly induced by YAP overexpression. Our 
findings reveal a feed-forward interplay between immediate early transcription 
of AP-1 and Hippo pathway function.]]></TEXT>

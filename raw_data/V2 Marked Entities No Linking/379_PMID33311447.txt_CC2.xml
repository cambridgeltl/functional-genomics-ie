SEMG1/2 augment energy metabolism of tumor cells.

SEMG1 and SEMG2 genes belong to the family of cancer-testis antigens (CTAs), 
whose expression normally is restricted to male germ cells but is often restored 
in various malignancies. High levels of SEMG1 and SEMG2 expression are detected 
in prostate, renal, and lung cancer as well as hemoblastosis. However, the 
functional importance of both SEMGs proteins in human neoplasms is still largely 
unknown. In this study, by using a combination of the bioinformatics and various 
cellular and molecular assays, we have demonstrated that SEMG1 and SEMG2 are 
frequently expressed in lung cancer clinical samples and cancer cell lines of 
different origins and are negatively associated with the survival rate of cancer 
patients. Using the pull-down assay followed by LC-MS/MS mass-spectrometry, we 
have identified 119 proteins associated with SEMG1 and SEMG2. Among the SEMGs 
interacting proteins we noticed two critical glycolytic enzymes-pyruvate kinase 
M2 (PKM2) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Importantly, we showed that SEMGs 
increased the protein level and activity of both PKM2 and LDHA. Further, both 
SEMGs increased the membrane mitochondrial potential (MMP), glycolysis, 
respiration, and ROS production in several cancer cell lines. Taken together, 
these data provide first evidence that SEMGs can up-regulate the energy 
metabolism of cancer cells, exemplifying their oncogenic features.

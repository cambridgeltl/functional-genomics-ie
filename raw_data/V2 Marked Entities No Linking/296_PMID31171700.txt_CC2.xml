<TEXT><![CDATA[Phase separation of Polycomb-repressive complex 1 is governed by a charged 
disordered region of CBX2.

Mammalian development requires effective mechanisms to repress genes whose 
expression would generate inappropriately specified cells. The 
Polycomb-repressive complex 1 (PRC1) family complexes are central to maintaining 
this repression. These include a set of canonical PRC1 complexes, each of which 
contains four core proteins, including one from the CBX family. These complexes 
have been shown previously to reside in membraneless organelles called Polycomb 
bodies, leading to speculation that canonical PRC1 might be found in a separate 
phase from the rest of the nucleus. We show here that reconstituted PRC1 readily 
phase-separates into droplets in vitro at low concentrations and physiological 
salt conditions. This behavior is driven by the CBX2 subunit. Point mutations in 
an internal domain of Cbx2 eliminate phase separation. These same point 
mutations eliminate the formation of puncta in cells and have been shown 
previously to eliminate nucleosome compaction in vitro and generate axial 
patterning defects in mice. Thus, the domain of CBX2 that is important for phase 
separation is the same domain shown previously to be important for chromatin 
compaction and proper development, raising the possibility of a mechanistic or 
evolutionary link between these activities.]]></TEXT>

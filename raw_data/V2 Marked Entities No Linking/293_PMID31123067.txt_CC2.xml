<TEXT><![CDATA[Loss of TLE3 promotes the mitochondrial program in beige adipocytes and improves 
glucose metabolism.

Prolonged cold exposure stimulates the recruitment of beige adipocytes within 
white adipose tissue. Beige adipocytes depend on mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation to drive thermogenesis. The transcriptional mechanisms that 
promote remodeling in adipose tissue during the cold are not well understood. 
Here we demonstrate that the transcriptional coregulator transducin-like 
enhancer of split 3 (TLE3) inhibits mitochondrial gene expression in beige 
adipocytes. Conditional deletion of TLE3 in adipocytes promotes mitochondrial 
oxidative metabolism and increases energy expenditure, thereby improving glucose 
control. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, we found that 
TLE3 occupies distal enhancers in proximity to nuclear-encoded mitochondrial 
genes and that many of these binding sites are also enriched for early B-cell 
factor (EBF) transcription factors. TLE3 interacts with EBF2 and blocks its 
ability to promote the thermogenic transcriptional program. Collectively, these 
studies demonstrate that TLE3 regulates thermogenic gene expression in beige 
adipocytes through inhibition of EBF2 transcriptional activity. Inhibition of 
TLE3 may provide a novel therapeutic approach for obesity and diabetes.]]></TEXT>

autophagy and autolysosomal targeting.

Infection and inflammation are able to induce diet-independent Na+-accumulation 
without commensurate water retention in afflicted tissues, which favors the 
pro-inflammatory activation of mouse macrophages and augments their 
antibacterial and antiparasitic activity. While Na+-boosted host defense against 
the protozoan parasite Leishmania major is mediated by increased expression of 
the leishmanicidal NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2, inducible), the molecular 
mechanisms underpinning this enhanced antibacterial defense of mouse macrophages 
with high Na+ (HS) exposure are unknown. Here, we provide evidence that 
HS-increased antibacterial activity against E. coli was neither dependent on 
NOS2 nor on the phagocyte oxidase. In contrast, HS-augmented antibacterial 
defense hinged on HIF1A (hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit)-dependent 
increased autophagy, and NFAT5 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 5)-dependent 
targeting of intracellular E. coli to acidic autolysosomal compartments. 
Overall, these findings suggest that the autolysosomal compartment is a novel 
target of Na+-modulated cell autonomous innate immunity. ]]></TEXT>

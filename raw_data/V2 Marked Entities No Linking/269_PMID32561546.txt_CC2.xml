<TEXT><![CDATA[Collapse of the hepatic gene regulatory network in the absence of FoxA factors.

The FoxA transcription factors are critical for liver development through their 
pioneering activity, which initiates a highly complex regulatory network thought 
to become progressively resistant to the loss of any individual hepatic 
transcription factor via mutual redundancy. To investigate the dispensability of 
FoxA factors for maintaining this regulatory network, we ablated all FoxA genes 
in the adult mouse liver. Remarkably, loss of FoxA caused rapid and massive 
reduction in the expression of critical liver genes. Activity of these genes was 
reduced back to the low levels of the fetal prehepatic endoderm stage, leading 
to necrosis and lethality within days. Mechanistically, we found FoxA proteins 
to be required for maintaining enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, 
nucleosome positioning, and binding of HNF4Î±. Thus, the FoxA factors act 
continuously, guarding hepatic enhancer activity throughout adult life.]]></TEXT>

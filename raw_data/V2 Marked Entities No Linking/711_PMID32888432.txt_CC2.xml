<TEXT><![CDATA[Integrated Omics of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

We integrate the genomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics of 480 clinical 
tissues from 146 patients in a Chinese colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort, among 
which 70 had metastatic CRC (mCRC). Proteomic profiling differentiates three CRC 
subtypes characterized by distinct clinical prognosis and molecular signatures. 
Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of primary tumors alone successfully 
distinguishes cases with metastasis. Metastatic tissues exhibit high 
similarities with primary tumors at the genetic but not the proteomic level, and 
kinase network analysis reveals significant heterogeneity between primary 
colorectal tumors and their liver metastases. In vivo xenograft-based drug tests 
using 31 primary and metastatic tumors show personalized responses, which could 
also be predicted by kinase-substrate network analysis no matter whether tumors 
carry mutations in the drug-targeted genes. Our study provides a valuable 
resource for better understanding of mCRC and has potential for clinical 
application.]]></TEXT>

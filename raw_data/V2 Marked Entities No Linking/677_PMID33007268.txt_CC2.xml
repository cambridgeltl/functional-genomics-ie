<TEXT><![CDATA[Regulation of Collective Metastasis by Nanolumenal Signaling.

Collective metastasis is defined as the cohesive migration and metastasis of 
multicellular tumor cell clusters. Disrupting various cell adhesion genes 
markedly reduces cluster formation and colonization efficiency, yet the 
downstream signals transmitted by clustering remain largely unknown. Here, we 
use mouse and human breast cancer models to identify a collective signal 
generated by tumor cell clusters supporting metastatic colonization. We show 
that tumor cell clusters produce the growth factor epigen and concentrate it 
within nanolumina-intercellular compartments sealed by cell-cell junctions and 
lined with microvilli-like protrusions. Epigen knockdown profoundly reduces 
metastatic outgrowth and switches clusters from a proliferative to a collective 
migratory state. Tumor cell clusters from basal-like 2, but not 
mesenchymal-like, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines have increased epigen 
expression, sealed nanolumina, and impaired outgrowth upon nanolumenal junction 
disruption. We propose that nanolumenal signaling could offer a therapeutic 
target for aggressive metastatic breast cancers.]]></TEXT>

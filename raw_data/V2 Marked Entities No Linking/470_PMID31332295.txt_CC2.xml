axis.

Quiescent satellite cells (SCs) that are activated to produce numerous myoblasts 
underpin the complete healing of damaged skeletal muscle. How cell-autonomous 
regulatory mechanisms modulate the balance among cells committed to 
differentiation and those committed to self-renewal to maintain the stem cell 
pool remains poorly explored. Here, we show that miR-31 inactivation compromises 
muscle regeneration in adult mice by impairing the expansion of myoblasts. 
miR-31 is pivotal for SC proliferation, and its deletion promotes asymmetric 
cell fate segregation of proliferating cells, resulting in enhanced myogenic 
commitment and re-entry into quiescence. Further analysis revealed that miR-31 
posttranscriptionally suppresses interleukin 34 (IL34) mRNA, the protein product 
of which activates JAK-STAT3 signaling required for myogenic progression. IL34 
inhibition rescues the regenerative deficiency of miR-31 knockout mice. Our 
results provide evidence that targeting miR-31 or IL34 activities in SCs could 
be used to counteract the functional exhaustion of SCs in pathological 
conditions.]]></TEXT>

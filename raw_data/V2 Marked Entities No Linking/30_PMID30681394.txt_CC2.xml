<TEXT><![CDATA[The macrophage-specific V-ATPase subunit ATP6V0D2 restricts inflammasome 
activation and bacterial infection by facilitating autophagosome-lysosome 
fusion.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is a conserved ubiquitous pathway that performs diverse 
roles in health and disease. Although many key, widely expressed proteins that 
regulate autophagosome formation followed by lysosomal fusion have been 
identified, the possibilities of cell-specific elements that contribute to the 
autophagy fusion machinery have not been explored. Here we show that a 
macrophage-specific isoform of the vacuolar ATPase protein ATP6V0D2/subunit d2 
is dispensable for lysosome acidification, but promotes the completion of 
autophagy via promotion of autophagosome-lysosome fusion through its interaction 
with STX17 and VAMP8. Atp6v0d2-deficient macrophages have augmented 
mitochondrial damage, enhanced inflammasome activation and reduced clearance of 
Salmonella typhimurium. The susceptibility of atp6v0d2 knockout mice to 
DSS-induced colitis and Salmonella typhimurium-induced death, highlights the in 
vivo significance of ATP6V0D2-mediated autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Together, 
our data identify ATP6V0D2 as a key component of macrophage-specific 
autophagosome-lysosome fusion machinery maintaining macrophage organelle 
homeostasis and, in turn, limiting both inflammation and bacterial infection.]]></TEXT>

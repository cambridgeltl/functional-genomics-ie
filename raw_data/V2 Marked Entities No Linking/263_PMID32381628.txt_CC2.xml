<TEXT><![CDATA[Transcriptional down-regulation of metabolic genes by Gdown1 ablation induces 
quiescent cell re-entry into the cell cycle.

Liver regeneration and metabolism are highly interconnected. Here, we show that 
hepatocyte-specific ablation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II)-associated Gdown1 
leads to down-regulation of highly expressed genes involved in plasma protein 
synthesis and metabolism, a concomitant cell cycle re-entry associated with 
induction of cell cycle-related genes (including cyclin D1), and up-regulation 
of p21 through activation of p53 signaling. In the absence of p53, 
Gdown1-deficient hepatocytes show a severe dysregulation of cell cycle 
progression, with incomplete mitoses, and a premalignant-like transformation. 
Mechanistically, Gdown1 is associated with elongating Pol II on the highly 
expressed genes and its ablation leads to reduced Pol II recruitment to these 
genes, suggesting that Pol II redistribution may facilitate hepatocyte re-entry 
into the cell cycle. These results establish an important physiological function 
for a Pol II regulatory factor (Gdown1) in the maintenance of normal liver cell 
transcription through constraints on cell cycle re-entry of quiescent 
hepatocytes.]]></TEXT>

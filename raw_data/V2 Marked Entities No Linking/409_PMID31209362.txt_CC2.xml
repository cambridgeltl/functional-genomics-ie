acetylation-phosphorylation.

Both the stress-response protein, SIRT1, and the cell cycle checkpoint kinase, 
CHK2, play critical roles in aging and cancer via the modulation of cellular 
homeostasis and the maintenance of genomic integrity. However, the underlying 
mechanism linking the two pathways remains elusive. Here, we show that SIRT1 
functions as a modifier of CHK2 in cell cycle control. Specifically, SIRT1 
interacts with CHK2 and deacetylates it at lysine 520 residue, which suppresses 
CHK2 phosphorylation, dimerization, and thus activation. SIRT1 depletion induces 
CHK2 hyperactivation-mediated cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death. In 
vivo, genetic deletion of Chk2 rescues the neonatal lethality of Sirt1-/- mice, 
consistent with the role of SIRT1 in preventing CHK2 hyperactivation. Together, 
these results suggest that CHK2 mediates the function of SIRT1 in cell cycle 
progression, and may provide new insights into modulating cellular homeostasis 
and maintaining genomic integrity in the prevention of aging and cancer.

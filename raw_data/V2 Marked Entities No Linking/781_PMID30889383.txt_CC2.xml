Poly(ADP-Ribose) Glycohydrolase Inhibitors.

Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) have demonstrated efficacy in 
women with BRCA-mutant ovarian cancer. However, only 15%-20% of ovarian cancers 
harbor BRCA mutations, therefore additional therapies are required. Here, we 
show that a subset of ovarian cancer cell lines and exÂ vivo models derived from 
patient biopsies are sensitive to a poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) 
inhibitor. Sensitivity is due to underlying DNA replication vulnerabilities that 
cause persistent fork stalling and replication catastrophe. PARG inhibition is 
synthetic lethal with inhibition of DNA replication factors, allowing additional 
models to be sensitized by CHK1 inhibitors. Because PARG and PARP inhibitor 
sensitivity are mutually exclusive, our observations demonstrate that PARG 
inhibitors have therapeutic potential to complement PARP inhibitor strategies in 
the treatment of ovarian cancer.]]></TEXT>

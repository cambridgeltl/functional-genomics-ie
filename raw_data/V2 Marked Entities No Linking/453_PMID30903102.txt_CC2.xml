The loss of imprinting of MEST has been linked to certain types of cancer by 
promoter switching. However, MEST-mediated regulation of tumorigenicity and 
metastasis are yet to be understood. Herein, we reported that MEST is a key 
regulator of IL-6/JAK/STAT3/Twist-1 signal pathway-mediated tumor metastasis. 
Enhanced MEST expression is significantly associated with pathogenesis of breast 
cancer patients. Also, MEST induces metastatic potential of breast cancer 
through induction of the EMT-TFs-mediated EMT program. Moreover, MEST leads to 
Twist-1 induction by STAT3 activation and subsequently enables the induction of 
activation of the EMT program via the induction of STAT3 nuclear translocation. 
Furthermore, the c-terminal region of MEST was essential for STAT3 activation 
via the induction of JAK2/STAT3 complex formation. Finally, MEST is required for 
metastasis in an experimental metastasis model. These observations suggest that 
MEST is a promising target for intervention to prevent tumor metastasis.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[A Network of Macrophages Supports Mitochondrial Homeostasis in the Heart.

Cardiomyocytes are subjected to the intense mechanical stress and metabolic 
demands of the beating heart. It is unclear whether these cells, which are 
long-lived and rarely renew, manage to preserve homeostasis on their own. While 
analyzing macrophages lodged within the healthy myocardium, we discovered that 
they actively took up material, including mitochondria, derived from 
cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes ejected dysfunctional mitochondria and other 
cargo in dedicated membranous particles reminiscent of neural exophers, through 
a process driven by the cardiomyocyte's autophagy machinery that was enhanced 
during cardiac stress. Depletion of cardiac macrophages or deficiency in the 
phagocytic receptor Mertk resulted in defective elimination of mitochondria from 
the myocardial tissue, activation of the inflammasome, impaired autophagy, 
accumulation of anomalous mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, metabolic alterations, 
and ventricular dysfunction. Thus, we identify an immune-parenchymal pair in the 
murine heart that enables transfer of unfit material to preserve metabolic 
stability and organ function.]]></TEXT>

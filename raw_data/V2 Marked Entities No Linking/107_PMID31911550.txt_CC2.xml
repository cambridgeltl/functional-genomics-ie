Chemoresistance in KRAS-Driven Pancreatic Cancers.

Pancreatic cancer is a disease with limited therapeutic options. Resistance to 
chemotherapies poses a significant clinical challenge for patients with 
pancreatic cancer and contributes to a high rate of recurrence. Oncogenic KRAS, 
a critical driver of pancreatic cancer, promotes metabolic reprogramming and 
upregulates NRF2, a master regulator of the antioxidant network. Here, we show 
that NRF2 contributed to chemoresistance and was associated with a poor 
prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. NRF2 activation metabolically 
rewired and elevated pathways involved in glutamine metabolism. This curbed 
chemoresistance in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancers. In addition, manipulating 
glutamine metabolism restrained the assembly of stress granules, an indicator of 
chemoresistance. Glutaminase inhibitors sensitized chemoresistant pancreatic 
cancer cells to gemcitabine, thereby improving the effectiveness of 
chemotherapy. This therapeutic approach holds promise as a novel therapy for 
patients with pancreatic cancer harboring KRAS mutation. SIGNIFICANCE: These 
findings illuminate the mechanistic features of KRAS-mediated chemoresistance 
and provide a rationale for exploiting metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic 
cancer cells to confer therapeutic opportunities that could be translated into 
clinical trials. ]]></TEXT>

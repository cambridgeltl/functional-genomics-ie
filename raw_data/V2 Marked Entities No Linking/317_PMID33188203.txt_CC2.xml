YTHDC1 mitigates ischemic stroke by promoting Akt phosphorylation through 
destabilizing PTEN mRNA.

YTH Domain Containing 1 (YTHDC1) is one of the m6A readers that is essential for 
oocyte development and tumor progression. The role of YTHDC1 in neuronal 
survival and ischemic stroke is unknown. Here, we found that YTHDC1 was 
unregulated in the early phase of ischemic stroke. Knockdown of YTHDC1 
exacerbated ischemic brain injury and overexpression of YTHDC1 protected rats 
against brain injury. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 promoted PTEN mRNA degradation to 
increase Akt phosphorylation, thus facilitating neuronal survival in particular 
after ischemia. These data identify YTHDC1 as a novel regulator of neuronal 
survival and modulating m6A reader YTHDC1 may provide a potential therapeutic 
target for ischemic stroke.]]></TEXT>

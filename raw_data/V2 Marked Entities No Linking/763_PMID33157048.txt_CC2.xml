Angiogenesis Blockade.

Integrated multi-omics evaluation of 823 tumors from advanced renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) patients identifies molecular subsets associated with 
differential clinical outcomes to angiogenesis blockade alone or with a 
checkpoint inhibitor. Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis reveals seven 
molecular subsets with distinct angiogenesis, immune, cell-cycle, metabolism, 
and stromal programs. While sunitinib and atezolizumab + bevacizumab are 
effective in subsets with high angiogenesis, atezolizumab + bevacizumab improves 
clinical benefit in tumors with high T-effector and/or cell-cycle transcription. 
Somatic mutations in PBRM1 and KDM5C associate with high angiogenesis and 
AMPK/fatty acid oxidation gene expression, while CDKN2A/B and TP53 alterations 
associate with increased cell-cycle and anabolic metabolism. Sarcomatoid tumors 
exhibit lower prevalence of PBRM1 mutations and angiogenesis markers, frequent 
CDKN2A/B alterations, and increased PD-L1 expression. These findings can be 
applied to molecularly stratify patients, explain improved outcomes of 
sarcomatoid tumors to checkpoint blockade versus antiangiogenics alone, and 
develop personalized therapies in RCC and other indications.]]></TEXT>

autophagy.

Dysregulation of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death is a 
central feature of malignances. Death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) 
regulates programmed cell death including apoptosis and autophagy. Our previous 
study showed that DAPK3 downregulation was detected in more than half of gastric 
cancers (GCs), which was related to tumor invasion, metastasis, and poor 
prognosis. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying DAPK3-mediated 
tumor suppression remains unclear. Here, we showed that the tumor suppressive 
function of DAPK3 was dependent on autophagy process. Mass spectrometry, in 
vitro kinase assay, and immunoprecipitation revealed that DAPK3 increased ULK1 
activity by direct ULK1 phosphorylation at Ser556. ULK1 phosphorylation by DAPK3 
facilitates the ULK1 complex formation, the VPS34 complex activation, and 
autophagy induction upon starvation. The kinase activity of DAPK3 and ULK1 
Ser556 phosphorylation were required for DAPK3-modulated tumor suppression. The 
coordinate expression of DAPK3 with ULK1 Ser556 phosphorylation was confirmed in 
clinical GC samples, and this co-expression was correlated with favorable 
survival outcomes in patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that the 
tumor-suppressor roles of DAPK3 in GC are associated with autophagy and that 
DAPK3 is a novel autophagy regulator, which can directly phosphorylate ULK1 and 
activate ULK1. Thus, DAPK3 might be a promising prognostic autophagy-associated 
marker.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Therapeutic Targeting of RNA Splicing Catalysis through Inhibition of Protein 
Arginine Methylation.

Cancer-associated mutations in genes encoding RNA splicing factors (SFs) 
commonly occur in leukemias, as well as in a variety of solid tumors, and confer 
dependence on wild-type splicing. These observations have led to clinical 
efforts to directly inhibit the spliceosome in patients with refractory 
leukemias. Here, we identify that inhibiting symmetric or asymmetric 
dimethylation of arginine, mediated by PRMT5 and type I protein arginine 
methyltransferases (PRMTs), respectively, reduces splicing fidelity and results 
in preferential killing of SF-mutant leukemias over wild-type counterparts. 
These data identify genetic subsets of cancer most likely to respond to PRMT 
inhibition, synergistic effects of combined PRMT5 and type I PRMT inhibition, 
and a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic efficacy of PRMT inhibition in 
cancer.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Structural and Functional Analysis of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein 
Variant.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus 
worldwide, reaching near fixation in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G 
was more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, 
and on cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 or of ACE2 
orthologs from various mammals, including Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and 
Malayan pangolin. D614G did not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or 
incorporation into SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced 
due to a faster dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by 
cryo-electron microscopy showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact and 
that the conformation is shifted toward an ACE2 binding-competent state, which 
is modeled to be on pathway for virion membrane fusion with target cells. 
Consistent with this more open conformation, neutralization potency of 
antibodies targeting the S protein receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.]]></TEXT>

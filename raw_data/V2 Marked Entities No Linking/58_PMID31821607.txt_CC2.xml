activation.

Several studies have shown that dysfunction of macroautophagy/autophagy is 
associated with many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and 
cancer. To explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a 
cell-based functional screening with SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, 
using an siRNA library and identified TMED10 (transmembrane p24 trafficking 
protein 10), previously known as the γ-secretase-modulating protein, as a novel 
regulator of autophagy. Further investigations revealed that depletion of TMED10 
induced the activation of autophagy. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction 
assays showed that TMED10 directly binds to ATG4B (autophagy related gene 4B 
cysteine peptidase), and the interaction is diminished under autophagy 
activation conditions such as rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation. In 
addition, inhibition of TMED10 significantly enhanced the proteolytic activity 
of ATG4B for LC3 cleavage. Importantly, the expression of TMED10 in AD 
(Alzheimer disease) patients was considerably decreased, and downregulation of 
TMED10 increased amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Treatment with Aβ increased ATG4B 
proteolytic activity as well as dissociation of TMED10 and ATG4B. Taken 
together, our results suggest that the AD-associated protein TMED10 negatively 
regulates autophagy by inhibiting ATG4B activity.]]></TEXT>

with Ipilimumab in Small-Cell Lung Cancer.

Durable responses and encouraging survival have been demonstrated with immune 
checkpoint inhibitors in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), but predictive markers 
are unknown. We used whole exome sequencing to evaluate the impact of tumor 
mutational burden on efficacy of nivolumab monotherapy or combined with 
ipilimumab in patients with SCLC from the nonrandomized or randomized cohorts of 
CheckMate 032. Patients received nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg plus 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks). Efficacy of nivolumab ± ipilimumab was 
enhanced in patients with high tumor mutational burden. Nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab appeared to provide a greater clinical benefit than nivolumab 
monotherapy in the high tumor mutational burden tertile.]]></TEXT>

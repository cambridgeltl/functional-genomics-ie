Progenitors and Oncogenic Cascades during Tumorigenesis and Relapse.

Progenitor heterogeneity and identities underlying tumor initiation and relapse 
in medulloblastomas remain elusive. Utilizing single-cell transcriptomic 
analysis, we demonstrated a developmental hierarchy of progenitor pools in Sonic 
Hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastomas, and identified OLIG2-expressing glial 
progenitors as transit-amplifying cells at the tumorigenic onset. Although 
OLIG2+ progenitors become quiescent stem-like cells in full-blown tumors, they 
are highly enriched in therapy-resistant and recurrent medulloblastomas. 
Depletion of mitotic Olig2+ progenitors or Olig2 ablation impeded tumor 
initiation. Genomic profiling revealed that OLIG2 modulates chromatin landscapes 
and activates oncogenic networks including HIPPO-YAP/TAZ and AURORA-A/MYCN 
pathways. Co-targeting these oncogenic pathways induced tumor growth arrest. 
Together, our results indicate that glial lineage-associated OLIG2+ progenitors 
are tumor-initiating cells during medulloblastoma tumorigenesis and relapse, 
suggesting OLIG2-driven oncogenic networks as potential therapeutic targets.]]></TEXT>

stem cells.

Mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) cultures contain a rare cell population of 
"2C-like" cells resembling two-cell embryos, the key stage of zygotic genome 
activation (ZGA). Little is known about positive regulators of the 2C-like state 
and two-cell stage embryos. Here we show that GADD45 (growth arrest and DNA 
damage 45) proteins, regulators of TET (TET methylcytosine dioxygenase)-mediated 
DNA demethylation, promote both states. Methylome analysis of Gadd45a,b,g 
triple-knockout (TKO) ESCs reveal locus-specific DNA hypermethylation of âˆ¼7000 
sites, which are enriched for enhancers and loci undergoing TET-TDG (thymine DNA 
glycosylase)-mediated demethylation. Gene expression is misregulated in TKOs, 
notably upon differentiation, and displays signatures of DNMT (DNA 
methyltransferase) and TET targets. TKOs manifest impaired transition into the 
2C-like state and exhibit DNA hypermethylation and down-regulation of 2C-like 
state-specific genes. Gadd45a,b double-mutant mouse embryos display embryonic 
sublethality, deregulated ZGA gene expression, and developmental arrest. Our 
study reveals an unexpected role of GADD45 proteins in embryonic two-cell stage 
regulation.]]></TEXT>

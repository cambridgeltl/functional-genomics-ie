<TEXT><![CDATA[Liver Immune Profiling Reveals Pathogenesis and Therapeutics for Biliary 
Atresia.

Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe cholangiopathy that leads to liver failure in 
infants, but its pathogenesis remains to be fully characterized. By single-cell 
RNA profiling, we observed macrophage hypo-inflammation, Kupffer cell scavenger 
function defects, cytotoxic T cell expansion, and deficiency of CX3CR1+effector 
T and natural killer (NK) cells in infants with BA. More importantly, we 
discovered that hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis did not cease after birth and that 
tolerance defects contributed to immunoglobulin G (IgG)-autoantibody 
accumulation in BA. In a rhesus-rotavirus induced BA model, depleting B cells or 
blocking antigen presentation ameliorated liver damage. In a pilot clinical 
study, we demonstrated that rituximab was effective in depleting hepatic B cells 
and restoring the functions of macrophages, Kupffer cells, and T cells to levels 
comparable to those of control subjects. In summary, our comprehensive immune 
profiling in infants with BA had educed that B-cell-modifying therapies may 
alleviate liver pathology.]]></TEXT>

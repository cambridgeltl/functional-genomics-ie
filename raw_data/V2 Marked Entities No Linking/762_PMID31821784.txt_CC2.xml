<TEXT><![CDATA[A Menin-MLL Inhibitor Induces Specific Chromatin Changes and Eradicates Disease 
in Models of MLL-Rearranged Leukemia.

Inhibition of the Menin (MEN1) and MLL (MLL1, KMT2A) interaction is a potential 
therapeutic strategy for MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia. Structure-based design 
yielded the potent, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule 
inhibitor VTP50469. Cell lines carrying MLL rearrangements were selectively 
responsive to VTP50469. VTP50469 displaced Menin from protein complexes and 
inhibited chromatin occupancy of MLL at select genes. Loss of MLL binding led to 
changes in gene expression, differentiation, and apoptosis. Patient-derived 
xenograft (PDX) models derived from patients with either MLL-r acute myeloid 
leukemia or MLL-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) showed dramatic reductions 
of leukemia burden when treated with VTP50469. Multiple mice engrafted with 
MLL-r ALL remained disease free for more than 1 year after treatment. These data 
support rapid translation of this approach to clinical trials.]]></TEXT>

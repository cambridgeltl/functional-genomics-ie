To better understand host-virus genetic dependencies and find potential 
therapeutic targets for COVID-19, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR 
loss-of-function screen to identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 viral 
infection of human alveolar epithelial cells. Top-ranked genes cluster into 
distinct pathways, including the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, Retromer, and 
Commander complexes. We validate these gene targets using several orthogonal 
methods such as CRISPR knockout, RNA interference knockdown, and small-molecule 
inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify shared transcriptional 
changes in cholesterol biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes. In addition, 
given the key role of the ACE2 receptor in the early stages of viral entry, we 
show that loss of RAB7A reduces viral entry by sequestering the ACE2 receptor 
inside cells. Overall, this work provides a genome-scale, quantitative resource 
of the impact of the loss of each host gene on fitness/response to viral 
infection.

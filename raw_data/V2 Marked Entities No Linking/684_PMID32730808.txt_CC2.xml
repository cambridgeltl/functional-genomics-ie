<TEXT><![CDATA[Multiple Signaling Roles of CD3ε and Its Application in CAR-T Cell Therapy.

A T cell receptor (TCR) mediates antigen-induced signaling through its 
associated CD3ε, δ, γ, and ζ, but the contributions of different CD3 chains 
remain elusive. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we simultaneously 
quantitated the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation 
motif (ITAM) of all CD3 chains upon TCR stimulation. A subpopulation of CD3ε 
ITAMs was mono-phosphorylated, owing to Lck kinase selectivity, and specifically 
recruited the inhibitory Csk kinase to attenuate TCR signaling, suggesting that 
TCR is a self-restrained signaling machinery containing both activating and 
inhibitory motifs. Moreover, we found that incorporation of the CD3ε cytoplasmic 
domain into a second-generation chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) improved 
antitumor activity of CAR-T cells. Mechanistically, the Csk-recruiting ITAM of 
CD3ε reduced CAR-T cytokine production whereas the basic residue rich sequence 
(BRS) of CD3ε promoted CAR-T persistence via p85 recruitment. Collectively, CD3ε 
is a built-in multifunctional signal tuner, and increasing CD3 diversity 
represents a strategy to design next-generation CAR.]]></TEXT>

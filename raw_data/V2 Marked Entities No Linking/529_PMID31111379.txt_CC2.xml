synoviocytes and regulates Th17/Treg imbalance in rheumatoid arthritis.

In our previous study, we explored the therapeutic effect of berberine (BBR) 
against IL-21/IL-21R mediated inflammatory proliferation of adjuvant-induced 
arthritic fibroblast-like synoviocytes (AA-FLS) through the PI3K/Akt pathway. 
The current study was designed to explore the therapeutic potential of BBR 
(15-45 µM) against IL-21/IL-21R mediated autophagy in AA-FLS mediated through 
PI3K/Akt signaling and Th17/Treg imbalance. Upon IL-21 stimulation, AA-FLS 
expressed elevated levels of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5), Beclin-1 and 
LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate 3-II (LC3-II) through the utilization of 
p62 and inhibition of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). BBR (15-45 µM) inhibited 
autophagy in AA-FLS cells mediated through PI3K/Akt signaling via suppressing 
autophagic elements, p62 sequestration and induction of CHOP in a dose-dependent 
manner. Moreover, IL-21 promoted the uncontrolled proliferation of AA-FLS 
through induction of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and diminished expression of 
Bcl-2 associated X protein (BAX) via PI3K/Akt signaling. BBR inhibited the 
proliferation of AA-FLS via promoting apoptosis through increased expression of 
BAX and diminished Bcl-2 transcription factor levels. Furthermore, T cells 
stimulated with IL-21 induced CD4+ CD196+ Th17 cells proliferation through RORγt 
activation mediated in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner. BBR inhibited the 
proliferation of Th17 cells through downregulation of RORγt in a 
concentration-dependent manner. BBR also promoted the differentiation of CD4+ 
CD25+ Treg cells through induction of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) activation via 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and upregulation of cytochrome P450 family 1, 
subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1). Collectively, we conclude that BBR might 
attenuate AA-FLS proliferation through inhibition of IL-21/IL-21R dependent 
autophagy and regulates the Th17/Treg imbalance in RA.]]></TEXT>

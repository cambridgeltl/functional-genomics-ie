ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a common pathology when the blood supply to an 
organ was disrupted and then restored. During the reperfusion process, 
inflammation and tissue injury were triggered, which were mediated by 
immunocytes and cytokines. However, the mechanisms initiating I/R-induced 
inflammation and driving immunocytes activation remained largely unknown. In 
this study, we identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-H19 as the key onset of 
I/R-induced inflammation. We found that I/R increased lncRNA-H19 expression to 
significantly promote NLRP3/6 inflammasome imbalance and resulted in microglial 
pyroptosis, cytokines overproduction, and neuronal death. These damages were 
effectively inhibited by lncRNA-H19 knockout. Specifically, lncRNA-H19 
functioned via sponging miR-21 to facilitate PDCD4 expression and formed a 
competing endogenous RNA network (ceRNET) in ischemic cascade. LncRNA 
H19/miR-21/PDCD4 ceRNET can directly regulate I/R-induced sterile inflammation 
and neuronal lesion in vivo. We thus propose that lncRNA-H19 is a previously 
unknown danger signals in the molecular and immunological pathways of I/R 
injury, and pharmacological approaches to inhibit H19 seem likely to become 
treatment modalities for patients in the near future based on these mechanistic 
findings.]]></TEXT>

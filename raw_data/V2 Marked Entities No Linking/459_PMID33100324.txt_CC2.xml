translation.

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal 
biogenesis. The post-translational phosphorylation modulations of TFEB by mTOR 
and ERK signaling can determine its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and activity in 
response to nutrient availability. However, regulations of TFEB at translational 
level are rarely known. Here, we found that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a 
tumor suppressor, decreased levels of nuclear TFEB to inhibit lysosome 
biogenesis and function. Mechanistically, PDCD4 reduces global pool of TFEB by 
suppressing TFEB translation in an eIF4A-dependent manner, rather than 
influencing mTOR- and ERK2-dependnet TFEB nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Both of 
MA3 domains within PDCD4 are required for TFEB translation inhibition. 
Furthermore, TFEB is required for PDCD4-mediated lysosomal function suppression. 
In the tumor microenvironment, PDCD4 deficiency promotes the anti-tumor effect 
of macrophage via enhancing TFEB expression. Our research reveals a novel 
PDCD4-dependent TFEB translational regulation and supports PDCD4 as a potential 
therapeutic target for lysosome dysfunction related diseases.]]></TEXT>

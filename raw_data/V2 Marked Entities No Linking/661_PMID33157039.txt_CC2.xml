<TEXT><![CDATA[Bacterial Retrons Function In Anti-Phage Defense.

Retrons are bacterial genetic elements comprised of a reverse transcriptase (RT) 
and a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). The RT uses the ncRNA as template, generating a 
chimeric RNA/DNA molecule in which the RNA and DNA components are covalently 
linked. Although retrons were discovered three decades ago, their function 
remained unknown. We report that retrons function as anti-phage defense systems. 
The defensive unit is composed of three components: the RT, the ncRNA, and an 
effector protein. We examined multiple retron systems and show that they confer 
defense against a broad range of phages via abortive infection. Focusing on 
retron Ec48, we show evidence that it "guards" RecBCD, a complex with central 
anti-phage functions in bacteria. Inhibition of RecBCD by phage proteins 
activates the retron, leading to abortive infection and cell death. Thus, the 
Ec48 retron forms a second line of defense that is triggered if the first lines 
of defense have collapsed.]]></TEXT>

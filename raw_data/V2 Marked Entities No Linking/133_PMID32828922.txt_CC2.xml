Adenosquamous Carcinoma of the Pancreas.

Adenosquamous cancer of the pancreas (ASCP) is a subtype of pancreatic cancer 
that has a worse prognosis and greater metastatic potential than the more common 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) subtype. To distinguish the genomic 
landscape of ASCP and identify actionable targets for this lethal cancer, we 
applied DNA content flow cytometry to a series of 15 tumor samples including 
five patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We interrogated purified sorted tumor 
fractions from these samples with whole-genome copy-number variant (CNV), 
whole-exome sequencing, and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using 
sequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses. These identified a variety of somatic genomic 
lesions targeting chromatin regulators in ASCP genomes that were superimposed on 
well-characterized genomic lesions including mutations in TP53 (87%) and KRAS 
(73%), amplification of MYC (47%), and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (40%) that 
are common in PDACs. Furthermore, a comparison of ATAC-seq profiles of three 
ASCP and three PDAC genomes using flow-sorted PDX models identified genes with 
accessible chromatin unique to the ASCP genomes, including the lysine 
methyltransferase SMYD2 and the pancreatic cancer stem cell regulator RORC in 
all three ASCPs, and a FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion associated with focal CNVs in both 
genes in a single ASCP. Finally, we demonstrate significant activity of a pan 
FGFR inhibitor against organoids derived from the FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion-positive 
ASCP PDX model. Our results suggest that the genomic and epigenomic landscape of 
ASCP provide new strategies for targeting this aggressive subtype of pancreatic 
cancer. ]]></TEXT>

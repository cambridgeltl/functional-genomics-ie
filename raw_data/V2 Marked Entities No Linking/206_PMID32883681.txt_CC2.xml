<TEXT><![CDATA[Break-induced replication promotes fragile telomere formation.

TRF1 facilitates the replication of telomeric DNA in part by recruiting the BLM 
helicase, which can resolve G-quadruplexes on the lagging-strand template. 
Lagging-strand telomeres lacking TRF1 or BLM form fragile telomeres-structures 
that resemble common fragile sites (CFSs)-but how they are formed is not known. 
We report that analogous to CFSs, fragile telomeres in BLM-deficient cells 
involved double-strand break (DSB) formation, in this case by the SLX4/SLX1 
nuclease. The DSBs were repaired by POLD3/POLD4-dependent break-induced 
replication (BIR), resulting in fragile telomeres containing conservatively 
replicated DNA. BIR also promoted fragile telomere formation in cells with 
FokI-induced telomeric DSBs and in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) 
cells, which have spontaneous telomeric damage. BIR of telomeric DSBs competed 
with PARP1-, LIG3-, and XPF-dependent alternative nonhomologous end joining 
(alt-NHEJ), which did not generate fragile telomeres. Collectively, these 
findings indicate that fragile telomeres can arise from BIR-mediated repair of 
telomeric DSBs.]]></TEXT>

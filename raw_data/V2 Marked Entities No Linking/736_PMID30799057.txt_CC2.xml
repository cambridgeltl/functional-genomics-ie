<TEXT><![CDATA[Targeting an RNA-Binding Protein Network in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential modulators of transcription and 
translation frequently dysregulated in cancer. We systematically interrogated 
RBP dependencies in human cancers using a comprehensive CRISPR/Cas9 
domain-focused screen targeting RNA-binding domains of 490 classical RBPs. This 
uncovered a network of physically interacting RBPs upregulated in acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and crucial for maintaining RNA splicing and AML survival. 
Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of one key member of this network, RBM39, 
repressed cassette exon inclusion and promoted intron retention within mRNAs 
encoding HOXA9 targets as well as in other RBPs preferentially required in AML. 
The effects of RBM39 loss on splicing further resulted in preferential lethality 
of spliceosomal mutant AML, providing a strategy for treatment of AML bearing 
RBP splicing mutations.]]></TEXT>

motoneuron degeneration.

Macroautophagy/autophagy, a defense mechanism against aberrant stresses, in 
neurons counteracts aggregate-prone misfolded protein toxicity. Autophagy 
induction might be beneficial in neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). The natural 
compound trehalose promotes autophagy via TFEB (transcription factor EB), 
ameliorating disease phenotype in multiple ND models, but its mechanism is still 
obscure. We demonstrated that trehalose regulates autophagy by inducing rapid 
and transient lysosomal enlargement and membrane permeabilization (LMP). This 
effect correlated with the calcium-dependent phosphatase PPP3/calcineurin 
activation, TFEB dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Trehalose 
upregulated genes for the TFEB target and regulator Ppargc1a, lysosomal 
hydrolases and membrane proteins (Ctsb, Gla, Lamp2a, Mcoln1, Tpp1) and several 
autophagy-related components (Becn1, Atg10, Atg12, Sqstm1/p62, Map1lc3b, Hspb8 
and Bag3) mostly in a PPP3- and TFEB-dependent manner. TFEB silencing 
counteracted the trehalose pro-degradative activity on misfolded protein 
causative of motoneuron diseases. Similar effects were exerted by 
trehalase-resistant trehalose analogs, melibiose and lactulose. Thus, limited 
lysosomal damage might induce autophagy, perhaps as a compensatory mechanism, a 
process that is beneficial to counteract neurodegeneration.

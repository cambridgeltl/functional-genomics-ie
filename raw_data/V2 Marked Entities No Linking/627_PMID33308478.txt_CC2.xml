<TEXT><![CDATA[A Molecular Calcium Integrator Reveals a Striatal Cell Type Driving Aversion.

The ability to record transient cellular events in the DNA or RNA of cells would 
enable precise, large-scale analysis, selection, and reprogramming of 
heterogeneous cell populations. Here, we report a molecular technology for 
stable genetic tagging of cells that exhibit activity-related increases in 
intracellular calcium concentration (FLiCRE). We used FLiCRE to 
transcriptionally label activated neural ensembles in the nucleus accumbens of 
the mouse brain during brief stimulation of aversive inputs. Using single-cell 
RNA sequencing, we detected FLiCRE transcripts among the endogenous 
transcriptome, providing simultaneous readout of both cell-type and calcium 
activation history. We identified a cell type in the nucleus accumbens activated 
downstream of long-range excitatory projections. Taking advantage of FLiCRE's 
modular design, we expressed an optogenetic channel selectively in this cell 
type and showed that direct recruitment of this otherwise genetically 
inaccessible population elicits behavioral aversion. The specificity and minute 
resolution of FLiCRE enables molecularly informed characterization, 
manipulation, and reprogramming of activated cellular ensembles.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[STING directly activates autophagy to tune the innate immune response.

STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a central molecule that binds to 
cyclic dinucleotides produced by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) to activate 
innate immunity against microbial infection. Here we report that STING harbors 
classic LC-3 interacting regions (LIRs) and mediates autophagy through its 
direct interaction with LC3. We observed that poly(dA:dT), cGAMP, and HSV-1 
induced STING-dependent autophagy and degradation of STING immediately after 
TBK1 activation. STING induces non-canonical autophagy that is dependent on 
ATG5, whereas other autophagy regulators such as Beclin1, Atg9a, ULK1, and p62 
are dispensable. LIR mutants of STING abolished its interaction with LC3 and its 
activation of autophagy. Also, mutants that abolish STING dimerization and 
cGAMP-binding diminished the STING-LC3 interaction and subsequent autophagy, 
suggesting that STING activation is indispensable for autophagy induction. Our 
results thus uncover dual functions of STING in activating the immune response 
and autophagy, and suggest that STING is involved in ensuring a measured innate 
immune response.]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[Antibody Affinity Shapes the Choice between Memory and Germinal Center B Cell 
Fates.

Immunological memory is required for protection against repeated infections and 
is the basis of all effective vaccines. Antibodies produced by memory B cells 
play an essential role in many of these responses. We have combined lineage 
tracing with antibody cloning from single B cells to examine the role of 
affinity in B cell selection into germinal centers (GCs) and the memory B cell 
compartment in mice immunized with an HIV-1 antigen. We find that 
contemporaneously developing memory and GC B cells differ in their affinity for 
antigen throughout the immune response. Whereas GC cells and their precursors 
are enriched in antigen binding, memory B cells are not. Thus, the polyclonal 
memory B cell compartment is composed of B cells that were activated during the 
immune response but whose antigen binding affinity failed to support further 
clonal expansion in the GC.]]></TEXT>

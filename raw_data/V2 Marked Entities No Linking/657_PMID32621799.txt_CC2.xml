Scar tissue size following myocardial infarction is an independent predictor of 
cardiovascular outcomes, yet little is known about factors regulating scar size. 
We demonstrate that collagen V, a minor constituent of heart scars, regulates 
the size of heart scars after ischemic injury. Depletion of collagen V led to a 
paradoxical increase in post-infarction scar size with worsening of heart 
function. A systems genetics approach across 100 in-bred strains of mice 
demonstrated that collagen V is a critical driver of postinjury heart function. 
We show that collagen V deficiency alters the mechanical properties of scar 
tissue, and altered reciprocal feedback between matrix and cells induces 
expression of mechanosensitive integrins that drive fibroblast activation and 
increase scar size. Cilengitide, an inhibitor of specific integrins, rescues the 
phenotype of increased post-injury scarring in collagen-V-deficient mice. These 
observations demonstrate that collagen V regulates scar size in an 
integrin-dependent manner.]]></TEXT>

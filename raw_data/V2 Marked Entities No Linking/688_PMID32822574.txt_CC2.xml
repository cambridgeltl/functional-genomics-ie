Trophoblasts.

Maternal decidual NK (dNK) cells promote placentation, but how they protect 
against placental infection while maintaining fetal tolerance is unclear. Here 
we show that human dNK cells highly express the antimicrobial peptide granulysin 
(GNLY) and selectively transfer it via nanotubes to extravillous trophoblasts to 
kill intracellular Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) without killing the trophoblast. 
Transfer of GNLY, but not other cell death-inducing cytotoxic granule proteins, 
strongly inhibits Lm in human placental cultures and in mouse and human 
trophoblast cell lines. Placental and fetal Lm loads are lower and pregnancy 
success is greatly improved in pregnant Lm-infected GNLY-transgenic mice than in 
wild-type mice that lack GNLY. This immune defense is not restricted to 
pregnancy; peripheral NK (pNK) cells also transfer GNLY to kill bacteria in 
macrophages and dendritic cells without killing the host cell. Nanotube transfer 
of GNLY allows dNK to protect against infection while leaving the maternal-fetal 
barrier intact.]]></TEXT>

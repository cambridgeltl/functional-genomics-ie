Cancer.

Cancer immunotherapy shows limited efficacy against many solid tumors that 
originate from epithelial tissues, including triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC). We identify the SOX4 transcription factor as an important resistance 
mechanism to T cell-mediated cytotoxicity for TNBC cells. Mechanistic studies 
demonstrate that inactivation of SOX4 in tumor cells increases the expression of 
genes in a number of innate and adaptive immune pathways important for 
protective tumor immunity. Expression of SOX4 is regulated by the integrin αvβ6 
receptor on the surface of tumor cells, which activates TGFβ from a latent 
precursor. An integrin αvβ6/8-blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibits SOX4 
expression and sensitizes TNBC cells to cytotoxic T cells. This integrin mAb 
induces a substantial survival benefit in highly metastatic murine TNBC models 
poorly responsive to PD-1 blockade. Targeting of the integrin αvβ6-TGFβ-SOX4 
pathway therefore provides therapeutic opportunities for TNBC and other highly 
aggressive human cancers of epithelial origin.]]></TEXT>

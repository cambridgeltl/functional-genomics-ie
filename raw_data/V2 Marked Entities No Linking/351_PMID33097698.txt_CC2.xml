<TEXT><![CDATA[HCF-1 promotes cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of CDC42.

The eukaryotic cell cycle involves a highly orchestrated series of events in 
which the cellular genome is replicated during a synthesis (S) phase and each of 
the two resulting copies are segregated properly during mitosis (M). Host cell 
factor-1 (HCF-1) is a transcriptional co-regulator that is essential for and has 
been implicated in basic cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation 
and cell cycle progression. Although a series of HCF-1 transcriptional targets 
have been identified, few functional clues have been provided, especially for 
chromosome segregation. Our results showed that HCF-1 activated CDC42 expression 
by binding to the -881 to -575 region upstream of the CDC42 transcription start 
site, and the regulation of CDC42 expression by HCF-1 was correlated with cell 
cycle progression. The overexpression of a spontaneously cycling and 
constitutively active CDC42 mutant (CDC42F28L) rescued G1 phase delay and 
multinucleate defects in mitosis upon the loss of HCF-1. Therefore, these 
results establish that HCF-1 ensures proper cell cycle progression by regulating 
the expression of CDC42, which indicates a possible mechanism of cell cycle 
coordination and the regulation mode of typical Rho GTPases.]]></TEXT>

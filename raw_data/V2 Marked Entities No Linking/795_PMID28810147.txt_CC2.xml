<TEXT><![CDATA[Macrophage Polarization Contributes to Glioblastoma Eradication by Combination 
Immunovirotherapy and Immune Checkpoint Blockade.

Glioblastoma is an immunosuppressive, fatal brain cancer that contains 
glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs). Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) 
selectively replicates in cancer cells while inducing anti-tumor immunity. oHSV 
G47Δ expressing murine IL-12 (G47Δ-mIL12), antibodies to immune checkpoints 
(CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1), or dual combinations modestly extended survival of a 
mouse glioma model. However, the triple combination of anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, 
and G47Δ-mIL12 cured most mice in two glioma models. This treatment was 
associated with macrophage influx and M1-like polarization, along with increased 
T effector to T regulatory cell ratios. Immune cell depletion studies 
demonstrated that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as macrophages are required for 
synergistic curative activity. This combination should be translatable to the 
clinic and other immunosuppressive cancers.]]></TEXT>

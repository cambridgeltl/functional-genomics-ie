<TEXT><![CDATA[Genomic and Functional Approaches to Understanding Cancer Aneuploidy.

Aneuploidy, whole chromosome or chromosome arm imbalance, is a near-universal 
characteristic of human cancers. In 10,522 cancer genomes from The Cancer Genome 
Atlas, aneuploidy was correlated with TP53 mutation, somatic mutation rate, and 
expression of proliferation genes. Aneuploidy was anti-correlated with 
expression of immune signaling genes, due to decreased leukocyte infiltrates in 
high-aneuploidy samples. Chromosome arm-level alterations show cancer-specific 
patterns, including loss of chromosome arm 3p in squamous cancers. We applied 
genome engineering to delete 3p in lung cells, causing decreased proliferation 
rescued in part by chromosome 3 duplication. This study defines genomic and 
phenotypic correlates of cancer aneuploidy and provides an experimental approach 
to study chromosome arm aneuploidy.]]></TEXT>

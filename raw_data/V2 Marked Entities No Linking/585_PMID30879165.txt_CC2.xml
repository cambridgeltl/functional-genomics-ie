<TEXT><![CDATA[Improved in vivo targeting of BCL-2 phenotypic conversion through hollow gold 
nanoshell delivery.

Although new cancer therapeutics are discovered at a rapid pace, lack of 
effective means of delivery and cancer chemoresistance thwart many of the 
promising therapeutics. We demonstrate a method that confronts both of these 
issues with the light-activated delivery of a Bcl-2 functional converting 
peptide, NuBCP-9, using hollow gold nanoshells. This approach has shown not only 
to increase the efficacy of the peptide 30-fold in vitro but also has shown to 
reduce paclitaxel resistant H460 lung xenograft tumor growth by 56.4%.]]></TEXT>

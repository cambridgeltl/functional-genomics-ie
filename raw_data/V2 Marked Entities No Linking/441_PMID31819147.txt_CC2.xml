<TEXT><![CDATA[Protein phosphatase 6 is a key factor regulating spermatogenesis.

Protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) is a member of the PP2A-like subfamily, which plays 
a critical role in many fundamental cellular processes. We recently reported 
that PP6 is essential for female fertility. Here, we report that PP6 is involved 
in meiotic recombination and that germ cell-specific deletion of PP6 by 
Stra8-Cre causes defective spermatogenesis. The PP6-deficient spermatocytes were 
arrested at the pachytene stage and defects in DSB repair and crossover 
formation were observed, indicating that PP6 facilitated meiotic double-stranded 
breaks (DSB) repair. Further investigations revealed that depletion of PP6 in 
the germ cells affected chromatin relaxation, which was dependent on MAPK 
pathway activity, consequently preventing programmed DSB repair factors from 
being recruited to proper positions on the chromatin. Taken together, our 
results demonstrate that PP6 has an important role in meiotic recombination and 
male fertility.

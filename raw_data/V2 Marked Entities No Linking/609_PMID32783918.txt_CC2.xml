<TEXT><![CDATA[TREM2 Modulation Remodels the Tumor Myeloid Landscape Enhancing Anti-PD-1 
Immunotherapy.

Checkpoint immunotherapy unleashes T cell control of tumors, but is undermined 
by immunosuppressive myeloid cells. TREM2 is a myeloid receptor that transmits 
intracellular signals that sustain microglial responses during Alzheimer's 
disease. TREM2 is also expressed by tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Here, we 
found that Trem2-/- mice are more resistant to growth of various cancers than 
wild-type mice and are more responsive to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Furthermore, 
treatment with anti-TREM2 mAb curbed tumor growth and fostered regression when 
combined with anti-PD-1. scRNA-seq revealed that both TREM2 deletion and 
anti-TREM2 are associated with scant MRC1+ and CX3CR1+ macrophages in the tumor 
infiltrate, paralleled by expansion of myeloid subsets expressing 
immunostimulatory molecules that promote improved T cell responses. TREM2 was 
expressed in tumor macrophages in over 200 human cancer cases and inversely 
correlated with prolonged survival for two types of cancer. Thus, TREM2 might be 
targeted to modify tumor myeloid infiltrates and augment checkpoint 
immunotherapy.

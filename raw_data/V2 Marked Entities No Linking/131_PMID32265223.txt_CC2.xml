Monocytic MDSCs.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) include immature monocytic (M-MDSC) and 
granulocytic (PMN-MDSC) cells that share the ability to suppress adaptive 
immunity and to hinder the effectiveness of anticancer treatments. Of note, in 
response to IFNγ, M-MDSCs release the tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive 
molecule nitric oxide (NO), whereas macrophages largely express antitumor 
properties. Investigating these opposing activities, we found that tumor-derived 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces nuclear accumulation of p50 NF-κB in M-MDSCs, 
diverting their response to IFNγ toward NO-mediated immunosuppression and 
reducing TNFα expression. At the genome level, p50 NF-κB promoted binding of 
STAT1 to regulatory regions of selected IFNγ-dependent genes, including 
inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2). In agreement, ablation of p50 as well as 
pharmacologic inhibition of either the PGE2 receptor EP2 or NO production 
reprogrammed M-MDSCs toward a NOS2low/TNFαhigh phenotype, restoring the in vivo 
antitumor activity of IFNγ. Our results indicate that inhibition of the 
PGE2/p50/NO axis prevents MDSC-suppressive functions and restores the efficacy 
of anticancer immunotherapy.]]></TEXT>

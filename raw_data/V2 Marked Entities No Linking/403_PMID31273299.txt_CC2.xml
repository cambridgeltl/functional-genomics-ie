The amino acid antiporter system Xc- is important for the synthesis of 
glutathione (GSH) that functions to prevent lipid peroxidation and protect cells 
from nonapoptotic, iron-dependent death (i.e., ferroptosis). While the activity 
of system Xc- often positively correlates with the expression level of its light 
chain encoded by SLC7A11, inhibition of system Xc- activity by small molecules 
(e.g., erastin) causes a decrease in the intracellular GSH level, leading to 
ferroptotic cell death. How system Xc- is regulated during ferroptosis remains 
largely unknown. Here we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a 
common stress sensor, can promote ferroptosis induced by erastin. ATF3 
suppressed system Xc-, depleted intracellular GSH, and thereby promoted lipid 
peroxidation induced by erastin. ATF3 achieved this activity through binding to 
the SLC7A11 promoter and repressing SLC7A11 expression in a p53-independent 
manner. These findings thus add ATF3 to a short list of proteins that can 
regulate system Xc- and promote ferroptosis repressed by this antiporter.]]></TEXT>

Most luminal breast carcinomas (BrCas) bearing PIK3CA mutations initially 
respond to phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-α inhibitors, but many eventually 
become resistant. The underlying mechanisms of this resistance remain obscure. 
In this work, we showed that a CD44high state due to aberrant isoform splicing 
was acquired from adaptive resistance to a PI3Kα inhibitor (BLY719) in luminal 
BrCas. Notably, the expression of CD44 was positively correlated with estrogen 
receptor (ER) activity in PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers, and ER-dependent 
transcription upon PI3Kα pathway inhibition was in turn mediated by CD44. 
Furthermore, the interaction of CD44 with the ligand hyaluronan (HA) initiated 
the Src-ERK signaling cascade, which subsequently maintained AKT and mTOR 
activity in the presence of a PI3Kα inhibitor. Activation of this pathway was 
prevented by disruption of the CD44/HA interaction, which in turn restored 
sensitivity to BLY719. Our results revealed that an ER-CD44-HA signaling circuit 
that mediates robust compensatory activation of the Src-ERK signaling cascade 
may contribute to the development of acquired resistance to PI3Kα inhibitors. 
This study provides new insight into the mechanism of adaptive resistance to 
PI3Kα inhibition therapy.]]></TEXT>

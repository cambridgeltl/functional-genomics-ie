Membrane integrity is essential for cellular survival and function. The spectrum 
of mechanisms protecting cellular and intracellular membranes is not fully 
known. Our recent work has uncovered a cellular system termed MERIT for 
lysosomal membrane repair, removal and replacement. Specifically, lysosomal 
membrane damage induces, in succession, ESCRT-dependent membrane repair, 
macroautophagy/autophagy-dominant removal of damaged lysosomes, and initiation 
of lysosomal biogenesis via transcriptional programs. The MERIT system is 
governed by galectins, a family of cytosolically synthesized lectins recognizing 
Î²-galactoside glycans. We found in this study that LGALS3 (galectin 3) detects 
membrane damage by detecting exposed lumenal glycosyl groups, recruits and 
organizes ESCRT components PDCD6IP/ALIX, CHMP4A, and CHMPB at damaged sites on 
the lysosomes, and facilitates ESCRT-driven repair of lysosomal membrane. At 
later stages, LGALS3 cooperates with TRIM16, an autophagy receptor-regulator, to 
engage autophagy machinery in removal of excessively damaged lysosomes. In the 
absence of LGALS3, repair and autophagy are less efficient, whereas TFEB nuclear 
translocation increases to compensate lysosomal deficiency via de novo lysosomal 
biogenesis. The MERIT system protects endomembrane integrity against a broad 
spectrum of agents damaging the endolysosomal network including lysosomotropic 
drugs, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or neurotoxic MAPT/tau.]]></TEXT>

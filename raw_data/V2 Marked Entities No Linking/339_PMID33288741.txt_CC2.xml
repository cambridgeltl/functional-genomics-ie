The E3 ligase UBR2 regulates cell death under caspase deficiency via Erk/MAPK 
pathway.

Escape from cell death is a key event in cancer establishment/progression. While 
apoptosis is often considered as the main cell death pathway, upon caspase 
inhibition, cell death is rather delayed than blocked leading to 
caspase-independent cell death (CICD). Although described for years, CICD's 
underlying mechanism remains to be identified. Here, we performed a genome-wide 
siRNA lethality screening and identified the RING-Type E3 Ubiquitin Transferase 
(UBR2) as a specific regulator of CICD. Strikingly, UBR2 downregulation 
sensitized cells towards CICD while its overexpression was protective. We 
established that UBR2-dependent protection from CICD was mediated by the 
MAPK/Erk pathway. We then observed that UBR2 is overexpressed in several 
cancers, especially in breast cancers and contributes to CICD resistance. 
Therefore, our work defines UBR2 as a novel regulator of CICD, found 
overexpressed in cancer cells, suggesting that its targeting may represent an 
innovative way to kill tumor cells.]]></TEXT>

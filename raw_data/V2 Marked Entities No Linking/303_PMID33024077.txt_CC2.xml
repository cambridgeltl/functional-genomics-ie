death.

Amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulates within neurons in the brains of early stage 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the mechanism underlying its 
toxicity remains unclear. Here, a triple omics approach was used to integrate 
transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data collected from a nerve cell 
model of the toxic intracellular aggregation of Aβ. It was found that 
intracellular Aβ induces profound changes in the omics landscape of nerve cells 
that are associated with a pro-inflammatory, metabolic reprogramming that 
predisposes cells to die via the oxytosis/ferroptosis regulated cell death 
pathway. Notably, the degenerative process included substantial alterations in 
glucose metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Our findings have 
implications for the understanding of the basic biology of proteotoxicity, 
aging, and AD as well as for the development of future therapeutic interventions 
designed to target the oxytosis/ferroptosis regulated cell death pathway in the 
AD brain.]]></TEXT>

targeting Fbxl19.

Fat storage in adult mammals is a highly regulated process that involves the 
mobilization of adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) that differentiate to produce 
new adipocytes. Here we report a role for the broadly conserved miR-26 family of 
microRNAs (miR-26a-1, miR-26a-2, and miR-26b) as major regulators of APC 
differentiation and adipose tissue mass. Deletion of all miR-26-encoding loci in 
mice resulted in a dramatic expansion of adipose tissue in adult animals fed 
normal chow. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of miR-26a protected mice 
from high-fat diet-induced obesity. These effects were attributable to a 
cell-autonomous function of miR-26 as a potent inhibitor of APC differentiation. 
miR-26 blocks adipogenesis, at least in part, by repressing expression of 
Fbxl19, a conserved miR-26 target without a previously known role in adipocyte 
biology that encodes a component of SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. 
These findings have therefore revealed a novel pathway that plays a critical 
role in regulating adipose tissue formation in vivo and suggest new potential 
therapeutic targets for obesity and related disorders.]]></TEXT>

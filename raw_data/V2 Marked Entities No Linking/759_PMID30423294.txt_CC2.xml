Cells.

In this study we interrogated the metabolome of human acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) stem cells to elucidate properties relevant to therapeutic intervention. 
We demonstrate that amino acid uptake, steady-state levels, and catabolism are 
all elevated in the leukemia stem cell (LSC) population. Furthermore, LSCs 
isolated from de novo AML patients are uniquely reliant on amino acid metabolism 
for oxidative phosphorylation and survival. Pharmacological inhibition of amino 
acid metabolism reduces oxidative phosphorylation and induces cell death. In 
contrast, LSCs obtained from relapsed AML patients are not reliant on amino acid 
metabolism due to their ability to compensate through increased fatty acid 
metabolism. These findings indicate that clinically relevant eradication of LSCs 
can be achieved with drugs that target LSC metabolic vulnerabilities.]]></TEXT>

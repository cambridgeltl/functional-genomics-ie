Cutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, 
cellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that 
exacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory 
M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. 
Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to 
injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we 
investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated 
sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we 
demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained 
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in 
myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression 
corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron 
microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following 
vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy 
increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented 
vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective 
deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin 
D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. 
Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, 
Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a 
similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, 
identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of 
skin from UV damage.]]></TEXT>

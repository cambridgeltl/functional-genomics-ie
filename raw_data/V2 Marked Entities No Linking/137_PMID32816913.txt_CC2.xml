Cancer.

Cancer chemoresistance is often attributed to the presence of cancer stem cell 
(CSC)-like cells, but whether they are homogeneously chemoresistant remains 
unclear. We previously showed that in colon tumors, a subpopulation of LGR5+ 
CSC-like cells driven by TCF1 (TCF7), a Wnt-responsive transcription factor, 
were responsible for tumorigenicity. Here we demonstrate that the tumorigenic 
subpopulation of mouse LGR5+ cells exists in a slow-cycling state and identify a 
unique 22-gene signature that characterizes these slow-cycling CSC. Seven of the 
signature genes are specifically expressed in slow-cycling LGR5+ cells from 
xenografted human colon tumors and are upregulated in colon cancer clinical 
specimens. Among these seven, four genes (APCDD1, NOTUM, PROX1, and SP5) are 
known to be direct Wnt target genes, and PROX1 was expressed in the invasive 
fronts of colon tumors. PROX1 was activated by TCF1 to induce CDKN1C and 
maintain a slow-cycling state in colon cancer organoids. Strikingly, PROX1 was 
required for recurrent growth after chemotherapeutic treatment, suggesting that 
inhibition of slow-cycling CSC by targeting the TCF1-PROX1-CDKN1C pathway is an 
effective strategy to combat refractory colon cancer in combination with 
conventional chemotherapy. ]]></TEXT>

<TEXT><![CDATA[UBAP2L arginine methylation by PRMT1 modulates stress granule assembly.

Stress granules (SGs) are discrete assemblies of stalled messenger 
ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) that form when eukaryotic cells encounter 
environmental stress. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) mediate their condensation by 
recruiting populations of mRNPs. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms 
underlying the role of ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) in the 
regulation of SG dynamics remain elusive. Here, we show that UBAP2L is required 
for both SG assembly and disassembly. UBAP2L overexpression nucleated SGs under 
stress-null conditions. The UBAP2L Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motif was required for SG 
competence, and mediated the recruitment of SG components, including mRNPs, 
RBPs, and ribosomal subunits. The domain of unknown function (DUF) of 
UBAP2L-mediated interaction with ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein 
(G3BP)1/2, and its deletion caused the cytoplasmic-nuclear transport of UBAP2L 
and G3BP1/2, thereby compromising SG formation. The protein arginine 
methyltransferase PRMT1 asymmetrically dimethylated UBAP2L by targeting the RGG 
motif. Increased arginine methylation blocked, whereas its decrease enhanced 
UBAP2L interactions with SG components, ablating and promoting SG assembly, 
respectively. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which 
UBAP2L regulates SG dynamics and RNA metabolism.]]></TEXT>

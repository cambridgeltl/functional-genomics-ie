<TEXT><![CDATA[KRAS-IRF2 Axis Drives Immune Suppression and Immune Therapy Resistance in 
Colorectal Cancer.

The biological functions and mechanisms of oncogenic KRASG12D (KRAS∗) in 
resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy are not fully understood. 
We demonstrate that KRAS∗ represses the expression of interferon regulatory 
factor 2 (IRF2), which in turn directly represses CXCL3 expression. 
KRAS∗-mediated repression of IRF2 results in high expression of CXCL3, which 
binds to CXCR2 on myeloid-derived suppressor cells and promotes their migration 
to the tumor microenvironment. Anti-PD-1 resistance of KRAS∗-expressing tumors 
can be overcome by enforced IRF2 expression or by inhibition of CXCR2. 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) showing higher IRF2 expression exhibited increased 
responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy. The KRAS∗-IRF2-CXCL3-CXCR2 axis provides a 
framework for patient selection and combination therapies to enhance the 
effectiveness of ICB therapy in CRC.]]></TEXT>

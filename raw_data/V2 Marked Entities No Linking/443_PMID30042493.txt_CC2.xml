anti-apoptotic activity of BCL2A1.

BCL2A1 is an anti-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family that contributes to 
chemoresistance in a subset of tumors. BCL2A1 has a short half-life due to its 
constitutive processing by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This constitutes a 
major tumor-suppressor mechanism regulating BCL2A1 function. However, the 
enzymes involved in the regulation of BCL2A1 protein stability are currently 
unknown. Here, we provide the first insight into the regulation of BCL2A1 
ubiquitination. We present evidence that TRIM28 is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase for 
BCL2A1. Indeed, endogenous TRIM28 and BCL2A1 bind to each other at the 
mitochondria and TRIM28 knock-down decreases BCL2A1 ubiquitination. We also show 
that TRIM17 stabilizes BCL2A1 by blocking TRIM28 from binding and ubiquitinating 
BCL2A1, and that GSK3 is involved in the phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of 
BCL2A1 degradation. BCL2A1 and its close relative MCL1 are thus regulated by 
common factors but with opposite outcome. Finally, overexpression of TRIM28 or 
knock-out of TRIM17 reduced BCLA1 protein levels and restored sensitivity of 
melanoma cells to BRAF-targeted therapy. Therefore, our data describe a 
molecular rheostat in which two proteins of the TRIM family antagonistically 
regulate BCL2A1 stability and modulate cell death.]]></TEXT>

of human breast cancer cells.

Lack of effective treatments for aggressive breast cancer is still a major 
global health problem. We have previously reported that photodynamic therapy 
using methylene blue as photosensitizer (MB-PDT) massively kills metastatic 
human breast cancer, marginally affecting healthy cells. In this study, we aimed 
to unveil the molecular mechanisms behind MB-PDT effectiveness and specificity 
towards tumor cells. Through lipidomics and biochemical approaches, we 
demonstrated that MB-PDT efficiency and specificity rely on polyunsaturated 
fatty acid-enriched membranes and on the better capacity to deal with 
photo-oxidative damage displayed by non-tumorigenic cells. We found out that, in 
tumorigenic cells, lysosome membrane permeabilization is accompanied by 
ferroptosis and/or necroptosis. Our results also pointed at a cross-talk between 
lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD) and necroptosis induction after 
photo-oxidation, and contributed to broaden the understanding of MB-PDT-induced 
mechanisms and specificity in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we demonstrated 
that efficient approaches could be designed on the basis of lipid composition 
and metabolic features for hard-to-treat cancers. The results further reinforce 
MB-PDT as a therapeutic strategy for highly aggressive human breast cancer 
cells.]]></TEXT>

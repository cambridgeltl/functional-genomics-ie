<TEXT><![CDATA[Ionizing radiation results in a mixture of cellular outcomes including mitotic 
catastrophe, senescence, methuosis, and iron-dependent cell death.

Radiotherapy is commonly used as a cytotoxic treatment of a wide variety of 
tumors. Interestingly, few case reports underlined its potential to induce 
immune-mediated abscopal effects, resulting in regression of metastases, distant 
from the irradiated site. These observations are rare, and apparently depend on 
the dose used, suggesting that dose-related cellular responses may be involved 
in the distant immunogenic responses. Ionizing radiation (IR) has been reported 
to elicit immunogenic apoptosis, necroptosis, mitotic catastrophe, and 
senescence. In order to link a cellular outcome with a particular dose of 
irradiation, we performed a systematic study in a panel of cell lines on the 
cellular responses at different doses of X-rays. Remarkably, we observed that 
all cell lines tested responded in a similar fashion to IR with characteristics 
of mitotic catastrophe, senescence, lipid peroxidation, and caspase activity. 
Iron chelators (but not Ferrostatin-1 or vitamin E) could prevent the formation 
of lipid peroxides and cell death induced by IR, suggesting a crucial role of 
iron-dependent cell death during high-dose irradiation. We also show that in 
K-Ras-mutated cells, IR can induce morphological features reminiscent of 
methuosis, a cell death modality that has been recently described following 
H-Ras or K-Ras mutation overexpression.

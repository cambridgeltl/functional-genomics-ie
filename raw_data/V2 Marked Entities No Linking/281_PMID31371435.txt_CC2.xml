<TEXT><![CDATA[Defining the influence of Rad51 and Dmc1 lineage-specific amino acids on genetic 
recombination.

The vast majority of eukaryotes possess two DNA recombinases: Rad51, which is 
ubiquitously expressed, and Dmc1, which is meiosis-specific. The evolutionary 
origins of this two-recombinase system remain poorly understood. Interestingly, 
Dmc1 can stabilize mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Rad51 cannot. 
Here, we demonstrate that this difference can be attributed to three amino acids 
conserved only within the Dmc1 lineage of the Rad51/RecA family. Chimeric Rad51 
mutants harboring Dmc1-specific amino acids gain the ability to stabilize 
heteroduplex DNA joints with mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Dmc1 
mutants with Rad51-specific amino acids lose this ability. Remarkably, RAD-51 
from Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism without Dmc1, has acquired "Dmc1-like" 
amino acids. Chimeric C. elegans RAD-51 harboring "canonical" Rad51 amino acids 
gives rise to toxic recombination intermediates, which must be actively 
dismantled to permit normal meiotic progression. We propose that Dmc1 
lineage-specific amino acids involved in the stabilization of heteroduplex DNA 
joints with mismatch-containing base triplets may contribute to normal meiotic 
recombination.]]></TEXT>

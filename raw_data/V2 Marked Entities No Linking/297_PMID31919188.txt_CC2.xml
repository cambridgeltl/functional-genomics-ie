<TEXT><![CDATA[The chromatin remodeler Snf2h is essential for oocyte meiotic cell cycle 
progression.

Oocytes are indispensable for mammalian life. Thus, it is important to 
understand how mature oocytes are generated. As a critical stage of oocytes 
development, meiosis has been extensively studied, yet how chromatin remodeling 
contributes to this process is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the 
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor Snf2h (also known as Smarca5) plays a 
critical role in regulating meiotic cell cycle progression. Females with 
oocyte-specific depletion of Snf2h are infertile and oocytes lacking Snf2h fail 
to undergo meiotic resumption. Mechanistically, depletion of Snf2h results in 
dysregulation of meiosis-related genes, which causes failure of 
maturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation. ATAC-seq analysis in oocytes 
revealed that Snf2h regulates transcription of key meiotic genes, such as 
Prkar2b, by increasing its promoter chromatin accessibility. Thus, our studies 
not only demonstrate the importance of Snf2h in oocyte meiotic resumption, but 
also reveal the mechanism underlying how a chromatin remodeling factor can 
regulate oocyte meiosis.]]></TEXT>

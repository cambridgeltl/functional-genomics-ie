the Hippo Pathway.

Cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (CDK4/6i) are effective in 
breast cancer; however, drug resistance is frequently encountered and poorly 
understood. We conducted a genomic analysis of 348 estrogen receptor-positive 
(ER+) breast cancers treated with CDK4/6i and identified loss-of-function 
mutations affecting FAT1 and RB1 linked to drug resistance. FAT1 loss led to 
marked elevations in CDK6, the suppression of which restored sensitivity to 
CDK4/6i. The induction of CDK6 was mediated by the Hippo pathway with 
accumulation of YAP and TAZ transcription factors on the CDK6 promoter. Genomic 
alterations in other Hippo pathway components were also found to promote CDK4/6i 
resistance. These findings uncover a tumor suppressor function of Hippo 
signaling in ER+ breast cancer and establish FAT1 loss as a mechanism of 
resistance to CDK4/6i.]]></TEXT>

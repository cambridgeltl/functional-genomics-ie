<TEXT><![CDATA[Defining the Teratoma as a Model for Multi-lineage Human Development.

We propose that the teratoma, a recognized standard for validating pluripotency 
in stem cells, could be a promising platform for studying human developmental 
processes. Performing single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 179,632 cells 
across 23 teratomas from 4 cell lines, we found that teratomas reproducibly 
contain approximately 20 cell types across all 3 germ layers, that 
inter-teratoma cell type heterogeneity is comparable with organoid systems, and 
teratoma gut and brain cell types correspond well to similar fetal cell types. 
Furthermore, cellular barcoding confirmed that injected stem cells robustly 
engraft and contribute to all lineages. Using pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knockout 
screens, we showed that teratomas can enable simultaneous assaying of the 
effects of genetic perturbations across all germ layers. Additionally, we 
demonstrated that teratomas can be sculpted molecularly via microRNA 
(miRNA)-regulated suicide gene expression to enrich for specific tissues. Taken 
together, teratomas are a promising platform for modeling multi-lineage 
development, pan-tissue functional genetic screening, and tissue engineering.]]></TEXT>

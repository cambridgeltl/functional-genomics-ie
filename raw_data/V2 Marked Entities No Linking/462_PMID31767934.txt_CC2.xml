metastasis.

Lung cancer is one of the cancers with highest morbidity and mortality rates and 
the metastasis of lung cancer is a leading cause of death. Mechanisms of lung 
cancer metastasis are yet to be fully understood. Herein, we demonstrate that 
mice deficient for REGγ, a proteasome activator, exhibited a significant 
reduction in tumor size, numbers, and metastatic rate with prolonged survival in 
a conditional Kras/p53 mutant lung cancer model. REGγ enhanced the TGFβ-Smad 
signaling pathway by ubiquitin-ATP-independent degradation of Smad7, an 
inhibitor of the TGFβ pathway. Activated TGFβ signaling in REGγ-positive lung 
cancer cells led to diminished expression of E-cadherin, a biomarker of 
epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), and elevated mesenchymal markers 
compared with REGγ-deficient lung cancer cells. REGγ overexpression was found in 
lung cancer patients with metastasis, correlating with the reduction of 
E-Cadherin/Smad7 and a poor prognosis. Overall, our study indicates that REGγ 
promotes lung cancer metastasis by activating TGF-β signaling via degradation of 
Smad7. Thus, REGγ may serve as a novel therapeutic target for lung cancers with 
poor prognosis.]]></TEXT>

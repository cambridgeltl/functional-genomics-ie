<TEXT><![CDATA[Hypertonicity primes malignant melanoma cells for apoptosis.

The tumor environment critically influences responsiveness of cancer cells to 
chemotherapies, most of which activate the mitochondria-regulated (intrinsic) 
apoptotic cascade to kill malignant cells. Especially skin tumors encounter an 
environment with remarkable biophysical properties. Cutaneous accumulation of 
Na+ locally establishes osmotic pressure gradients in vivo (hypertonicity or 
hyperosmotic stress), but whether cutaneous hypertonicity is a factor that 
modulates the responsiveness of skin cancers to therapeutic apoptosis-induction 
has thus far not been investigated. Here, we show that hyperosmotic stress 
lowers the threshold for apoptosis induction in malignant melanoma, the 
deadliest form of skin cancer. Hypertonic conditions enforce addiction to 
BCL-2-like proteins to prevent initiation of the mitochondria-regulated 
(intrinsic) apoptotic pathway. Essentially, hyperosmotic stress primes 
mitochondria for death. Our work identifies osmotic pressure in the tumor 
microenvironment as a cell extrinsic factor that modulates responsiveness of 
malignant melanoma cells to therapy.]]></TEXT>

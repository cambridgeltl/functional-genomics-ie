signaling in ovarian cancer cells.

Ovarian cancer remains one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related death 
in women. Many patients with ovarian cancer suffer from de novo or acquired 
resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we report that RAB25 suppresses 
chemotherapy-induced mitochondrial apoptosis signaling in ovarian cancer cell 
lines and primary ovarian cancer cells. RAB25 blocks chemotherapy-induced 
apoptosis upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by either 
increasing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins or decreasing proapoptotic BCL-2 
proteins. In particular, BAX expression negatively correlates with RAB25 
expression in ovarian cancer cells. BH3 profiling assays corroborated that RAB25 
decreases mitochondrial cell death priming. Suppressing RAB25 by means of RNAi 
or RFP14 inhibitory hydrocarbon-stapled peptide sensitizes ovarian cancer cells 
to chemotherapy as well as RAB25-mediated proliferation, invasion and migration. 
Our data suggest that RAB25 is a potential therapeutic target for ovarian 
cancer.]]></TEXT>

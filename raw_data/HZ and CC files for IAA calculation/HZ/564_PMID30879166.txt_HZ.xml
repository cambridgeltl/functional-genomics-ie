apoptosis induced by palmitic acid.

Lipoapoptosis of cardiomyocytes may underlie diabetic cardiomyopathy. Numerous 
forms of cardiomyopathies share a common end-pathway in which apoptotic loss of 
cardiomyocytes is mediated by p38α mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). 
Although we have previously shown that palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty 
acid (SFA) elevated in plasma of type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity, 
induces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via p38α MAPK-dependent signaling, the 
downstream cascade events that cause cell death remain unknown. The objective of 
this study was to investigate mechanisms involved in palmitic acid-induced 
cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte line (AC16 cells) 
exposed to high physiological levels of PA for 16 h showed enhanced 
transcription and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun subunits of AP-1 and 
transcription of caspase 8. When AC16 cells were transfected with small 
interfering RNA specific against p38α MAPK (si-p38α) for 24 or 48 h, the 
amplified phosphorylation of c-fos was dose-dependently attenuated, and 
procaspase 8 was dose-dependently reduced. With translational knockdown of 
c-fos, PA-induced apoptosis was diminished. Inhibition of caspase 8 for 24 h 
reduced apoptosis in PA-treated cardiomyocytes. These findings provide evidence 
for induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to high SFA by a novel 
pathway requiring activation of c-fos/AP-1 and caspase 8. These results 
demonstrate how elevated plasma SFA may lead to continual and cumulative loss of 
cardiomyocytes and potentially contribute to the development of diabetic 
cardiomyopathy.]]></TEXT>

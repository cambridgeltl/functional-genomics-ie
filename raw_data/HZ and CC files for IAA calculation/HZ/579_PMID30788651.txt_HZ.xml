regulated cell death.

Currently the study of Regulated Cell Death (RCD) processes is limited to the 
use of lysed cell populations for Western blot analysis of each separate RCD 
process. We have previously shown that intracellular antigen flow cytometric 
analysis of RIP3, Caspase-3 and cell viability dye allowed the determination of 
levels of apoptosis (Caspase-3+ ve/RIP3- ve), necroptosis 
(RIP3Hi + ve/Caspase-3- ve) and RIP1-dependent apoptosis 
(Caspase-3+ ve/RIP3+ ve) in a single Jurkat cell population. The addition of 
more intracellular markers allows the determination of the incidence of 
parthanatos (PARP), DNA Damage Response (DDR, H2AX), H2AX hyper-activation of 
PARP (H2AX/PARP) autophagy (LC3B) and ER stress (PERK), thus allowing the 
identification of 124 sub-populations both within live and dead cell 
populations. Shikonin simultaneously induced Jurkat cell apoptosis and 
necroptosis the degree of which can be shown flow cytometrically together with 
the effects of blockade of these forms of cell death by zVAD and necrostatin-1 
have on specific RCD populations including necroptosis, early and late apoptosis 
and RIP1-dependent apoptosis phenotypes in live and dead cells. Necrostatin-1 
and zVAD was shown to modulate levels of shikonin induced DDR, hyper-action of 
PARP and parthanatos in the four forms of RCD processes analysed. LC3B was 
up-regulated by combined treatment of zVAD with chloroquine which also revealed 
that DNA damage was reduced in live cells but enhanced in dead cells indicating 
the role of autophagy in maintaining cell health. This approach to RCD research 
should be a great advance to understanding the mechanisms of drugs and their 
effects upon RCD populations.

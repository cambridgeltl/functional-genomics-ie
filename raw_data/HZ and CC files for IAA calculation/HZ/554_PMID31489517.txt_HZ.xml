<TEXT><![CDATA[Defining the role of cytoskeletal components in the formation of apoptopodia and 
apoptotic bodies during apoptosis.

During apoptosis, dying cells undergo dynamic morphological changes that 
ultimately lead to their disassembly into fragments called apoptotic bodies 
(ApoBDs). Reorganisation of the cytoskeletal structures is key in driving 
various apoptotic morphologies, including the loss of cell adhesion and membrane 
bleb formation. However, whether cytoskeletal components are also involved in 
morphological changes that occur later during apoptosis, such as the recently 
described generation of thin apoptotic membrane protrusions called apoptopodia 
and subsequent ApoBD formation, is not well defined. Through monitoring the 
progression of apoptosis by confocal microscopy, specifically focusing on the 
apoptopodia formation step, we characterised the presence of F-actin and 
microtubules in a subset of apoptopodia generated by T cells and monocytes. 
Interestingly, targeting actin polymerisation and microtubule assembly 
pharmacologically had no major effect on apoptopodia formation. These data 
demonstrate apoptopodia as a novel type of membrane protrusion that could be 
formed in the absence of actin polymerisation and microtubule assembly.]]></TEXT>

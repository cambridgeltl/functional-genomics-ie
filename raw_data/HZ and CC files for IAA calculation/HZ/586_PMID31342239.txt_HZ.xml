esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most malignant tumors in 
east Asia. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its progression remains 
unclear. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a central mechanism for 
protein degradation and turnover. Accumulating evidence showed that more and 
more deubiquitinases could serve as attractive anti-cancer target. The 
expression of USP14 and UCH37 in esophagus squamous cell carcinoma tissues were 
examined by immunohistochemistry and western blot assays. Effect of b-AP15, a 
USP14 and UCH37 inhibitor, on ESCC cell growth was evaluated by cell viability 
assay. After cell lines being treated with b-AP15, cell cycle, apoptosis and the 
expression of related proteins were further explored to investigate the 
anti-ESCC mechanism of b-AP15. Results showed that deubiquitinating enzymes 
(DUBs) USP14 and UCH37 expressed at higher levels in ESCC tissues than in 
adjacent tissues. b-AP15 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce G2/M cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, b-AP15 treatment 
triggered Noxa-dependent apoptosis, which was regulated by c-Myc. Silencing Noxa 
and c-Myc could reduce b-AP15-induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Our results 
revealed a novel mechanism of anti-tumor activity of b-AP15 in ESCC, and b-AP15 
could be used as a potential therapeutic agent in ESCC.]]></TEXT>

        "TEXT": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a potentially fatal condition characterized by granulomatous lesions with characteristic clonal mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) harboring activating somatic mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes, most notably BRAFV600E. We recently discovered that the BRAFV600E mutation can also affect multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in multisystem LCH disease. How the BRAFV600E mutation in HPCs leads to LCH is not known. Here we show that enforced expression of the BRAFV600E mutation in early mouse and human multipotent HPCs induced a senescence program that led to HPC growth arrest, apoptosis resistance and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP, in turn, promoted HPC skewing toward the MNP lineage, leading to the accumulation of senescent MNPs in tissue and the formation of LCH lesions. Accordingly, elimination of senescent cells using INK-ATTAC transgenic mice, as well as pharmacologic blockade of SASP, improved LCH disease in mice. These results identify senescent cells as a new target for the treatment of LCH.",

Dystrophin-related protein (or utrophin) retains most of the structural and protein binding elements of dystrophin5. Importantly, normal thymic expression in DMD patients6 should protect utrophin by central immunologic tolerance. We designed a codon-optimized, synthetic transgene encoding a miniaturized utrophin (µUtro), deliverable by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Here, we show that µUtro is a highly functional, non-immunogenic substitute for dystrophin, preventing the most deleterious histological and physiological aspects of muscular dystrophy in small and large animal models. Following systemic administration of an AAV-µUtro to neonatal dystrophin-deficient mdx mice, histological and biochemical markers of myonecrosis and regeneration are completely suppressed throughout growth to adult weight. In the dystrophin-deficient golden retriever model, µUtro non-toxically prevented myonecrosis, even in the most powerful muscles. In a stringent test of immunogenicity, focal expression of µUtro in the deletional-null German shorthaired pointer model produced no evidence of cell-mediated immunity, in contrast to the robust T cell response against similarly constructed µDystrophin (µDystro). These findings support a model in which utrophin-derived therapies might be used to treat clinical dystrophin deficiency, with a favorable immunologic profile and preserved function in the face of extreme miniaturization.",

Expression of programmed death ligand 1 in tumor microenvironments is a major immune checkpoint for tumor-specific T cell responses as it binds to programmed cell death protein-1 on activated and dysfunctional T cells1. The activity of myeloid cells such as macrophages and neutrophils is likewise regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. In particular, cell surface expression of the CD47 protein creates a 'don't eat me' signal on tumor cells by binding to SIRPα expressed on myeloid cells2-5. Using a haploid genetic screen, we here identify glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase-like protein (QPCTL) as a major component of the CD47-SIRPα checkpoint. Biochemical analysis demonstrates that QPCTL is critical for pyroglutamate formation on CD47 at the SIRPα binding site shortly after biosynthesis. Genetic and pharmacological interference with QPCTL activity enhances antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity of tumor cells. Furthermore, interference with QPCTL expression leads to a major increase in neutrophil-mediated killing of tumor cells in vivo. These data identify QPCTL as a novel target to interfere with the CD47 pathway and thereby augment antibody therapy of cancer.",

Downstream of KRAS, the RAF→MEK→ERK signaling pathway plays a central role in pancreatic carcinogenesis5. However, paradoxically, inhibition of this pathway has provided no clinical benefit to patients with PDA6. Here we show that inhibition of KRAS→RAF→MEK→ERK signaling elicits autophagy, a process of cellular recycling that protects PDA cells from the cytotoxic effects of KRAS pathway inhibition. Mechanistically, inhibition of MEK1/2 leads to activation of the LKB1→AMPK→ULK1 signaling axis, a key regulator of autophagy. Furthermore, combined inhibition of MEK1/2 plus autophagy displays synergistic anti-proliferative effects against PDA cell lines in vitro and promotes regression of xenografted patient-derived PDA tumors in mice. The observed effect of combination trametinib plus chloroquine was not restricted to PDA as other tumors, including patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of NRAS-mutated melanoma and BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer displayed similar responses. Finally, treatment of a patient with PDA with the combination of trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine resulted in a partial, but nonetheless striking disease response. These data suggest that this combination therapy may represent a novel strategy to target RAS-driven cancers.",

Here, we apply a multistage, systems biology approach to elucidate the disease mechanisms in frontotemporal dementia. We identify two gene coexpression modules that are preserved in mice harboring mutations in MAPT, GRN and other dementia mutations on diverse genetic backgrounds. We bridge the species divide via integration with proteomic and transcriptomic data from the human brain to identify evolutionarily conserved, disease-relevant networks. We find that overexpression of miR-203, a hub of a putative regulatory microRNA (miRNA) module, recapitulates mRNA coexpression patterns associated with disease state and induces neuronal cell death, establishing this miRNA as a regulator of neurodegeneration. Using a database of drug-mediated gene expression changes, we identify small molecules that can normalize the disease-associated modules and validate this experimentally.

It is also well established that KRAS-mutant tumors are insensitive to inhibition of upstream growth factor receptor signaling. Thus, epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy is only effective in KRAS wild-type colon cancers9,10. Consistently, inhibition of SHP2 (also known as PTPN11), which links receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway11,12, was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant or BRAF-mutant cancer cell lines13. Our data also indicate that SHP2 inhibition in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells under normal cell culture conditions has little effect. By contrast, SHP2 inhibition under growth factor-limiting conditions in vitro results in a senescence response. In vivo, inhibition of SHP2 in KRAS-mutant NSCLC also provokes a senescence response, which is exacerbated by MEK inhibition. Our data identify SHP2 inhibition as an unexpected vulnerability of KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells that remains undetected in cell culture and can be exploited therapeutically.",

Ex vivo metabolic profiling revealed altered sphingolipid, hexose, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism in Glut1-deficient keratinocytes, thus suggesting metabolic adaptation. However, cultured Glut1-deficient keratinocytes displayed metabolic and oxidative stress and impaired proliferation. Similarly, Glut1 deficiency impaired in vivo keratinocyte proliferation and migration within wounded or UV-damaged mouse skin.

Topical application of a Glut1 inhibitor also decreased inflammation in these models. Glut1 inhibition decreased the expression of pathology-associated genes in human psoriatic skin organoids.

        "TEXT": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer diagnosed in more than 200,000 women each year and is recalcitrant to targeted therapies. Although TNBCs harbor multiple hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), RTK inhibitors have been largely ineffective in TNBC patients thus far. We developed a broadly effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC that is based on combined inhibition of receptors that share the negative regulator PTPN12. Previously, we and others identified the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 as a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in TNBC. PTPN12 restrains several RTKs, suggesting that PTPN12 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of multiple RTKs and a co-dependency on these receptors. This in turn leads to the therapeutic hypothesis that PTPN12-deficient TNBCs may be responsive to combined RTK inhibition. However, the repertoire of RTKs that are restrained by PTPN12 in human cells has not been systematically explored. By methodically identifying the suite of RTK substrates (MET, PDGFRβ, EGFR, and others) inhibited by PTPN12, we rationalized a combination RTK-inhibitor therapy that induced potent tumor regression across heterogeneous models of TNBC. Orthogonal approaches revealed that PTPN12 was recruited to and inhibited these receptors after ligand stimulation, thereby serving as a feedback mechanism to limit receptor signaling. Cancer-associated mutation of PTPN12 or reduced PTPN12 protein levels diminished this feedback mechanism, leading to aberrant activity of these receptors. Restoring PTPN12 protein levels restrained signaling from RTKs, including PDGFRβ and MET, and impaired TNBC survival. In contrast with single agents, combined inhibitors targeting the PDGFRβ and MET receptors induced the apoptosis in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. This therapeutic strategy resulted in tumor regressions in chemo-refractory patient-derived TNBC models. Notably, response correlated with PTPN12 deficiency, suggesting that impaired receptor feedback may establish a combined addiction to these proto-oncogenic receptors. Taken together, our data provide a rationale",

Here, we investigate the contribution of enhancer elements to the metastatic phenotype of osteosarcoma. Through epigenomic profiling, we identify substantial differences in enhancer activity between primary and metastatic human tumors and between near isogenic pairs of highly lung metastatic and nonmetastatic osteosarcoma cell lines. We term these regions metastatic variant enhancer loci (Met-VELs). Met-VELs drive coordinated waves of gene expression during metastatic colonization of the lung. Met-VELs cluster nonrandomly in the genome, indicating that activity of these enhancers and expression of their associated gene targets are positively selected. As evidence of this causal association, osteosarcoma lung metastasis is inhibited by global interruptions of Met-VEL-associated gene expression via pharmacologic BET inhibition, by knockdown of AP-1 transcription factors that occupy Met-VELs, and by knockdown or functional inhibition of individual genes activated by Met-VELs, such as that encoding coagulation factor III/tissue factor (F3). We further show that genetic deletion of a single Met-VEL at the F3 locus blocks metastatic cell outgrowth in the lung. These findings indicate that Met-VELs and the genes they regulate play a functional role in metastasis and may be suitable targets for antimetastatic therapies.",

        "TEXT": "Treating KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge in cancer treatment given the difficulties associated with directly inhibiting the KRAS oncoprotein. One approach to addressing this challenge is to define mutations that frequently co-occur with those in KRAS, which themselves may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities in tumors. Approximately 20% of KRAS-mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP1 gene encoding Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (refs. 2, 3, 4), a negative regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; hereafter NRF2), which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response. The high frequency of mutations in KEAP1 suggests an important role for the oxidative stress response in lung tumorigenesis. Using a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach in a mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD, we examined the effects of Keap1 loss in lung cancer progression. We show that loss of Keap1 hyperactivates NRF2 and promotes KRAS-driven LUAD in mice. Through a combination of CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolomic analyses, we show that Keap1- or Nrf2-mutant cancers are dependent on increased glutaminolysis, and this property can be therapeutically exploited through the pharmacological inhibition of glutaminase. Finally, we provide a rationale for stratification of human patients with lung cancer harboring KRAS/KEAP1- or KRAS/NRF2-mutant lung tumors as likely to respond to glutaminase inhibition.",

        "TEXT": "A deeper understanding of the metastatic process is required for the development of new therapies that improve patient survival. Metastatic tumor cell growth and survival in distant organs is facilitated by the formation of a pre-metastatic niche that is composed of hematopoietic cells, stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). Perivascular cells, including vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs) and pericytes, are involved in new vessel formation and in promoting stem cell maintenance and proliferation. Given the well-described plasticity of perivascular cells, we hypothesized that perivascular cells similarly regulate tumor cell fate at metastatic sites. We used perivascular-cell-specific and pericyte-specific lineage-tracing models to trace the fate of perivascular cells in the pre-metastatic and metastatic microenvironments. We show that perivascular cells lose the expression of traditional vSMC and pericyte markers in response to tumor-secreted factors and exhibit increased proliferation, migration and ECM synthesis. Increased expression of the pluripotency gene Klf4 in these phenotypically switched perivascular cells promoted a less differentiated state, characterized by enhanced ECM production, that established a pro-metastatic fibronectin-rich environment. Genetic inactivation of Klf4 in perivascular cells decreased formation of a pre-metastatic niche and metastasis. Our data revealed a previously unidentified role for perivascular cells in pre-metastatic niche formation and uncovered novel strategies for limiting metastasis.",

Here we show the formation of abundant new bone at peripheral cortical sites after intramedullary implantation of a pin containing ultrapure magnesium into the intact distal femur in rats. This response was accompanied by substantial increases of neuronal calcitonin gene-related polypeptide-α (CGRP) in both the peripheral cortex of the femur and the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Surgical removal of the periosteum, capsaicin denervation of sensory nerves or knockdown in vivo of the CGRP-receptor-encoding genes Calcrl or Ramp1 substantially reversed the magnesium-induced osteogenesis that we observed in this model. Overexpression of these genes, however, enhanced magnesium-induced osteogenesis. We further found that an elevation of extracellular magnesium induces magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1)-dependent and transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7)-dependent magnesium entry, as well as an increase in intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the accumulation of terminal synaptic vesicles in isolated rat DRG neurons. In isolated rat periosteum-derived stem cells, CGRP induces CALCRL- and RAMP1-dependent activation of cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) and SP7 (also known as osterix), and thus enhances osteogenic differentiation of these stem cells. Furthermore, we have developed an innovative, magnesium-containing intramedullary nail that facilitates femur fracture repair in rats with ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis. Taken together, these findings reveal a previously undefined role of magnesium in promoting CGRP-mediated osteogenic differentiation, which suggests the therapeutic potential of this ion in orthopedics.",

The two nonresponding PDXs showed hypermutated genomes with enrichment of mutations in DNA-repair genes, which suggests an association of genomic instability with therapeutic resistance.

We found that human PDACs with impaired epithelial transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling have high epithelial STAT3 activity and develop stiff, matricellular-enriched fibrosis associated with high epithelial tension and shorter patient survival. In several KRAS-driven mouse models, both the loss of TGF-β signaling and elevated β1-integrin mechanosignaling engaged a positive feedback loop whereby STAT3 signaling promotes tumor progression by increasing matricellular fibrosis and tissue tension. In contrast, epithelial STAT3 ablation attenuated tumor progression by reducing the stromal stiffening and epithelial contractility induced by loss of TGF-β signaling. In PDAC patient biopsies, higher matricellular protein and activated STAT3 were associated with SMAD4 mutation and shorter survival. The findings implicate epithelial tension and matricellular fibrosis in the aggressiveness of SMAD4 mutant pancreatic tumors and highlight STAT3 and mechanics as key drivers of this phenotype.",

To test a tumor suppressive role for PTEN in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we induced Cre-mediated deletion of Pten in mouse models of pre-B ALL. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, loss of one or both alleles of Pten caused rapid cell death of pre-B ALL cells and was sufficient to clear transplant recipient mice of leukemia. Small-molecule inhibition of PTEN in human pre-B ALL cells resulted in hyperactivation of AKT, activation of the p53 tumor suppressor cell cycle checkpoint and cell death. Loss of PTEN function in pre-B ALL cells was functionally equivalent to acute activation of autoreactive pre-B cell receptor signaling, which engaged a deletional checkpoint for the removal of autoreactive B cells. We propose that targeted inhibition of PTEN and hyperactivation of AKT triggers a checkpoint for the elimination of autoreactive B cells and represents a new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.",

        "TEXT": "Patients with advanced Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma are currently treated with standard chemotherapy because of a lack of efficacious targeted therapies. We reasoned that the identification of mediators of Kras signaling in early mouse lung hyperplasias might bypass the difficulties that are imposed by intratumor heterogeneity in advanced tumors, and that it might unveil relevant therapeutic targets. Transcriptional profiling of Kras(G12V)-driven mouse hyperplasias revealed intertumor diversity with a subset that exhibited an aggressive transcriptional profile analogous to that of advanced human adenocarcinomas. The top-scoring gene in this profile encodes the tyrosine kinase receptor DDR1. The genetic and pharmacological inhibition of DDR1 blocked tumor initiation and tumor progression, respectively. The concomitant inhibition of both DDR1 and Notch signaling induced the regression of KRAS;TP53-mutant patient-derived lung xenografts (PDX) with a therapeutic efficacy that was at least comparable to that of standard chemotherapy. Our data indicate that the combined inhibition of DDR1 and Notch signaling could be an effective targeted therapy for patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.",

Here we observe that acquired resistance caused by the EGFR(T790M) gatekeeper mutation can occur either by selection of pre-existing EGFR(T790M)-positive clones or via genetic evolution of initially EGFR(T790M)-negative drug-tolerant cells. The path to resistance impacts the biology of the resistant clone, as those that evolved from drug-tolerant cells had a diminished apoptotic response to third-generation EGFR inhibitors that target EGFR(T790M); treatment with navitoclax, an inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic factors BCL-xL and BCL-2 restored sensitivity. We corroborated these findings using cultures derived directly from EGFR inhibitor-resistant patient tumors. These findings provide evidence that clinically relevant drug-resistant cancer cells can both pre-exist and evolve from drug-tolerant cells, and they point to therapeutic opportunities to prevent or overcome resistance in the clinic.",

Whereas apoptotic signaling is well defined, the mechanisms that underlie cardiomyocyte necroptosis remain elusive. Here we show that receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3) triggers myocardial necroptosis, in addition to apoptosis and inflammation, through activation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) rather than through the well-established RIP3 partners RIP1 and MLKL. In mice, RIP3 deficiency or CaMKII inhibition ameliorates myocardial necroptosis and heart failure induced by ischemia-reperfusion or by doxorubicin treatment. RIP3-induced activation of CaMKII, via phosphorylation or oxidation or both, triggers opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and myocardial necroptosis. These findings identify CaMKII as a new RIP3 substrate and delineate a RIP3-CaMKII-mPTP myocardial necroptosis pathway, a promising target for the treatment of ischemia- and oxidative stress-induced myocardial damage and heart failure.",

The VPS35 gene, which encodes a key component of the membrane protein-recycling retromer complex, is the third autosomal-dominant gene associated with PD. However, how VPS35 mutations lead to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that PD-associated VPS35 mutations caused mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death in cultured neurons in vitro, in mouse substantia nigra neurons in vivo and in human fibroblasts from an individual with PD who has the VPS35(D620N) mutation. VPS35-induced mitochondrial deficits and neuronal dysfunction could be prevented by inhibition of mitochondrial fission. VPS35 mutants showed increased interaction with dynamin-like protein (DLP) 1, which enhanced turnover of the mitochondrial DLP1 complexes via the mitochondria-derived vesicle-dependent trafficking of the complexes to lysosomes for degradation. Notably, oxidative stress increased the VPS35-DLP1 interaction, which we also found to be increased in the brains of sporadic PD cases. These results revealed a novel cellular mechanism for the involvement of VPS35 in mitochondrial fission, dysregulation of which is probably involved in the pathogenesis of familial, and possibly sporadic, PD.",

Here we find that, during renal fibrosis, TECs acquire a partial EMT program during which they remain associated with their basement membrane and express markers of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. The functional consequence of the EMT program during fibrotic injury is an arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and lower expression of several solute and solvent transporters in TECs. We also found that transgenic expression of either Twist1 (encoding twist family bHLH transcription factor 1, known as Twist) or Snai1 (encoding snail family zinc finger 1, known as Snail) expression is sufficient to promote prolonged TGF-β1-induced G2 arrest of TECs, limiting the cells' potential for repair and regeneration. In mouse models of experimentally induced renal fibrosis, conditional deletion of Twist1 or Snai1 in proximal TECs resulted in inhibition of the EMT program and the maintenance of TEC integrity, while also restoring cell proliferation, dedifferentiation-associated repair and regeneration of the kidney parenchyma and attenuating interstitial fibrosis. Thus, inhibition of the EMT program in TECs during chronic renal injury represents a potential anti-fibrosis therapy.",

Conversely, mir-200 ablation in mice reduces beta cell apoptosis and ameliorates T2D. We show that miR-200 negatively regulates a conserved anti-apoptotic and stress-resistance network that includes the essential beta cell chaperone Dnajc3 (also known as p58IPK) and the caspase inhibitor Xiap. We also observed that mir-200 dosage positively controls activation of the tumor suppressor Trp53 and thereby creates a pro-apoptotic gene-expression signature found in islets of diabetic mice. Consequently, miR-200-induced T2D is suppressed by interfering with the signaling of Trp53 and Bax, a proapoptotic member of the B cell lymphoma 2 protein family. Our results reveal a crucial role for the miR-200 family in beta cell survival and the pathophysiology of diabetes.",

During osteoclast differentiation, a shift toward more oxidative metabolic processes occurs. In this study we identified the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) as a transcription factor that couples these metabolic changes to osteoclast differentiation. We also found that receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), an essential cytokine for osteoclastogenesis, induces this metabolic shift towards oxidative metabolism, which is accompanied by an increase in S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) production. We found that SAM-mediated DNA methylation by Dnmt3a regulates osteoclastogenesis via epigenetic repression of anti-osteoclastogenic genes. The importance of Dnmt3a in bone homeostasis was underscored by the observations that Dnmt3a-deficient osteoclast precursor cells do not differentiate efficiently into osteoclasts and that mice with an osteoclast-specific deficiency in Dnmt3a have elevated bone mass due to a smaller number of osteoclasts. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA methylation by theaflavin-3,3'-digallate abrogated bone loss in models of osteoporosis. Thus, this study reveals the role of epigenetic processes in the regulation of cellular metabolism and differentiation, which may provide the molecular basis for a new therapeutic strategy for a variety of bone disorders.",

Mutations in the FERMT-1 gene, which encodes for Kindlin-1, lead to Kindler syndrome in man, which is characterized by skin blistering, premature skin aging and skin cancer of unknown etiology. Here we show that loss of Kindlin-1 in mouse keratinocytes recapitulates Kindler syndrome and also produces enlarged and hyperactive stem cell compartments, which lead to hyperthickened epidermis, ectopic hair follicle development and increased skin tumor susceptibility. Mechanistically, Kindlin-1 controls keratinocyte adhesion through β1-class integrins and proliferation and differentiation of cutaneous epithelial stem cells by promoting α(v)β(6) integrin-mediated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) activation and inhibiting Wnt-β-catenin signaling through integrin-independent regulation of Wnt ligand expression. Our findings assign Kindlin-1 the previously unknown and essential task of controlling cutaneous epithelial stem cell homeostasis by balancing TGF-β-mediated growth-inhibitory signals and Wnt-β-catenin-mediated growth-promoting signals.",

Expression of BCAT1 was exclusive to tumors carrying wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 genes and was highly correlated with methylation patterns in the BCAT1 promoter region. BCAT1 expression was dependent on the concentration of α-ketoglutarate substrate in glioma cell lines and could be suppressed by ectopic overexpression of mutant IDH1 in immortalized human astrocytes, providing a link between IDH1 function and BCAT1 expression. Suppression of BCAT1 in glioma cell lines blocked the excretion of glutamate and led to reduced proliferation and invasiveness in vitro, as well as significant decreases in tumor growth in a glioblastoma xenograft model. These findings suggest a central role for BCAT1 in glioma pathogenesis, making BCAT1 and BCAA metabolism attractive targets for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches to treat patients with glioblastoma.",

Both hypercholesterolemia and increased platelet production promote atherothrombosis; however, a potential link between altered cholesterol homeostasis and platelet production has not been explored. Here we show that transplantation of bone marrow deficient in ABCG4, a transporter of unknown function, into Ldlr(-/-) mice resulted in thrombocytosis, accelerated thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Although not detected in atherosclerotic lesions, Abcg4 was highly expressed in bone marrow megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs). Abcg4(-/-) MkPs had defective cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein (HDL), increased cell surface expression of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (c-MPL) and enhanced proliferation. These consequences of ABCG4 deficiency seemed to reflect disruption of negative feedback regulation of c-MPL signaling by the E3 ligase c-CBL and the cholesterol-sensing LYN kinase. HDL infusion reduced platelet counts in Ldlr(-/-) mice and in a mouse model of myeloproliferative neoplasm in an ABCG4-dependent fashion. HDL infusions may offer a new approach to reducing atherothrombotic events associated with increased platelet production.",

Smad7 dampened both pathways to attenuate inflammation, growth inhibition and apoptosis. Additionally, Smad7 promoted oral epithelial migration to close the wound. Further analyses revealed that TGF-β signaling Smads and their co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) transcriptionally repressed Rac1, and that Smad7 abrogated this repression. Knocking down Rac1 expression in mouse keratinocytes abrogated Smad7-induced migration. Topical application of Smad7 protein conjugated with a cell-permeable Tat tag to oral mucosa showed prophylactic and therapeutic effects on radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice. Thus, we have identified new molecular mechanisms involved in oral mucositis pathogenesis, and our data suggest an alternative therapeutic strategy to block multiple pathological processes in this condition.",

We identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) to be highly enriched in the bone marrow serum of mice bearing deletion of Bak and Bax in TIE2-expressing cells in Tie2Cre; Bak1(-/-); Bax(flox/-) mice. These mice showed radioprotection of the HSC pool and 100% survival after a lethal dose of total-body irradiation (TBI). Bone marrow HSCs from wild-type mice expressed functional EGF receptor (EGFR), and systemic administration of EGF promoted the recovery of the HSC pool in vivo and improved the survival of mice after TBI. Conversely, administration of erlotinib, an EGFR antagonist, decreased both HSC regeneration and the survival of mice after TBI. Mice with EGFR deficiency in VAV-expressing hematopoietic cells also had delayed recovery of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells after TBI. Mechanistically, EGF reduced radiation-induced apoptosis of HSCs and mediated this effect through repression of the proapoptotic protein PUMA. Our findings show that EGFR signaling regulates HSC regeneration after myelosuppressive injury.",

However, many patients have residual cancer after chemotherapy, which correlates with a higher risk of metastatic recurrence and poorer outcome than those who achieve a pCR. We hypothesized that molecular profiling of tumors after NAC would identify genes associated with drug resistance. Digital transcript counting was used to profile surgically resected breast cancers after NAC. Low concentrations of dual specificity protein phosphatase 4 (DUSP4), an ERK phosphatase, correlated with high post-NAC tumor cell proliferation and with basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) status. BLBC had higher DUSP4 promoter methylation and gene expression patterns of Ras-ERK pathway activation relative to other breast cancer subtypes. DUSP4 overexpression increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas DUSP4 depletion dampened the response to chemotherapy. Reduced DUSP4 expression in primary tumors after NAC was associated with treatment-refractory high Ki-67 scores and shorter recurrence-free survival. Finally, inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) synergized with docetaxel treatment in BLBC xenografts. Thus, DUSP4 downregulation activates the Ras-ERK pathway in BLBC, resulting in an attenuated response to anti-cancer chemotherapy.",

Thus far, a mechanistic role for steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs) in the progression of endometriosis has not been elucidated. An SRC-1-null mouse model reveals that the mouse SRC-1 gene has an essential role in endometriosis progression. Notably, a previously unidentified 70-kDa SRC-1 proteolytic isoform is highly elevated both in the endometriotic tissue of mice with surgically induced endometriosis and in endometriotic stromal cells biopsied from patients with endometriosis compared to normal endometrium. Tnf⁻/⁻ and Mmp9⁻/⁻ mice with surgically induced endometriosis showed that activation of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α)-induced matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) activity mediates formation of the 70-kDa SRC-1 C-terminal isoform in endometriotic mouse tissue. In contrast to full-length SRC-1, the endometriotic 70-kDa SRC-1 C-terminal fragment prevents TNF-α-mediated apoptosis in human endometrial epithelial cells and causes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the invasion of human endometrial cells that are hallmarks of progressive endometriosis. Collectively, the newly identified TNF-α-MMP9-SRC-1 isoform functional axis promotes pathogenic progression of endometriosis.",

AKT phosporylates FOXO3a, relocating it from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, an effect that is reversed by PI3K and AKT inhibitors. Simultaneous hyperactivation of the Wnt–β-catenin pathway and inhibition of PI3K-AKT signaling promote nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and FOXO3a, respectively, promoting cell scattering and metastasis by regulating a defined set of target genes. Indeed, the anti-tumoral AKT inhibitor API-2 promotes nuclear FOXO3a accumulation and metastasis of cells with high nuclear β-catenin content. Nuclear β-catenin confers resistance to the FOXO3a-mediated apoptosis induced by PI3K and AKT inhibitors in patient-derived primary cultures and in corresponding xenograft tumors in mice. This resistance is reversed by XAV-939, an inhibitor of Wnt–β-catenin signaling. In the presence of high nuclear β-catenin content, activation of FOXO3a by PI3K or AKT inhibitors makes it behave as a metastasis inductor rather than a proapoptotic tumor suppressor. We show that it is possible to evaluate the β-catenin status of patients' carcinomas and the response of patient-derived cells to target-directed drugs that accumulate FOXO3a in the nucleus before deciding on a course of treatment. We propose that this evaluation could be essential to the provision of a safer and more effective personalized treatment.",

The mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced enteric neuron death are unknown. Here using in vivo models of experimental colitis we report that inflammation causes enteric neuron death by activating a neuronal signaling complex composed of P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs), pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels, the Asc adaptor protein and caspases. Inhibition of P2X7R, Panx1, Asc or caspase activity prevented inflammation-induced neuron cell death. Preservation of enteric neurons by inhibiting Panx1 in vivo prevented the onset of inflammation-induced colonic motor dysfunction. Panx1 expression was reduced in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis. We conclude that activation of neuronal Panx1 underlies neuron death and the subsequent development of abnormal gut motility in IBD. Targeting Panx1 represents a new neuroprotective strategy to ameliorate the progression of IBD-associated dysmotility.",

We previously showed that calorie restriction ameliorated Huntington's disease pathogenesis and slowed disease progression in mice that model Huntington's disease (Huntington's disease mice). We now report that overexpression of sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a mediator of the beneficial metabolic effects of calorie restriction, protects neurons against mutant HTT toxicity, whereas reduction of Sirt1 exacerbates mutant HTT toxicity. Overexpression of Sirt1 improves motor function, reduces brain atrophy and attenuates mutant-HTT-mediated metabolic abnormalities in Huntington's disease mice. Further mechanistic studies suggested that Sirt1 prevents the mutant-HTT-induced decline in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations and the signaling of its receptor, TrkB, and restores dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa (DARPP32) concentrations in the striatum. Sirt1 deacetylase activity is required for Sirt1-mediated neuroprotection in Huntington's disease cell models. Notably, we show that mutant HTT interacts with Sirt1 and inhibits Sirt1 deacetylase activity, which results in hyperacetylation of Sirt1 substrates such as forkhead box O3A (Foxo3a), thereby inhibiting its pro-survival function. Overexpression of Sirt1 counteracts the mutant-HTT-induced deacetylase deficit, enhances the deacetylation of Foxo3a and facilitates cell survival. These findings show a neuroprotective role for Sirt1 in mammalian Huntington's disease models and open new avenues for the development of neuroprotective strategies in Huntington's disease.",

Constitutive activation of the Hedgehog signaling molecule Smoothened (Smo) promoted the clonogenicity of human SCLC in vitro and the initiation and progression of mouse SCLC in vivo. Reciprocally, deletion of Smo in Rb1 and Trp53-mutant lung epithelial cells strongly suppressed SCLC initiation and progression in mice. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of Hedgehog signaling inhibited the growth of mouse and human SCLC, most notably following chemotherapy. These findings show a crucial cell-intrinsic role for Hedgehog signaling in the development and maintenance of SCLC and identify Hedgehog pathway inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to slow the progression of disease and delay cancer recurrence in individuals with SCLC.",

Recent work in mouse models showed that the loss of p53 accelerated the development of medulloblastoma. The mechanism underlying p53 inactivation in human brain tumors is not completely understood. We show that ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B), an E3 and E4 ubiquitin ligase, physically interacts with p53 and Hdm2 (also known as Mdm2 in mice). UBE4B promotes p53 polyubiquitination and degradation and inhibits p53-dependent transactivation and apoptosis. Notably, silencing UBE4B expression impairs xenotransplanted tumor growth in a p53-dependent manner and overexpression of UBE4B correlates with decreased expression of p53 in these tumors. We also show that UBE4B overexpression is often associated with amplification of its gene in human brain tumors. Our data indicate that amplification and overexpression of UBE4B represent previously undescribed molecular mechanisms of inactivation of p53 in brain tumors.",

We show that cerebral hematoma expansion triggered by intracerebral infusion of autologous blood is greater in diabetic rats and mice compared to nondiabetic controls and that this augmented expansion is ameliorated by plasma kallikrein (PK) inhibition or deficiency. Intracerebral injection of purified PK augmented hematoma expansion in both diabetic and acutely hyperglycemic rats, whereas injection of bradykinin, plasmin or tissue plasminogen activator did not elicit such a response. This response, which occurs rapidly, was prevented by co-injection of the glycoprotein VI agonist convulxin and was mimicked by glycoprotein VI inhibition or deficiency, implicating an effect of PK on inhibiting platelet aggregation. We show that PK inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation by binding collagen, a response enhanced by elevated glucose concentrations. The effect of hyperglycemia on hematoma expansion and PK-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation could be mimicked by infusing mannitol. These findings suggest that hyperglycemia augments cerebral hematoma expansion by PK-mediated osmotic-sensitive inhibition of hemostasis.",

However, IL-6-induced STAT3 activation is normally transient. Here we identify a key mechanism for persistent STAT3 activation in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. We show that expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1PR1), a G protein-coupled receptor for the lysophospholipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), is elevated in STAT3-positive tumors. STAT3 is a transcription factor for the S1pr1 gene. Reciprocally, enhanced S1pr1 expression activates STAT3 and upregulates Il6 gene expression, thereby accelerating tumor growth and metastasis in a STAT3-dependent manner. Silencing S1pr1 in tumor cells or immune cells inhibits tumor STAT3 activity, tumor growth and metastasis. S1P-S1PR1-induced STAT3 activation is persistent, in contrast to transient STAT3 activation by IL-6. S1PR1 activates STAT3 in part by upregulating JAK2 tyrosine kinase activity. We show that STAT3-induced S1PR1 expression, as well as the S1P-S1PR1 pathway reciprocal regulation of STAT3 activity, is a major positive feedback loop for persistent STAT3 activation in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment and for malignant progression.",

Defects of this degradative system have a role in various diseases, but little is known about autophagy in muscular dystrophies. We have previously found that muscular dystrophies linked to collagen VI deficiency show dysfunctional mitochondria and spontaneous apoptosis, leading to myofiber degeneration. Here we demonstrate that this persistence of abnormal organelles and apoptosis are caused by defective autophagy. Skeletal muscles of collagen VI-knockout (Col6a1(-/-)) mice had impaired autophagic flux, which matched the lower induction of beclin-1 and BCL-2/adenovirus E1B-interacting protein-3 (Bnip3) and the lack of autophagosomes after starvation. Forced activation of autophagy by genetic, dietary and pharmacological approaches restored myofiber survival and ameliorated the dystrophic phenotype of Col6a1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, muscle biopsies from subjects with Bethlem myopathy or Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy had reduced protein amounts of beclin-1 and Bnip3. These findings indicate that defective activation of the autophagic machinery is pathogenic in some congenital muscular dystrophies.",

MSI2 is overexpressed in human myeloid leukemia cell lines, and its depletion leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Expression levels in human myeloid leukemia directly correlate with decreased survival in patients with the disease, thereby defining MSI2 expression as a new prognostic marker and as a new target for therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).",

Here we show that p85alphaalpha interacts with X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), a transcriptional mediator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), in an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent manner. Cell lines with knockout or knockdown of p85alphaalpha show marked alterations in the UPR, including reduced ER stress-dependent accumulation of nuclear XBP-1, decreased induction of UPR target genes and increased rates of apoptosis. This is associated with a decreased activation of inositol-requiring protein-1alpha (IRE1alpha) and activating transcription factor-6alphaalpha (ATF6alpha). Mice with deletion of p85alpha in liver (L-Pik3r1(-/-)) show a similar attenuated UPR after tunicamycin administration, leading to an increased inflammatory response. Thus, p85alphaalpha forms a previously unrecognized link between the PI3K pathway, which is central to insulin action, and the regulation of the cellular response to ER stress, a state that when unresolved leads to insulin resistance.",

        "TEXT": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent data suggest that tumor-associated inflammatory cells may modify lung tumor growth and invasiveness. To determine the role of neutrophil elastase (encoded by Elane) on tumor progression, we used the loxP-Stop-loxP K-ras(G12D) (LSL-K-ras) model of mouse lung adenocarcinoma to generate LSL-K-ras-Elane(-/-) mice. Tumor burden was markedly reduced in LSL-K-ras-Elane(-/-) mice at all time points after induction of mutant K-ras expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that whereas all LSL-K-ras-Elane(+/+) mice died, none of the mice lacking neutrophil elastase died. Neutrophil elastase directly induced tumor cell proliferation in both human and mouse lung adenocarcinomas by gaining access to an endosomal compartment within tumor cells, where it degraded insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Immunoprecipitation studies showed that, as neutrophil elastase degraded IRS-1, there was increased interaction between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and the potent mitogen platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), thereby skewing the PI3K axis toward tumor cell proliferation. The inverse relationship identified between neutrophil elastase and IRS-1 in LSL-K-ras mice was also identified in human lung adenocarcinomas, thus translating these findings to human disease. This study identifies IRS-1 as a key regulator of PI3K within malignant cells. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first description of a secreted proteinase gaining access to the inside of a cell and altering intracellular signaling.",

By contrast, the study of chromosomal deletions has been hampered by the large number of genes deleted and the complexity of their analysis. We report the generation of a mouse model for human 5q- syndrome using large-scale chromosomal engineering. Haploinsufficiency of the Cd74-Nid67 interval (containing Rps14, encoding the ribosomal protein S14) caused macrocytic anemia, prominent erythroid dysplasia and monolobulated megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. These effects were associated with defective bone marrow progenitor development, the appearance of bone marrow cells expressing high amounts of the tumor suppressor p53 and increased bone marrow cell apoptosis. Notably, intercrossing with p53-deficient mice completely rescued the progenitor cell defect, restoring common myeloid progenitor and megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor, granulocyte-monocyte progenitor and hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow populations. This mouse model suggests that a p53-dependent mechanism underlies the pathophysiology of the 5q- syndrome.",

Here we show that dying tumor cells release ATP, which then acts on P2X(7) purinergic receptors from DCs and triggers the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing-3 protein (NLRP3)-dependent caspase-1 activation complex ('inflammasome'), allowing for the secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). The priming of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells by dying tumor cells fails in the absence of a functional IL-1 receptor 1 and in Nlpr3-deficient (Nlrp3(-/-)) or caspase-1-deficient (Casp-1(-/-)) mice unless exogenous IL-1beta is provided. Accordingly, anticancer chemotherapy turned out to be inefficient against tumors established in purinergic receptor P2rx7(-/-) or Nlrp3(-/-) or Casp1(-/-) hosts. Anthracycline-treated individuals with breast cancer carrying a loss-of-function allele of P2RX7 developed metastatic disease more rapidly than individuals bearing the normal allele. These results indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome links the innate and adaptive immune responses against dying tumor cells.",

In particular, expression of integrin alpha(v)beta(3) is associated with progression of a variety of human tumors. Here we reveal a previously undescribed adhesion-independent role for integrin alpha(v)beta(3) in pancreatic cancer and other carcinomas. Specifically, alpha(v)beta(3) expressed in carcinoma cells enhanced anchorage-independent tumor growth in vitro and increased lymph node metastases in vivo. These effects required recruitment of c-Src to the beta(3) integrin cytoplasmic tail, leading to c-Src activation, Crk-associated substrate (CAS) phosphorylation and tumor cell survival that, unexpectedly, was independent of cell adhesion or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. Pharmacological blockade of c-Src kinase activity or decreased expression of endogenous alpha(v)beta(3) integrin or c-Src not only inhibited anchorage-independent growth but also suppressed metastasis in vivo, yet these manipulations did not affect tumor cell migration or invasion. These data define an unexpected role for an integrin as a mediator of anchorage independence, suggesting that an alpha(v)beta(3)-c-Src signaling module may account for the aggressive behavior of integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing tumors in humans.",

Here we describe robust long-term methodology for small and large intestinal culture, incorporating an air-liquid interface and underlying stromal elements. These cultures showed prolonged intestinal epithelial expansion as sphere-like organoids with proliferation and multilineage differentiation. The Wnt growth factor family positively regulates proliferation of the intestinal epithelium in vivo. Accordingly, culture growth was inhibited by the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) and markedly stimulated by a fusion protein between the Wnt agonist R-spondin-1 and immunoglobulin Fc (RSpo1-Fc). Furthermore, treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine and neurogenin-3 overexpression induced goblet cell and enteroendocrine cell differentiation, respectively, consistent with endogenous Notch signaling and lineage plasticity. Epithelial cells derived from both leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor-5-positive (Lgr5(+)) and B lymphoma moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region homolog-1-positive (Bmi1(+)) lineages, representing putative intestinal stem cell (ISC) populations, were present in vitro and were expanded by treatment with RSpo1-Fc; this increased number of Lgr5(+) cells upon RSpo1-Fc treatment was subsequently confirmed in vivo. Our results indicate successful long-term intestinal culture within a microenvironment accurately recapitulating the Wnt- and Notch-dependent ISC niche.",

Here we present in vivo evidence that low (nanomolar) concentrations of RGD-mimetic alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(v)beta(5) inhibitors can paradoxically stimulate tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. We show that low concentrations of these inhibitors promote VEGF-mediated angiogenesis by altering alpha(v)beta(3) integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 trafficking, thereby promoting endothelial cell migration to VEGF. The proangiogenic effects of low concentrations of RGD-mimetic integrin inhibitors could compromise their efficacy as anticancer agents and have major implications for the use of RGD-mimetic compounds in humans.",

How mitochondrial biogenesis is integrated with osteoclast differentiation is unknown. We found that the transcription of Ppargc1b, which encodes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1beta (PGC-1beta), was induced during osteoclast differentiation by cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) as a result of reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Ppargc1b in vitro inhibited osteoclast differentiation and mitochondria biogenesis, whereas deletion of the Ppargc1b gene in mice resulted in increased bone mass due to impaired osteoclast function. We also observed defects in PGC-1beta-deficient osteoblasts. Owing to the heightened iron demand in osteoclast development, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression was induced post-transcriptionally via iron regulatory protein 2. TfR1-mediated iron uptake promoted osteoclast differentiation and bone-resorbing activity, associated with the induction of mitochondrial respiration, production of reactive oxygen species and accelerated Ppargc1b transcription. Iron chelation inhibited osteoclastic bone resorption and protected against bone loss following estrogen deficiency resulting from ovariectomy. These data establish mitochondrial biogenesis orchestrated by PGC-1beta, coupled with iron uptake through TfR1 and iron supply to mitochondrial respiratory proteins, as a fundamental pathway linked to osteoclast activation and bone metabolism.",

We show here that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine present in the cystic fluid of humans with ADPKD, disrupts the localization of polycystin-2 to the plasma membrane and primary cilia through a scaffold protein, FIP2, which is induced by TNF-alpha. Treatment of mouse embryonic kidney organ cultures with TNF-alpha resulted in formation of cysts, and this effect was exacerbated in the Pkd2(+/-) kidneys. TNF-alpha also stimulated cyst formation in vivo in Pkd2(+/-) mice. In contrast, treatment of Pkd2(+/-) mice with the TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept prevented cyst formation. These data reveal a pathway connecting TNF-alpha signaling, polycystins and cystogenesis, the activation of which may reduce functional polycystin-2 below a critical threshold, precipitating the ADPKD cellular phenotype.",

Although the protein downstream of tyrosine kinases-1 (Dok1) is known to function as a multisite adapter molecule in insulin signaling, its role in energy homeostasis has remained unclear. Here we show that Dok1 regulates adiposity. Expression of Dok1 in white adipose tissue was markedly increased in mice fed a high-fat diet, whereas adipocytes lacking this adapter were smaller and showed a reduced hypertrophic response to this dietary manipulation. Dok1-deficient mice were leaner and showed improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity compared with wild-type mice. Embryonic fibroblasts from Dok1-deficient mice were impaired in adipogenic differentiation, and this defect was accompanied by an increased activity of the protein kinase ERK and a consequent increase in the phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma on Ser112. Mutation of this negative regulatory site for the transactivation activity of PPAR-gamma blocked development of the lean phenotype caused by Dok1 ablation. These results indicate that Dok1 promotes adipocyte hypertrophy by counteracting the inhibitory effect of ERK on PPAR-gamma and may thus confer predisposition to diet-induced obesity.",

Here we report a previously undescribed mechanism by which the tumor endothelium prevents T cell homing and hinders tumor immunotherapy. Transcriptional profiling of microdissected tumor endothelial cells from human ovarian cancers revealed genes associated with the absence or presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Overexpression of the endothelin B receptor (ET(B)R) was associated with the absence of TILs and short patient survival time. The ET(B)R inhibitor BQ-788 increased T cell adhesion to human endothelium in vitro, an effect countered by intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) blockade or treatment with NO donors. In mice, ET(B)R neutralization by BQ-788 increased T cell homing to tumors; this homing required ICAM-1 and enabled tumor response to otherwise ineffective immunotherapy in vivo without changes in systemic antitumor immune response. These findings highlight a molecular mechanism with the potential to be pharmacologically manipulated to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy in humans.",

The isolated TSPCs could regenerate tendon-like tissues after extended expansion in vitro and transplantation in vivo. Moreover, we show that TSPCs reside within a unique niche predominantly comprised of an extracellular matrix, and we identify biglycan (Bgn) and fibromodulin (Fmod) as two critical components that organize this niche.

To assess the role of vascular immaturity in germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH), we evaluated germinal matrix angiogenesis in human fetuses and premature infants, as well as in premature rabbit pups, and noted active vessel remodeling in all three. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin-2 and endothelial cell proliferation were present at consistently higher levels in the germinal matrix relative to the white matter anlagen and cortical mantle. On that basis, we asked whether prenatal treatment with either of two angiogenic inhibitors, the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, or the VEGFR2 inhibitor ZD6474, could suppress the incidence of GMH in premature rabbit pups. Celecoxib treatment decreased angiopoietin-2 and VEGF levels as well as germinal matrix endothelial proliferation. Furthermore, treatment with celecoxib or ZD6474 substantially decreased the incidence of GMH. Thus, by suppressing germinal matrix angiogenesis, prenatal celecoxib or ZD6474 treatment may be able to reduce both the incidence and severity of GMH in susceptible premature infants.",

We found that CB(1) receptor expression by neurons, but not T cells, was required for cannabinoid-mediated EAE suppression. In contrast, CB(2) receptor expression by encephalitogenic T cells was critical for controlling inflammation associated with EAE. CB(2)-deficient T cells in the CNS during EAE exhibited reduced levels of apoptosis, a higher rate of proliferation and increased production of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in severe clinical disease.

Here we show that anthracyclins induce the rapid, preapoptotic translocation of calreticulin (CRT) to the cell surface. Blockade or knockdown of CRT suppressed the phagocytosis of anthracyclin-treated tumor cells by dendritic cells and abolished their immunogenicity in mice. The anthracyclin-induced CRT translocation was mimicked by inhibition of the protein phosphatase 1/GADD34 complex. Administration of recombinant CRT or inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1/GADD34 restored the immunogenicity of cell death elicited by etoposide and mitomycin C, and enhanced their antitumor effects in vivo. These data identify CRT as a key feature determining anticancer immune responses and delineate a possible strategy for immunogenic chemotherapy.",

Osteoclasts are multinucleated, giant cells of hematopoietic origin formed by the fusion of mononuclear pre-osteoclasts derived from myeloid cells. Fusion-mediated giant cell formation is critical for osteoclast maturation; without it, bone resorption is inefficient. To understand how osteoclasts differ from other myeloid lineage cells, we previously compared global mRNA expression patterns in these cells and identified genes of unknown function predominantly expressed in osteoclasts, one of which is the d2 isoform of vacuolar (H(+)) ATPase (v-ATPase) V(0) domain (Atp6v0d2). Here we show that inactivation of Atp6v0d2 in mice results in markedly increased bone mass due to defective osteoclasts and enhanced bone formation. Atp6v0d2 deficiency did not affect differentiation or the v-ATPase activity of osteoclasts. Rather, Atp6v0d2 was required for efficient pre-osteoclast fusion. Increased bone formation was probably due to osteoblast-extrinsic factors, as Atp6v02 was not expressed in osteoblasts and their differentiation ex vivo was not altered in the absence of Atp6v02. Our results identify Atp6v0d2 as a regulator of osteoclast fusion and bone formation, and provide genetic data showing that it is possible to simultaneously inhibit osteoclast maturation and stimulate bone formation by therapeutically targeting the function of a single gene.",

We initially documented the importance of this transcription factor in the bone marrow of individuals with severe congenital neutropenia (CN) with a 'differentiation block' at the promyelocytic stage of myelopoiesis. LEF-1 expression was greatly reduced or even absent in CN arrested promyelocytes, resulting in defective expression of the LEF-1 target genes CCND1, MYC and BIRC5, encoding cyclin D1 (ref. 2), c-Myc and survivin, respectively. In contrast, healthy individuals showed highest LEF-1 expression in promyelocytes. Reconstitution of LEF-1 in early hematopoietic progenitors of two individuals with CN corrected the defective myelopoiesis and resulted in the differentiation of these progenitors into mature granulocytes. Repression of endogenous LEF-1 by specific short hairpin RNA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of CD34(+) progenitors from healthy individuals and of cells from two myeloid lines (HL-60 and K562). C/EBPalpha, a key transcription factor in granulopoiesis, was directly regulated by LEF-1. These observations indicate that LEF-1 is an instructive factor regulating neutrophilic granulopoiesis whose absence plays a critical role in the defective maturation program of myeloid progenitors in individuals with CN.",

Although VSMC apoptosis promotes vessel remodeling, coagulation and inflammation, its precise contribution to these diseases is unknown, given that apoptosis frequently accompanies vessel injury or alterations to flow. To study the direct consequences of VSMC apoptosis, we generated transgenic mice expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor (hDTR, encoded by HBEGF) from a minimal Tagln (also known as SM22alpha) promoter. Despite apoptosis inducing loss of 50-70% of VSMCs, normal arteries showed no inflammation, reactive proliferation, thrombosis, remodeling or aneurysm formation. In contrast, VSMC apoptosis in atherosclerotic plaques of SM22alpha-hDTR Apoe-/- mice induced marked thinning of fibrous cap, loss of collagen and matrix, accumulation of cell debris and intense intimal inflammation. We conclude that VSMC apoptosis is 'silent' in normal arteries, which have a large capacity to withstand cell loss. In contrast, VSMC apoptosis alone is sufficient to induce features of plaque vulnerability in atherosclerosis. SM22alpha-hDTR Apoe-/- mice may represent an important new model to test agents proposed to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques.",

Its effects in pregnant rats are amplified by coadministration of sFlt1, leading to severe preeclampsia including the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome and restriction of fetal growth. sEng impairs binding of TGF-beta1 to its receptors and downstream signaling including effects on activation of eNOS and vasodilation, suggesting that sEng leads to dysregulated TGF-beta signaling in the vasculature.

In Atm(-/-) mice, elevation of ROS levels induces HSC-specific phosphorylation of p38 MAPK accompanied by a defect in the maintenance of HSC quiescence. Inhibition of p38 MAPK rescued ROS-induced defects in HSC repopulating capacity and in the maintenance of HSC quiescence, indicating that the ROS-p38 MAPK pathway contributes to exhaustion of the stem cell population. Furthermore, prolonged treatment with an antioxidant or an inhibitor of p38 MAPK extended the lifespan of HSCs from wild-type mice in serial transplantation experiments. These data show that inactivation of p38 MAPK protects HSCs against loss of self-renewal capacity. Our characterization of molecular mechanisms that limit HSC lifespan may lead to beneficial therapies for human disease.",

Generating effective CD8+ T cell-mediated responses to tumors is often impeded by T-cell tolerance to relevant tumor antigens, as most of these antigens are also expressed in normal tissues. We examined whether such tolerant T cells could be rescued and functionally restored for use in therapy of established tumors. We used a transgenic T-cell receptor (TCR) mouse model in which peripheral CD8+ T cells specific for a candidate tumor antigen also expressed in liver are tolerant, failing to proliferate or secrete interleukin (IL)-2 in response to antigen. Molecular and cellular analysis showed that these tolerant T cells expressed the IL-15 receptor alpha chain, and could be induced to proliferate in vitro in response to exogenous IL-15. Such proliferation abrogated tolerance and the rescued cells became effective in treating leukemia. Therefore, high-affinity CD8+ T cells are not necessarily deleted by encounter with self-antigen in the periphery, and can potentially be rescued and expanded for use in tumor immunotherapy.",

We show that JNK programs a gene expression pattern in different cell types that cooperatively enhances the degradation of the extracellular matrix while suppressing biosynthetic enzymes of the extracellular matrix. Selective inhibition of JNK in vivo not only prevented the development of AAA but also caused regression of established AAA in two mouse models. Thus, JNK promotes abnormal extracellular matrix metabolism in the tissue of AAA and may represent a therapeutic target.",

Unraveling the molecular basis of lymphangiogenesis has been hampered by the lack of a small animal model that can be genetically manipulated. Here, we show that Xenopus tadpoles develop lymph vessels from lymphangioblasts or, through transdifferentiation, from venous endothelial cells. Lymphangiography showed that these lymph vessels drain lymph, through the lymph heart, to the venous circulation. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of the lymphangiogenic factor Prox1 caused lymph vessel defects and lymphedema by impairing lymphatic commitment. Knockdown of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) also induced lymph vessel defects and lymphedema, but primarily by affecting migration of lymphatic endothelial cells. Knockdown of VEGF-C also resulted in aberrant blood vessel formation in tadpoles. This tadpole model offers opportunities for the discovery of new regulators of lymphangiogenesis.",

Here, we show that transcriptional profiling of human brain endothelial cells (BECs) defines a subset of genes whose expression is age-independent but is considerably altered in Alzheimer disease, including the homeobox gene MEOX2 (also known as GAX), a regulator of vascular differentiation, whose expression is low in Alzheimer disease. By using viral-mediated MEOX2 gene silencing and transfer, we show that restoring expression of the protein it encodes, GAX, in BECs from individuals with Alzheimer disease stimulates angiogenesis, transcriptionally suppresses AFX1 forkhead transcription factor-mediated apoptosis and increases the levels of a major amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) clearance receptor, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP), at the blood-brain barrier. In mice, deletion of Meox2 (also known as Gax) results in reductions in brain capillary density and resting cerebral blood flow, loss of the angiogenic response to hypoxia in the brain and an impaired Abeta efflux from brain caused by reduced LRP levels. The link of MEOX2 to neurovascular dysfunction in Alzheimer disease provides new mechanistic and therapeutic insights into this illness.",

Although deletion of icl1 or icl2, the genes that encode ICL1 and ICL2, respectively, had little effect on bacterial growth in macrophages and mice, deletion of both genes resulted in complete impairment of intracellular replication and rapid elimination from the lungs. The feasibility of targeting ICL1 and ICL2 for chemical inhibition was shown using a dual-specific ICL inhibitor, which blocked growth of M. tuberculosis on fatty acids and in macrophages. The absence of ICL orthologs in mammals should facilitate the development of glyoxylate cycle inhibitors as new drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis.",

RAB25 mRNA levels were selectively increased in stage III and IV serous epithelial ovarian cancers compared to other genes within the amplified region, implicating RAB25 as a driving event in the development of the amplicon. Increased DNA copy number or RNA level of RAB25 was associated with markedly decreased disease-free survival or overall survival in ovarian and breast cancers, respectively. Forced expression of RAB25 markedly increased anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell proliferation, prevented apoptosis and anoikis, including that induced by chemotherapy, and increased aggressiveness of cancer cells in vivo. The inhibition of apoptosis was associated with a decrease in expression of the proapoptotic molecules, BAK and BAX, and activation of the antiapoptotic phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and AKT pathway, providing potential mechanisms for the effects of RAB25 on tumor aggressiveness. Overall, these studies implicate RAB25, and thus the RAB family of small G proteins, in aggressiveness of epithelial cancers.",

The acquisition of glycolipid antigens by CD1d occurs, in part, in endosomes through the function of resident lipid transfer proteins, namely saposins. Here we show that microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and is essential for lipidation of apolipoprotein B, associates with CD1d in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes from animals in which Mttp (the gene encoding MTP) has been conditionally deleted, and IECs in which Mttp gene products have been silenced, are unable to activate invariant NKT cells. Conditional deletion of the Mttp gene in hepatocytes is associated with a redistribution of CD1d expression, and Mttp-deleted mice are resistant to immunopathologies associated with invariant NKT cell-mediated hepatitis and colitis. These studies indicate that the CD1d-regulating function of MTP in the endoplasmic reticulum is complementary to that of the saposins in endosomes in vivo.",

Despite the importance of ESCs in developmental biology and their potential impact on tissue replacement therapy, the molecular mechanism underlying ESC self-renewal is poorly understood. Here we show that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is sufficient to maintain self-renewal of both HESCs and MESCs. Although Stat-3 signaling is involved in MESC self-renewal, stimulation of this pathway does not support self-renewal of HESCs. Instead we find that Wnt pathway activation by 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), maintains the undifferentiated phenotype in both types of ESCs and sustains expression of the pluripotent state-specific transcription factors Oct-3/4, Rex-1 and Nanog. Wnt signaling is endogenously activated in undifferentiated MESCs and is downregulated upon differentiation. In addition, BIO-mediated Wnt activation is functionally reversible, as withdrawal of the compound leads to normal multidifferentiation programs in both HESCs and MESCs. These results suggest that the use of GSK-3-specific inhibitors such as BIO may have practical applications in regenerative medicine.",

The predominant subtype, CMT-1A, accounts for more than 50% of all cases and is associated with an interstitial chromosomal duplication of 17p12 (refs. 2,3). We have generated a model of CMT-1A by introducing extra copies of the responsible disease gene, Pmp22 (encoding the peripheral myelin protein of 22 kDa), into transgenic rats. Here, we used this model to test whether progesterone, a regulator of the myelin genes Pmp22 and myelin protein zero (Mpz) in cultured Schwann cells, can modulate the progressive neuropathy caused by moderate overexpression of Pmp22. Male transgenic rats (n = 84) were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: progesterone, progesterone antagonist (onapristone) and placebo control. Daily administration of progesterone elevated the steady-state levels of Pmp22 and Mpz mRNA in the sciatic nerve, resulting in enhanced Schwann cell pathology and a more progressive clinical neuropathy. In contrast, administration of the selective progesterone receptor antagonist reduced overexpression of Pmp22 and improved the CMT phenotype, without obvious side effects, in wild-type or transgenic rats. Taken together, these data provide proof of principle that the progesterone receptor of myelin-forming Schwann cells is a promising pharmacological target for therapy of CMT-1A.",

We show that the abortion of thrombomodulin-deficient embryos is caused by tissue factor-initiated activation of the blood coagulation cascade at the feto-maternal interface. Activated coagulation factors induce cell death and growth inhibition of placental trophoblast cells by two distinct mechanisms. The death of giant trophoblast cells is caused by conversion of the thrombin substrate fibrinogen to fibrin and subsequent formation of fibrin degradation products. In contrast, the growth arrest of trophoblast cells is not mediated by fibrin, but is a likely result of engagement of protease-activated receptors (PAR)-2 and PAR-4 by coagulation factors. These findings show a new function for the thrombomodulin-protein C system in controlling the growth and survival of trophoblast cells in the placenta. This function is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy.",

We used the angiogenic defective, tumor resistant Id-mutant mice to show that transplantation of wild-type BM or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mobilized stem cells restore tumor angiogenesis and growth. We detected donor-derived CEPs throughout the neovessels of tumors and Matrigel-plugs in an Id1+/-Id3-/- host, which were associated with VEGF-receptor-1-positive (VEGFR1+) myeloid cells. The angiogenic defect in Id-mutant mice was due to impaired VEGF-driven mobilization of VEGFR2+ CEPs and impaired proliferation and incorporation of VEGFR1+ cells. Although targeting of either VEGFR1 or VEGFR2 alone partially blocks the growth of tumors, inhibition of both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 was necessary to completely ablate tumor growth. These data demonstrate that recruitment of VEGF-responsive BM-derived precursors is necessary and sufficient for tumor angiogenesis and suggest new clinical strategies to block tumor growth.",

Here we show that glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1) interacts with FANCC, and that overexpression of both proteins in a myeloid progenitor cell line prevents apoptosis following factor deprivation. FANCC increases GSTP1 activity after the induction of apoptosis. GSTP1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the detoxification of xenobiotics and by-products of oxidative stress, and it is frequently upregulated in neoplastic cells. Although FANCC lacks homology with conventional disulfide reductases, it functions by preventing the formation of inactivating disulfide bonds within GSTP1 during apoptosis. The prevention of protein oxidation by FANCC reveals a novel mechanism of enzyme regulation during apoptosis and has implications for the treatment of degenerative diseases with thiol reducing agents.",

We have found that inhibition of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, either by mutation or by the drug STI571, can stimulate its nuclear entry. By combining STI571 with leptomycin B (LMB) to block nuclear export, we trapped BCR-ABL in the nucleus and the nuclear BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activates apoptosis. As a result, the combined treatment with STI571 and LMB causes the irreversible and complete killing of BCR-ABL transformed cells, whereas the effect of either drug alone is fully reversible. The combined treatment with STI571 and LMB also preferentially eliminates mouse bone marrow cells that express BCR-ABL.

TNF-alpha(-/-) mice were resistant to development of benign and malignant skin tumors, whether induced by initiation with DMBA and promotion with TPA or by repeated dosing with DMBA. TNF-alpha(-/-) mice developed 5-10% the number of tumors developed by wild-type mice during initiation/promotion and 25% of those in wild-type mice after repeated carcinogen treatment. TNF-alpha could influence tumor and stromal cells during tumor development. The early stages of TPA promotion are characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and inflammation. These were diminished in TNF-alpha(-/-) mice. TNF-alpha was extensively induced in the epidermis, but not the dermis, in TPA-treated wild-type skin, indicating that dermal inflammation is controlled by keratinocyte TNF-alpha production. Deletion of a TNF-alpha inducible chemokine also conferred some resistance to skin tumor development. TNF-alpha has little influence on later stages of carcinogenesis, as tumors in wild-type and TNF-alpha(-/-) mice had similar rates of malignant progression. These data provide evidence that a pro-inflammatory cytokine is required for de novo carcinogenesis and that TNF-alpha is important to the early stages of tumor promotion.

        "TEXT": "Liver cirrhosis is the irreversible end result of fibrous scarring and hepatocellular regeneration, characterized by diffuse disorganization of the normal hepatic structure of regenerative nodules and fibrotic tissue. It is associated with prominent morbidity and mortality, and is induced by many factors, including chronic hepatitis virus infections, alcohol drinking and drug abuse. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), originally identified and cloned as a potent mitogen for hepatocytes, shows mitogenic, motogenic and morphogenic activities for a wide variety of cells. Moreover, HGF plays an essential part in the development and regeneration of the liver, and shows anti-apoptotic activity in hepatocytes. In a rat model of lethal liver cirrhosis produced by dimethylnitrosamine administrations, repeated transfections of the human HGF gene into skeletal muscles induced a high plasma level of human as well as enodogenous rat HGF, and tyrosine phosphorylation of the c-Met/HGF receptor. Transduction with the HGF gene also suppressed the increase of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), which plays an essential part in the progression of liver cirrhosis, inhibited fibrogenesis and hepatocyte apoptosis, and produced the complete resolution of fibrosis in the cirrhotic liver, thereby improving the survival rate of rats with this severe illness. Thus, HGF gene therapy may be potentially useful for the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis, which is otherwise fatal and untreatable by conventional therapy.",

Recently, studies in urokinase (uPA) transgenic mice and in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH)-deficient mice have shown that the liver can be repopulated by genetically engineered hepatocytes harboring a selective advantage over resident hepatocytes. We have reported that transgenic mice expressing human Bcl-2 in their hepatocytes are protected from Fas/CD95-mediated liver apoptosis. We now show that Bcl-2 transplanted hepatocytes selectively repopulate the liver of mice treated with nonlethal doses of the anti-Fas antibody Jo2. FK 506 immunosuppressed mice were transplanted by splenic injection with Bcl-2 hepatocytes. The livers of female recipients were repopulated by male Bcl-2 transgenic hepatocytes, as much as 16%, after 8 to 12 administrations of Jo2. This only occurred after anti-Fas treatment, confirming that resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis constituted the selective advantage of these transplanted hepatocytes. Thus, we have demonstrated a method for increasing genetic reconstitution of the liver through selective repopulation with modified transgenic hepatocytes, which will allow optimization of cell and gene therapy in the liver.",

The mechanism(s) that underlie resistance to androgen ablation therapy remain mostly unknown. We have demonstrated that elevated caveolin protein levels are associated with human prostate cancer progression in pathological specimens. Here we show that suppression of caveolin expression by a stably transfected antisense caveolin-1 cDNA vector converted androgen-insensitive metastatic mouse prostate cancer cells to an androgen-sensitive phenotype. Orthotopically grown tumors and low-density cell cultures derived from antisense caveolin clones had increased apoptosis in the absence of androgenic steroids, whereas similarly grown tumors and cells from vector (control) clones and parental cells were not sensitive to androgens. Studies using a representative antisense caveolin clone showed that selection for androgen resistance in vivo correlated with increased caveolin levels, and that adenovirus-mediated caveolin expression blocked androgen sensitivity. Our results identify a new candidate gene for hormone-resistant prostate cancer in man and indicate that androgen insensitivity can be an inherent property of metastatic prostate cancer.",

This effect was associated with inhibition of CL development and progesterone release. Failure of maturation of the endometrium was also observed. Areas of ischemic necrosis were demonstrated in the corpora lutea (CLs) of treated animals. However, no effect on the preexisting ovarian vasculature was observed.

When transferred from monolayer to three-dimensional culture, a consistent upregulation (up to 15-fold) of p27 protein was observed in a panel of mouse and human carcinoma cell lines. Antisense-oligonucleotide-mediated downregulation of p27 in EMT-6 mammary tumor cell spheroids reduced intercellular adhesion, increased cell proliferation, sensitized tumor cells to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, and restored drug- or radiation-induced cell-cycle perturbations repressed in spheroid culture.

Hair cells can be lost as a consequence of viral or bacterial insult, aging, and damage from intense sound or aminoglycoside antibiotics. The generation of replacement hair cells following damage by sound or drugs has been clearly demonstrated in birds; the chick is the best-studied model for auditory hair cell regeneration. New hair cells arise as progeny from an otherwise nondividing supporting cell population induced to proliferate by the damage. Functional recovery of hearing accompanies this cellular recovery process. The signals and pathways responsible for regenerative proliferation are unknown. Here we show that proliferation is induced in the undamaged receptor epithelium by agents that increase cyclic AMP levels, and that following this stimulation hair cells become labeled with proliferation markers. This remarkable proliferative response is blocked by inhibitors of the cAMP-regulated protein kinase A (PKA). In addition we show that the proliferative response induced by in vitro gentamicin damage is also significantly blocked by PKA inhibitors. These observations are the first to identify a signaling pathway that plays a role in regenerative proliferation in the auditory receptor epithelium.",

We linked the radiation-inducible promoter region of the Egr-1 gene to the gene encoding the radiosensitizing and tumoricidal cytokine, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and used a replication-deficient adenovirus to deliver the Egr-TNF construct to human tumours growing in nude mice. Combined treatment with Ad5.Egr-TNF and 5,000 cGy (rad) resulted in increased intratumoral TNF-alpha production and increased tumour control compared with treatment with Ad5.Egr-TNF alone or with radiation alone. The increase in tumour control was achieved without an increase in normal tissue damage when compared to tissue injury from radiation alone. Control of gene transcription by ionizing radiation in vivo represents a novel method of spatial and temporal regulation of gene-based medical treatments.",

This process is controlled by the rate-limiting enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), an attractive but traditionally intractable drug target. Here we provide genetic and pharmacological evidence that in preclinical models ACC is required to maintain the de novo fatty acid synthesis needed for growth and viability of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. We describe the ability of ND-646-an allosteric inhibitor of the ACC enzymes ACC1 and ACC2 that prevents ACC subunit dimerization-to suppress fatty acid synthesis in vitro and in vivo. Chronic ND-646 treatment of xenograft and genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC inhibited tumor growth. When administered as a single agent or in combination with the standard-of-care drug carboplatin, ND-646 markedly suppressed lung tumor growth in the Kras;Trp53-/- (also known as KRAS p53) and Kras;Stk11-/- (also known as KRAS Lkb1) mouse models of NSCLC. These findings demonstrate that ACC mediates a metabolic liability of NSCLC and that ACC inhibition by ND-646 is detrimental to NSCLC growth, supporting further examination of the use of ACC inhibitors in oncology.",

Currently, there are no therapies proven to prevent beta cell loss and some, namely insulin secretagogues, have been linked to accelerated beta cell failure, thereby limiting their use in type 2 diabetes3,4. The adipokine adipsin/complement factor D controls the alternative complement pathway and generation of complement component C3a, which acts to augment beta cell insulin secretion5. In contrast to other insulin secretagogues, we show that chronic replenishment of adipsin in diabetic db/db mice ameliorates hyperglycemia and increases insulin levels while preserving beta cells by blocking dedifferentiation and death. Mechanistically, we find that adipsin/C3a decreases the phosphatase Dusp26; forced expression of Dusp26 in beta cells decreases expression of core beta cell identity genes and sensitizes to cell death. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of DUSP26 improves hyperglycemia in diabetic mice and protects human islet cells from cell death. Pertaining to human health, we show that higher concentrations of circulating adipsin are associated with a significantly lower risk of developing future diabetes among middle-aged adults after adjusting for body mass index (BMI). Collectively, these data suggest that adipsin/C3a and DUSP26-directed therapies may represent a novel approach to achieve beta cell health to treat and prevent type 2 diabetes.",

Recent molecular characterization has defined new (epi)genetic drivers and potential targets for bladder cancer3,4. The immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy but only in a limited fraction of bladder cancer patients5-8. Here, we show that high G9a (EHMT2) expression is associated with poor clinical outcome in bladder cancer and that targeting G9a/DNMT methyltransferase activity with a novel inhibitor (CM-272) induces apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. Using an immunocompetent quadruple-knockout (PtenloxP/loxP; Trp53loxP/loxP; Rb1loxP/loxP; Rbl1-/-) transgenic mouse model of aggressive metastatic, muscle-invasive bladder cancer, we demonstrate that CM-272 + cisplatin treatment results in statistically significant regression of established tumors and metastases. The antitumor effect is significantly improved when CM-272 is combined with anti-programmed cell death ligand 1, even in the absence of cisplatin. These effects are associated with an endogenous antitumor immune response and immunogenic cell death with the conversion of a cold immune tumor into a hot tumor. Finally, increased G9a expression was associated with resistance to programmed cell death protein 1 inhibition in a cohort of patients with bladder cancer. In summary, these findings support new and promising opportunities for the treatment of bladder cancer using a combination of epigenetic inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade.",

Using a genome-scale T cell activity array, we identified Siglec-15 as a critical immune suppressor. While only expressed on some myeloid cells normally, Siglec-15 is broadly upregulated on human cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, and its expression is mutually exclusive to B7-H1, partially due to its induction by macrophage colony-stimulating factor and downregulation by IFN-γ. We demonstrate that Siglec-15 suppresses antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Genetic ablation or antibody blockade of Siglec-15 amplifies anti-tumor immunity in the TME and inhibits tumor growth in some mouse models. Taken together, our results support Siglec-15 as a potential target for normalization cancer immunotherapy.",

The identification of therapeutic targets in this disease has been challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of clinically actionable somatic mutations in chordoma tumors2,3. Here we describe the discovery of therapeutically targetable chordoma dependencies via genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening and focused small-molecule sensitivity profiling. These systematic approaches reveal that the developmental transcription factor T (brachyury; TBXT) is the top selectively essential gene in chordoma, and that transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors targeting CDK7/12/13 and CDK9 potently suppress chordoma cell proliferation. In other cancer types, transcriptional CDK inhibitors have been observed to downregulate highly expressed, enhancer-associated oncogenic transcription factors4,5. In chordoma, we find that T is associated with a 1.5-Mb region containing 'super-enhancers' and is the most highly expressed super-enhancer-associated transcription factor. Notably, transcriptional CDK inhibition leads to preferential and concentration-dependent downregulation of cellular brachyury protein levels in all models tested. In vivo, CDK7/12/13-inhibitor treatment substantially reduces tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate small-molecule targeting of brachyury transcription factor addiction in chordoma, identify a mechanism of T gene regulation that underlies this therapeutic strategy, and provide a blueprint for applying systematic genetic and chemical screening approaches to discover vulnerabilities in genomically quiet cancers.",

However, how this is molecularly achieved remains largely unresolved. Here, we develop an in vivo mouse model of liver cancer to study oncogene cooperation in immunosurveillance. We show that MYC overexpression (MYCTg) synergizes with KRASG12D to induce an aggressive liver tumor leading to metastasis formation and reduced mouse survival compared with KRASG12D alone. Genome-wide ribosomal footprinting of MYCTg;KRASG12 tumors compared with KRASG12D revealed potential alterations in translation of mRNAs, including programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Further analysis revealed that PD-L1 translation is repressed in KRASG12D tumors by functional, non-canonical upstream open reading frames in its 5' untranslated region, which is bypassed in MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors to evade immune attack. We show that this mechanism of PD-L1 translational upregulation was effectively targeted by a potent, clinical compound that inhibits eIF4E phosphorylation, eFT508, which reverses the aggressive and metastatic characteristics of MYCTg;KRASG12D tumors. Together, these studies reveal how immune-checkpoint proteins are manipulated by distinct oncogenes at the level of mRNA translation, which can be exploited for new immunotherapies.",

Here, we studied the clonal basis of response and acquired resistance to enasidenib treatment. Using sequential patient samples, we determined the clonal structure of hematopoietic cell populations at different stages of differentiation. Before therapy, IDH2-mutant clones showed variable differentiation arrest. Enasidenib treatment promoted hematopoietic differentiation from either terminal or ancestral mutant clones; less frequently, treatment promoted differentiation of nonmutant cells. Analysis of paired diagnosis/relapse samples did not identify second-site mutations in IDH2 at relapse. Instead, relapse arose by clonal evolution or selection of terminal or ancestral clones, thus highlighting multiple bypass pathways that could potentially be targeted to restore differentiation arrest. These results show how mapping of clonal structure in cell populations at different stages of differentiation can reveal the response and evolution of clones during treatment response and relapse.",

        "TEXT": "Small-molecule inhibitors of the serine dipeptidases DPP8 and DPP9 (DPP8/9) induce a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis in mouse and human monocytes and macrophages1,2. In mouse myeloid cells, Dpp8/9 inhibition activates the inflammasome sensor Nlrp1b, which in turn activates pro-caspase-1 to mediate cell death3, but the mechanism of DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pyroptosis in human myeloid cells is not yet known. Here we show that the CARD-containing protein CARD8 mediates DPP8/9 inhibitor-induced pro-caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in human myeloid cells. We further show that DPP8/9 inhibitors induce pyroptosis in the majority of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and primary AML samples, but not in cells from many other lineages, and that these inhibitors inhibit human AML progression in mouse models. Overall, this work identifies an activator of CARD8 in human cells and indicates that its activation by small-molecule DPP8/9 inhibitors represents a new potential therapeutic strategy for AML.",

However, combined deficiency in these three processes does not result in spontaneous tumor formation as observed upon loss of p53, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms that are critical mediators of p53-dependent tumor suppression function3-5. To define such mechanisms, we performed in vivo shRNA screens targeting p53-regulated genes in sensitized genetic backgrounds. We found that knockdown of Zmat3, Ctsf and Cav1, promoted lymphoma/leukemia development only when PUMA and p21, the critical effectors of p53-driven apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and senescence, were also absent. Notably, loss of the DNA repair gene Mlh1 caused lymphoma in a wild-type background, and its enforced expression was able to delay tumor development driven by loss of p53. Further examination of direct p53 target genes implicated in DNA repair showed that knockdown of Mlh1, Msh2, Rnf144b, Cav1 and Ddit4 accelerated MYC-driven lymphoma development to a similar extent as knockdown of p53. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that extensive functional overlap of several p53-regulated processes safeguards against cancer and that coordination of DNA repair appears to be an important process by which p53 suppresses tumor development.",

Its requirement for complete RAS-MAPK activation and its role as a negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling have established SHP2 as an essential player in oncogenic signaling pathways1-7. Recently, a novel potent allosteric SHP2 inhibitor was presented as a viable therapeutic option for receptor tyrosine kinase-driven cancers, but was shown to be ineffective in KRAS-mutant tumor cell lines in vitro8. Here, we report a central and indispensable role for SHP2 in oncogenic KRAS-driven tumors. Genetic deletion of Ptpn11 profoundly inhibited tumor development in mutant KRAS-driven murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. We provide evidence for a critical dependence of mutant KRAS on SHP2 during carcinogenesis. Deletion or inhibition of SHP2 in established tumors delayed tumor progression but was not sufficient to achieve tumor regression. However, SHP2 was necessary for resistance mechanisms upon blockade of MEK. Synergy was observed when both SHP2 and MEK were targeted, resulting in sustained tumor growth control in murine and human patient-derived organoids and xenograft models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and non-small-cell lung cancer. Our data indicate the clinical utility of dual SHP2/MEK inhibition as a targeted therapy approach for KRAS-mutant cancers.",

Here we report that the loss of adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) in intestinal tumor cells or of the tumor suppressor PTEN in melanoma cells upregulates the expression of Dickkopf-related protein 2 (DKK2), which, together with its receptor LRP5, provides an unconventional mechanism for tumor immune evasion. DKK2 secreted by tumor cells acts on cytotoxic lymphocytes, inhibiting STAT5 signaling by impeding STAT5 nuclear localization via LRP5, but independently of LRP6 and the Wnt-β-catenin pathway. Genetic or antibody-mediated ablation of DKK2 activates natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells in tumors, impedes tumor progression, and enhances the effects of PD-1 blockade. Thus, we have identified a previously unknown tumor immune-suppressive mechanism and immunotherapeutic targets particularly relevant for CRCs and a subset of melanomas.",

Although most cases of BCC are sporadic, some forms are inherited, such as Bazex-Dupré-Christol syndrome (BDCS)-a cancer-prone genodermatosis with an X-linked, dominant inheritance pattern. We have identified mutations in the ACTRT1 gene, which encodes actin-related protein T1 (ARP-T1), in two of the six families with BDCS that were examined in this study. High-throughput sequencing in the four remaining families identified germline mutations in noncoding sequences surrounding ACTRT1. These mutations were located in transcribed sequences encoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and were shown to impair enhancer activity and ACTRT1 expression. ARP-T1 was found to directly bind to the GLI1 promoter, thus inhibiting GLI1 expression, and loss of ARP-T1 led to activation of the Hedgehog pathway in individuals with BDCS. Moreover, exogenous expression of ACTRT1 reduced the in vitro and in vivo proliferation rates of cell lines with aberrant activation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. In summary, our study identifies a disease mechanism in BCC involving mutations in regulatory noncoding elements and uncovers the tumor-suppressor properties of ACTRT1.",

Although activation of the innate immune system has been linked to the behavioral and cognitive effects that are associated with infection, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we mimicked viral immune activation with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA, and longitudinally imaged postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer V pyramidal neurons in the mouse primary motor cortex using two-photon microscopy. We found that peripheral immune activation caused dendritic spine loss, impairments in learning-dependent dendritic spine formation and deficits in multiple learning tasks in mice. These observed synaptic alterations in the cortex were mediated by peripheral-monocyte-derived cells and did not require microglial function in the central nervous system. Furthermore, activation of CX3CR1highLy6Clow monocytes impaired motor learning and learning-related dendritic spine plasticity through tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α-dependent mechanisms. Taken together, our results highlight CX3CR1high monocytes and TNF-α as potential therapeutic targets for preventing infection-induced cognitive dysfunction.",

        "TEXT": "Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for human cancers is not curative, and relapse occurs owing to the continued presence of tumor cells, referred to as minimal residual disease (MRD). The survival of MRD stem or progenitor cells in the absence of oncogenic kinase signaling, a phenomenon referred to as intrinsic resistance, depends on diverse growth factors. Here we report that oncogenic kinase and growth-factor signaling converge to induce the expression of the signaling proteins FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-FOS, encoded by Fos) and dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Genetic deletion of Fos and Dusp1 suppressed tumor growth in a BCR-ABL fusion protein kinase-induced mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacological inhibition of c-FOS, DUSP1 and BCR-ABL eradicated MRD in multiple in vivo models, as well as in mice xenotransplanted with patient-derived primary CML cells. Growth-factor signaling also conferred TKI resistance and induced FOS and DUSP1 expression in tumor cells modeling other types of kinase-driven leukemias. Our data demonstrate that c-FOS and DUSP1 expression levels determine the threshold of TKI efficacy, such that growth-factor-induced expression of c-FOS and DUSP1 confers intrinsic resistance to TKI therapy in a wide-ranging set of leukemias, and might represent a unifying Achilles' heel of kinase-driven cancers.",

        "TEXT": "Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is an aggressive brain tumor that is located in the pons and primarily affects children. Nearly 80% of DIPGs harbor mutations in histone H3 genes, wherein lysine 27 is substituted with methionine (H3K27M). H3K27M has been shown to inhibit polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a multiprotein complex responsible for the methylation of H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me), by binding to its catalytic subunit EZH2. Although DIPGs with the H3K27M mutation show global loss of H3K27me3, several genes retain H3K27me3. Here we describe a mouse model of DIPG in which H3K27M potentiates tumorigenesis. Using this model and primary patient-derived DIPG cell lines, we show that H3K27M-expressing tumors require PRC2 for proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that small-molecule EZH2 inhibitors abolish tumor cell growth through a mechanism that is dependent on the induction of the tumor-suppressor protein p16INK4A. Genome-wide enrichment analyses show that the genes that retain H3K27me3 in H3K27M cells are strong polycomb targets. Furthermore, we find a highly significant overlap between genes that retain H3K27me3 in the DIPG mouse model and in human primary DIPGs expressing H3K27M. Taken together, these results show that residual PRC2 activity is required for the proliferation of H3K27M-expressing DIPGs, and that inhibition of EZH2 is a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of these tumors.",

        "TEXT": "In a search for mediators of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which induces pleiotropic and often antagonistic cellular responses, we identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1. NEAT1 is an essential architectural component of paraspeckle nuclear bodies, whose pathophysiological relevance remains unclear. Activation of p53, pharmacologically or by oncogene-induced replication stress, stimulated the formation of paraspeckles in mouse and human cells. Silencing Neat1 expression in mice, which prevents paraspeckle formation, sensitized preneoplastic cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death and impaired skin tumorigenesis. We provide mechanistic evidence that NEAT1 promotes ATR signaling in response to replication stress and is thereby engaged in a negative feedback loop that attenuates oncogene-dependent activation of p53. NEAT1 targeting in established human cancer cell lines induced synthetic lethality with genotoxic chemotherapeutics, including PARP inhibitors, and nongenotoxic activation of p53. This study establishes a key genetic link between NEAT1 paraspeckles, p53 biology and tumorigenesis and identifies NEAT1 as a promising target to enhance sensitivity of cancer cells to both chemotherapy and p53 reactivation therapy.",

        "TEXT": "Single-agent immunotherapy has achieved limited clinical benefit to date in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This may be a result of the presence of a uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Critical obstacles to immunotherapy in PDAC tumors include a high number of tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells and a uniquely desmoplastic stroma that functions as a barrier to T cell infiltration. We identified hyperactivated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity in neoplastic PDAC cells as an important regulator of the fibrotic and immunosuppressive TME. We found that FAK activity was elevated in human PDAC tissues and correlated with high levels of fibrosis and poor CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Single-agent FAK inhibition using the selective FAK inhibitor VS-4718 substantially limited tumor progression, resulting in a doubling of survival in the p48-Cre;LSL-Kras(G12D);Trp53(flox/+) (KPC) mouse model of human PDAC. This delay in tumor progression was associated with markedly reduced tumor fibrosis and decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive cells. We also found that FAK inhibition rendered the previously unresponsive KPC mouse model responsive to T cell immunotherapy and PD-1 antagonists. These data suggest that FAK inhibition increases immune surveillance by overcoming the fibrotic and immunosuppressive PDAC TME and renders tumors responsive to immunotherapy.",

Postzygotic somatic mutations activating the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway are found in a wide range of brain diseases, including FMCDs. It remains unclear how a mutation in a small fraction of cells disrupts the architecture of the entire hemisphere. Within human FMCD-affected brain, we found that cells showing activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway were enriched for the AKT3(E17K) mutation. Introducing the FMCD-causing mutation into mouse brain resulted in electrographic seizures and impaired hemispheric architecture. Mutation-expressing neural progenitors showed misexpression of reelin, which led to a non-cell autonomous migration defect in neighboring cells, due at least in part to derepression of reelin transcription in a manner dependent on the forkhead box (FOX) transcription factor FOXG1. Treatments aimed at either blocking downstream AKT signaling or inactivating reelin restored migration. These findings suggest a central AKT-FOXG1-reelin signaling pathway in FMCD and support pathway inhibitors as potential treatments or therapies for some forms of focal epilepsy.",

Here we tested small-molecule inhibitors targeting chromatin regulators as possible therapeutic agents in PDAC. We show that JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, suppresses PDAC development in mice by inhibiting both MYC activity and inflammatory signals. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA synergizes with JQ1 to augment cell death and more potently suppress advanced PDAC. Finally, using a CRISPR-Cas9-based method for gene editing directly in the mouse adult pancreas, we show that de-repression of p57 (also known as KIP2 or CDKN1C) upon combined BET and HDAC inhibition is required for the induction of combination therapy-induced cell death in PDAC. SAHA is approved for human use, and molecules similar to JQ1 are being tested in clinical trials. Thus, these studies identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be rapidly implemented in fatal human tumors.",

Here we demonstrate a crucial role for interleukin (IL)-9 in antitumor immunity generated by the GITR agonistic antibody DTA-1. IL-4 receptor knockout (Il4ra(-/-)) mice, which have reduced expression of IL-9, were resistant to tumor growth inhibition by DTA-1. Notably, neutralization of IL-9 considerably impaired tumor rejection induced by DTA-1. In particular, DTA-1-induced IL-9 promoted tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses by enhancing the function of dendritic cells in vivo. Furthermore, GITR signaling enhanced the differentiation of IL-9-producing CD4(+) T-helper (TH9) cells in a TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)- and NF-κB-dependent manner and inhibited the generation of induced regulatory T cells in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that GITR co-stimulation mediates antitumor immunity by promoting TH9 cell differentiation and enhancing CTL responses and thus provide a mechanism of action for GITR agonist-mediated cancer immunotherapies.",

Notably, ARID1A is mutated in over 50% of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which currently have no effective therapy. To date, clinically applicable targeted cancer therapy based on ARID1A mutational status has not been described. Here we show that inhibition of the EZH2 methyltransferase acts in a synthetic lethal manner in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells and that ARID1A mutational status correlated with response to the EZH2 inhibitor. We identified PIK3IP1 as a direct target of ARID1A and EZH2 that is upregulated by EZH2 inhibition and contributed to the observed synthetic lethality by inhibiting PI3K-AKT signaling. Importantly, EZH2 inhibition caused regression of ARID1A-mutated ovarian tumors in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first data set to demonstrate a synthetic lethality between ARID1A mutation and EZH2 inhibition. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 represents a novel treatment strategy for cancers involving ARID1A mutations.",

Here we performed a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that are synthetic lethal to the IDH1(R132H) mutation in AML and identified the anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2. IDH1- and IDH2-mutant primary human AML cells were more sensitive than IDH1/2 wild-type cells to ABT-199, a highly specific BCL-2 inhibitor that is currently in clinical trials for hematologic malignancies, both ex vivo and in xenotransplant models. This sensitization effect was induced by (R)-2-HG-mediated inhibition of the activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC); suppression of COX activity lowered the mitochondrial threshold to trigger apoptosis upon BCL-2 inhibition. Our findings indicate that IDH1/2 mutation status may identify patients that are likely to respond to pharmacologic BCL-2 inhibition and form the rational basis for combining agents that disrupt ETC activity with ABT-199 in future clinical studies.",

        "TEXT": "We searched for genetic alterations in human B cell lymphoma that affect the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This approach identified FBXO25 within a minimal common region of frequent deletion in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). FBXO25 encodes an orphan F-box protein that determines the substrate specificity of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)(FBXO25) ubiquitin ligase complex. An unbiased screen uncovered the prosurvival protein HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) as the bona fide substrate of FBXO25 that is targeted after apoptotic stresses. Protein kinase Cδ (PRKCD) initiates this process by phosphorylating FBXO25 and HAX-1, thereby spatially directing nuclear FBXO25 to mitochondrial HAX-1. Our analyses in primary human MCL identify monoallelic loss of FBXO25 and stabilizing HAX1 phosphodegron mutations. Accordingly, FBXO25 re-expression in FBXO25-deleted MCL cells promotes cell death, whereas expression of the HAX-1 phosphodegron mutant inhibits apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of FBXO25 significantly accelerated lymphoma development in Eμ-Myc mice and in a human MCL xenotransplant model. Together we identify a PRKCD-dependent proapoptotic mechanism controlling HAX-1 stability, and we propose that FBXO25 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and that HAX1 is a proto-oncogene in MCL.",

However, whether HSC progeny can serve directly as HSC niche cells has not previously been shown. Here we report a dichotomous role of megakaryocytes (MKs) in both maintaining HSC quiescence during homeostasis and promoting HSC regeneration after chemotherapeutic stress. We show that MKs are physically associated with HSCs in the bone marrow of mice and that MK ablation led to activation of quiescent HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that transforming growth factor β1 (encoded by Tgfb1) is expressed at higher levels in MKs as compared to other stromal niche cells. MK ablation led to reduced levels of biologically active TGF-β1 protein in the bone marrow and nuclear-localized phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3) in HSCs, suggesting that MKs maintain HSC quiescence through TGF-β-SMAD signaling. Indeed, TGF-β1 injection into mice in which MKs had been ablated restored HSC quiescence, and conditional deletion of Tgfb1 in MKs increased HSC activation and proliferation. These data demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a dominant signal emanating from MKs that maintains HSC quiescence. However, under conditions of chemotherapeutic challenge, MK ablation resulted in a severe defect in HSC expansion. In response to stress, fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) signaling from MKs transiently dominates over TGF-β inhibitory signaling to stimulate HSC expansion. Overall, these observations demonstrate that MKs serve as HSC-derived niche cells to dynamically regulate HSC function.",

The disability, mortality and costs caused by osteoporosis-induced nonvertebral fractures are enormous. We demonstrate here that Wnt16-deficient mice develop spontaneous fractures as a result of low cortical thickness and high cortical porosity. In contrast, trabecular bone volume is not altered in these mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that WNT16 is osteoblast derived and inhibits human and mouse osteoclastogenesis both directly by acting on osteoclast progenitors and indirectly by increasing expression of osteoprotegerin (Opg) in osteoblasts. The signaling pathway activated by WNT16 in osteoclast progenitors is noncanonical, whereas the pathway activated in osteoblasts is both canonical and noncanonical. Conditional Wnt16 inactivation revealed that osteoblast-lineage cells are the principal source of WNT16, and its targeted deletion in osteoblasts increases fracture susceptibility. Thus, osteoblast-derived WNT16 is a previously unreported key regulator of osteoclastogenesis and fracture susceptibility. These findings open new avenues for the specific prevention or treatment of nonvertebral fractures, a substantial unmet medical need.",

Bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the male population of the United States. Thus far, driver mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and, less commonly, in RAS proteins have been identified. We show that Notch activation in bladder cancer cells suppresses proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by directly upregulating dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), thus reducing the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2).

We found pervasive DNA damage in hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma, lymphoma and leukemia, which leads to activation of a p53-independent, proapoptotic network centered on nuclear relocalization of ABL1 kinase. Although nuclear ABL1 triggers cell death through its interaction with the Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 in normal cells, we show that low YAP1 levels prevent nuclear ABL1-induced apoptosis in these hematologic malignancies. YAP1 is under the control of a serine-threonine kinase, STK4. Notably, genetic inactivation of STK4 restores YAP1 levels, triggering cell death in vitro and in vivo. Our data therefore identify a new synthetic-lethal strategy to selectively target cancer cells presenting with endogenous DNA damage and low YAP1 levels.",

We detected selective expression of the death mediator Fas ligand (FasL, also called CD95L) in the vasculature of human and mouse solid tumors but not in normal vasculature. In these tumors, FasL expression was associated with scarce CD8(+) infiltration and a predominance of FoxP3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells. Tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) cooperatively induced FasL expression in endothelial cells, which acquired the ability to kill effector CD8(+) T cells but not Treg cells because of higher levels of c-FLIP expression in Treg cells. In mice, genetic or pharmacologic suppression of FasL produced a substantial increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8(+) over FoxP3(+) T cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of VEGF and PGE2 produced a marked increase in the influx of tumor-rejecting CD8(+) over FoxP3(+) T cells that was dependent on attenuation of FasL expression and led to CD8-dependent tumor growth suppression. Thus, tumor paracrine mechanisms establish a tumor endothelial death barrier, which has a critical role in establishing immune tolerance and determining the fate of tumors.",

Here we show that endothelial miR-126-5p maintains a proliferative reserve in ECs through suppression of the Notch1 inhibitor delta-like 1 homolog (Dlk1) and thereby prevents atherosclerotic lesion formation. Endothelial recovery after denudation was impaired in Mir126(-/-) mice because lack of miR-126-5p, but not miR-126-3p, reduced EC proliferation by derepressing Dlk1. At nonpredilection sites, high miR-126-5p levels in endothelial cells confer a proliferative reserve that compensates for the antiproliferative effects of hyperlipidemia, such that atherosclerosis was exacerbated in Mir126(-/-) mice. In contrast, downregulation of miR-126-5p by disturbed flow abrogated EC proliferation at predilection sites in response to hyperlipidemic stress through upregulation of Dlk1 expression. Administration of miR-126-5p rescued EC proliferation at predilection sites and limited atherosclerosis, introducing a potential therapeutic approach.",

Consequently, identification of vulnerabilities conferred by ARID1A mutation would have major relevance for human cancer. Here, using a broad screening approach, we identify ARID1B, an ARID1A homolog whose gene product is mutually exclusive with ARID1A in SWI/SNF complexes, as the number 1 gene preferentially required for the survival of ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines. We show that loss of ARID1B in ARID1A-deficient backgrounds destabilizes SWI/SNF and impairs proliferation in both cancer cells and primary cells. We also find that ARID1A and ARID1B are frequently co-mutated in cancer but that ARID1A-deficient cancers retain at least one functional ARID1B allele. These results suggest that loss of ARID1A and ARID1B alleles cooperatively promotes cancer formation but also results in a unique functional dependence. The results further identify ARID1B as a potential therapeutic target for ARID1A-mutant cancers.",

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Gαs restricts bone formation to the skeleton by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling in mesenchymal progenitor cells. In progressive osseous heteroplasia, a human disease caused by null mutations in GNAS, which encodes Gαs, Hedgehog signaling is upregulated in ectopic osteoblasts and progenitor cells. In animal models, we show that genetically-mediated ectopic Hedgehog signaling is sufficient to induce heterotopic ossification, whereas inhibition of this signaling pathway by genetic or pharmacological means strongly reduces the severity of this condition. As our previous work has shown that GNAS gain-of-function mutations upregulate WNT-β-catenin signaling in osteoblast progenitor cells, resulting in their defective differentiation and fibrous dysplasia, we identify Gαs as a key regulator of proper osteoblast differentiation through its maintenance of a balance between the Wnt-β-catenin and Hedgehog pathways. Also, given the results here of the pharmacological studies in our mouse model, we propose that Hedgehog inhibitors currently used in the clinic for other conditions, such as cancer, may possibly be repurposed for treating heterotopic ossification and other diseases caused by GNAS inactivation.",

Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells are therefore considered promising targets to enhance antitumor immunity, and approaches for their therapeutic modulation are being developed. However, although studies showing that experimentally depleting Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells can enhance antitumor responses provide proof of principle, these studies lack clear translational potential and have various shortcomings. Histone/protein acetyltransferases (HATs) promote chromatin accessibility, gene transcription and the function of multiple transcription factors and nonhistone proteins. We now report that conditional deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of one HAT, p300 (also known as Ep300 or KAT3B), in Foxp3(+) T(reg) cells increased T cell receptor-induced apoptosis in T(reg) cells, impaired T(reg) cell suppressive function and peripheral T(reg) cell induction, and limited tumor growth in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice. Our data thereby demonstrate that p300 is important for Foxp3(+) T(reg) cell function and homeostasis in vivo and in vitro, and identify mechanisms by which appropriate small-molecule inhibitors can diminish T(reg) cell function without overtly impairing T effector cell responses or inducing autoimmunity.

The NVU is comprised of endothelial cells that are interconnected by tight junctions resting on a parenchymal basement membrane ensheathed by pericytes, smooth muscle cells and a layer of astrocyte end feet. Circulating blood cells, such as leukocytes, complete the NVU. BBB disruption is common in several neurological diseases, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. We analyzed the role of TWIK-related potassium channel-1 (TREK1, encoded by KCNK2) in human and mouse endothelial cells and the BBB. TREK1 was downregulated in endothelial cells by treatment with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Blocking TREK1 increased leukocyte transmigration, whereas TREK1 activation had the opposite effect. We identified altered mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, actin remodeling and upregulation of cellular adhesion molecules as potential mechanisms of increased migration in TREK1-deficient (Kcnk2(-/-)) cells. In Kcnk2(-/-) mice, brain endothelial cells showed an upregulation of the cellular adhesion molecules ICAM1, VCAM1 and PECAM1 and facilitated leukocyte trafficking into the CNS. Following the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG)35-55 peptide, Kcnk2(-/-) mice showed higher EAE severity scores that were accompanied by increased cellular infiltrates in the central nervous system (CNS). The severity of EAE was attenuated in mice given the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug riluzole or fed a diet enriched with linseed oil (which contains the TREK-1 activating omega-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid). These beneficial effects were reduced in Kcnk2(-/-) mice, suggesting TREK-1",

Hepatic overexpression of miR-30c reduced hyperlipidemia in Western diet-fed mice by decreasing lipid synthesis and the secretion of triglyceride-rich ApoB-containing lipoproteins and decreased atherosclerosis in Apoe(-/-) mice. Furthermore, inhibition of hepatic miR-30c by anti-miR-30c increased hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Therefore, miR-30c coordinately reduces lipid biosynthesis and lipoprotein secretion, thereby regulating hepatic and plasma lipid concentrations.

Among RNA viruses, replication fidelity is recognized as a key determinant of virulence and escape from antiviral therapy; increased fidelity is attenuating for some viruses. Coronavirus (CoV) replication fidelity is approximately 20-fold greater than that of other RNA viruses and is mediated by a 3'→5' exonuclease (ExoN) activity that probably functions in RNA proofreading. In this study we demonstrate that engineered inactivation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV ExoN activity results in a stable mutator phenotype with profoundly decreased fidelity in vivo and attenuation of pathogenesis in young, aged and immunocompromised mice. The ExoN inactivation genotype and mutator phenotype are stable and do not revert to virulence, even after serial passage or long-term persistent infection in vivo. ExoN inactivation has potential for broad applications in the stable attenuation of CoVs and, perhaps, other RNA viruses.",

Combining high-throughput RNA sequencing, functional characterization, mechanistic studies and clinical validation, we identify leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor downstream of the microRNA miR-9 and upstream of Hippo signaling. Restoring LIFR expression in highly malignant tumor cells suppresses metastasis by triggering a Hippo kinase cascade that leads to phosphorylation, cytoplasmic retention and functional inactivation of the transcriptional coactivator YES-associated protein (YAP). Conversely, loss of LIFR in nonmetastatic breast cancer cells induces migration, invasion and metastatic colonization through activation of YAP. LIFR is downregulated in human breast carcinomas and inversely correlates with metastasis. Notably, in approximately 1,000 nonmetastatic breast tumors, LIFR expression status correlated with metastasis-free, recurrence-free and overall survival outcomes in the patients. These findings identify LIFR as a metastasis suppressor that functions through the Hippo-YAP pathway and has significant prognostic power.",

Global or endothelial-cell-specific deficiency of PI3K-C2α resulted in embryonic lethality caused by defects in sprouting angiogenesis and vascular maturation. PI3K-C2α knockdown in endothelial cells resulted in a decrease in the number of PI3-phosphate-enriched endosomes, impaired endosomal trafficking, defective delivery of VE-cadherin to endothelial cell junctions and defective junction assembly. PI3K-C2α knockdown also impaired endothelial cell signaling, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor internalization and endosomal RhoA activation. Together, the effects of PI3K-C2α knockdown led to defective endothelial cell migration, proliferation, tube formation and barrier integrity. Endothelial PI3K-C2α deficiency in vivo suppressed postischemic and tumor angiogenesis and diminished vascular barrier function with a greatly augmented susceptibility to anaphylaxis and a higher incidence of dissecting aortic aneurysm formation in response to angiotensin II infusion. Thus, PI3K-C2α has a crucial role in vascular formation and barrier integrity and represents a new therapeutic target for vascular disease.",

The approval of bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma validated the 20S core particle as an anticancer drug target. Here we describe the small molecule b-AP15 as a previously unidentified class of proteasome inhibitor that abrogates the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle. b-AP15 inhibited the activity of two 19S regulatory-particle-associated deubiquitinases, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 5 (UCHL5) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), resulting in accumulation of polyubiquitin. b-AP15 induced tumor cell apoptosis that was insensitive to TP53 status and overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL2. We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target.",

        "TEXT": "Infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) are prevalent but distinct causes of reproductive failure that often remain unexplained despite extensive investigations. Analysis of midsecretory endometrial samples revealed that SGK1, a kinase involved in epithelial ion transport and cell survival, is upregulated in unexplained infertility, most prominently in the luminal epithelium, but downregulated in the endometrium of women suffering from RPL. To determine the functional importance of these observations, we first expressed a constitutively active SGK1 mutant in the luminal epithelium of the mouse uterus. This prevented expression of certain endometrial receptivity genes, perturbed uterine fluid handling and abolished embryo implantation. By contrast, implantation was unhindered in Sgk1-/- mice, but pregnancy was often complicated by bleeding at the decidual-placental interface and fetal growth retardation and subsequent demise. Compared to wild-type mice, Sgk1-/- mice had gross impairment of pregnancy-dependent induction of genes involved in oxidative stress defenses. Relative SGK1 deficiency was also a hallmark of decidualizing stromal cells from human subjects with RPL and sensitized these cells to oxidative cell death. Thus, depending on the cellular compartment, deregulated SGK1 activity in cycling endometrium interferes with embryo implantation, leading to infertility, or predisposes to pregnancy complications by rendering the feto-maternal interface vulnerable to oxidative damage.",

To clarify the function of PICT1, we generated Pict1-deficient mice and embryonic stem (ES) cells. Pict1 is a nucleolar protein essential for embryogenesis and ES cell survival. Even without DNA damage, Pict1 loss led to p53-dependent arrest of cell cycle phase G(1) and apoptosis. Pict1-deficient cells accumulated p53, owing to impaired Mdm2 function. Pict1 binds Rpl11, and Rpl11 is released from nucleoli in the absence of Pict1. In Pict1-deficient cells, increased binding of Rpl11 to Mdm2 blocks Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination of p53. In human cancer, individuals whose tumors express less PICT1 have better prognoses. When PICT1 is depleted in tumor cells with intact P53 signaling, the cells grow more slowly and accumulate P53. Thus, PICT1 is a potent regulator of the MDM2-P53 pathway and promotes tumor progression by retaining RPL11 in the nucleolus.",

These mice showed all features of CMT or distal HMN dependent on the mutation. Expression of mutant HSPB1 decreased acetylated α-tubulin abundance and induced severe axonal transport deficits. An increase of α-tubulin acetylation induced by pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) corrected the axonal transport defects caused by HSPB1 mutations and rescued the CMT phenotype of symptomatic mutant HSPB1 mice.

Repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) is an axon guidance molecule that has a role in the visual system and in neural tube closure. Our study shows that RGMa is expressed in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and that CD4(+) T cells express neogenin, a receptor for RGMa. Binding of RGMa to CD4(+) T cells led to activation of the small GTPase Rap1 and increased adhesion of T cells to intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Neutralizing antibodies to RGMa attenuated clinical symptoms of mouse myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and reduced invasion of inflammatory cells into the CNS. Silencing of RGMa in MOG-pulsed BMDCs reduced their capacity to induce EAE following adoptive transfer to naive C57BL/6 mice. CD4(+) T cells isolated from mice treated with an RGMa-specific antibody showed diminished proliferative responses and reduced interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4 and IL-17 secretion. Incubation of PBMCs from patients with multiple sclerosis with an RGMa-specific antibody reduced proliferative responses and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. These results demonstrate that an RGMa-specific antibody suppresses T cell responses, and suggest that RGMa could be a promising molecular target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.",

Comparing gene expression in isogenic androgen-dependent and CRPC xenografts, we found a reproducible increase in N-cadherin expression, which was also elevated in primary and metastatic tumors of individuals with CRPC. Ectopic expression of N-cadherin in nonmetastatic, androgen-dependent prostate cancer models caused castration resistance, invasion and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies against the ectodomain of N-cadherin reduced proliferation, adhesion and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, these antibodies slowed the growth of multiple established CRPC xenografts, blocked local invasion and metastasis and, at higher doses, led to complete regression. N-cadherin-specific antibodies markedly delayed the time to emergence of castration resistance, markedly affected tumor histology and angiogenesis, and reduced both AKT serine-threonine kinase activity and serum interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion. These data indicate that N-cadherin is a major cause of both prostate cancer metastasis and castration resistance. Therapeutic targeting of this factor with monoclonal antibodies may have considerable clinical benefit.",

Although reversing PD-1 inhibition is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy, the cellular mechanisms by which PD-1 ligation results in T cell inhibition are not fully understood. PD-1 is thought to limit T cell activation by attenuating T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. It is not known whether PD-1 also acts by upregulating genes in exhausted T cells that impair their function. Here we analyzed gene expression profiles from HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells in individuals with HIV and show that PD-1 coordinately upregulates a program of genes in exhausted CD8(+) T cells from humans and mice. This program includes upregulation of basic leucine transcription factor, ATF-like (BATF), a transcription factor in the AP-1 family. Enforced expression of BATF was sufficient to impair T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion, whereas BATF knockdown reduced PD-1 inhibition. Silencing BATF in T cells from individuals with chronic viremia rescued HIV-specific T cell function. Thus, inhibitory receptors can cause T cell exhaustion by upregulating genes--such as BATF--that inhibit T cell function. Such genes may provide new therapeutic opportunities to improve T cell immunity to HIV.",

        "TEXT": "Although it is well established that tumors initiate an angiogenic switch, the molecular basis of this process remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the miRNA miR-132 acts as an angiogenic switch by targeting p120RasGAP in the endothelium and thereby inducing neovascularization. We identified miR-132 as a highly upregulated miRNA in a human embryonic stem cell model of vasculogenesis and found that miR-132 was highly expressed in the endothelium of human tumors and hemangiomas but was undetectable in normal endothelium. Ectopic expression of miR-132 in endothelial cells in vitro increased their proliferation and tube-forming capacity, whereas intraocular injection of an antagomir targeting miR-132, anti-miR-132, reduced postnatal retinal vascular development in mice. Among the top-ranking predicted targets of miR-132 was p120RasGAP, which we found to be expressed in normal but not tumor endothelium. Endothelial expression of miR-132 suppressed p120RasGAP expression and increased Ras activity, whereas a miRNA-resistant version of p120RasGAP reversed the vascular response induced by miR-132. Notably, administration of anti-miR-132 inhibited angiogenesis in wild-type mice but not in mice with an inducible deletion of Rasa1 (encoding p120RasGAP). Finally, vessel-targeted nanoparticle delivery of anti-miR-132 restored p120RasGAP expression in the tumor endothelium, suppressed angiogenesis and decreased tumor burden in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of human breast carcinoma. We conclude that miR-132 acts as an angiogenic switch by suppressing endothelial p120RasGAP expression, leading to Ras activation and the induction of neovascularization, whereas the application of anti-miR-132 inhibits neovascularization by maintaining vessels in the resting state.",

Here we show NOD2 triggering by muramyldipeptide induces autophagy in DCs. This effect requires receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase-2 (RIPK-2), autophagy-related protein-5 (ATG5), ATG7 and ATG16L1 but not NLR family, pyrin domain containing-3 (NALP3).We show that NOD2-mediated autophagy is required for both bacterial handling and generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell responses in DCs. DCs from individuals with Crohn's disease expressing Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 or ATG16L1 risk variants are defective in autophagy induction, bacterial trafficking and antigen presentation. Our findings link two Crohn's disease-associated susceptibility genes in a single functional pathway and reveal defects in this pathway in Crohn's disease DCs that could lead to bacterial persistence via impaired lysosomal destruction and immune mediated clearance.",

It is also known that aberrant Hh signaling can lead to cancer, but the role of primary cilia in oncogenesis is not known. Cerebellar granule neuron precursors (GNPs) can give rise to medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. The primary cilium and Hh signaling are required for GNP proliferation. We asked whether primary cilia in GNPs have a role in medulloblastoma growth in mice. Genetic ablation of primary cilia blocked medulloblastoma formation when this tumor was driven by a constitutively active Smoothened protein (Smo), an upstream activator of Hh signaling. In contrast, removal of cilia was required for medulloblastoma growth by a constitutively active glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger-2 (GLI2), a downstream transcription factor. Thus, primary cilia are either required for or inhibit medulloblastoma formation, depending on the initiating oncogenic event. Remarkably, the presence or absence of cilia was associated with specific variants of human medulloblastomas; primary cilia were found in medulloblastomas with activation in HH or WNT signaling but not in most medulloblastomas in other distinct molecular subgroups. Primary cilia could serve as a diagnostic tool and provide new insights into the mechanism of tumorigenesis.",

In this study, we used autophagy to enhance vaccine efficacy against tuberculosis in a mouse model. We examined the effect of autophagy on the processing of the immunodominant mycobacterial antigen Ag85B by antigen presenting cells (APCs), macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). We found that rapamycin-induced autophagy enhanced Ag85B presentation by APCs infected with wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, H37Rv-derived DeltafbpA attenuated candidate vaccine or BCG. Furthermore, rapamycin enhanced localization of mycobacteria with autophagosomes and lysosomes. Rapamycin-enhanced antigen presentation was attenuated when autophagy was suppressed by 3-methyladenine or by small interfering RNA against beclin-1. Notably, mice immunized with rapamycin-treated DCs infected with either DeltafbpA or BCG showed enhanced T helper type 1-mediated protection when challenged with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Finally, overexpression of Ag85B in BCG induced autophagy in APCs and enhanced immunogenicity in mice, suggesting that vaccine efficacy can be enhanced by augmenting autophagy-mediated antigen presentation.",

Beta1 and beta2 integrin function on leukocytes is crucial for a successful immune response and the platelet integrin alpha(IIb)beta3 initiates the process of blood clotting through binding fibrinogen. Integrins on circulating cells bind poorly to their ligands but become active after 'inside-out' signaling through other membrane receptors. Subjects with leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-I) do not express beta2 integrins because of mutations in the gene specifying the beta2 subunit, and they suffer recurrent bacterial infections. Mutations affecting alpha(IIb)beta3 integrin cause the bleeding disorder termed Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Subjects with LAD-III show symptoms of both LAD-I and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. Their hematopoietically-derived cells express beta1, beta2 and beta3 integrins, but defective inside-out signaling causes immune deficiency and bleeding problems. The LAD-III lesion has been attributed to a C --> A mutation in the gene encoding calcium and diacylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factor (CALDAGGEF1; official symbol RASGRP2) specifying the CALDAG-GEF1 protein, but we show that this change is not responsible for the LAD-III disorder. Instead, we identify mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3) gene specifying the KINDLIN-3 protein as the cause of LAD-III in Maltese and Turkish subjects. Two independent mutations result in decreased KINDLIN3 messenger RNA levels and loss of protein expression. Notably, transfection of the subjects' lymphocytes with KINDLIN3 complementary DNA but not CALDAGGEF1 cDNA reverses the LAD-III defect, restoring integrin-mediated adhesion and migration.",

It remains untested whether malformations caused by disorders in neuronal migration can be reduced by reactivating cellular migration and whether such repair can decrease seizure risk. Here we show, in a rat model of subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) generated by in utero RNA interference of the Dcx gene, that aberrantly positioned neurons can be stimulated to migrate by reexpressing Dcx after birth. Restarting migration in this way both reduces neocortical malformations and restores neuronal patterning. We further find that the capacity to reduce SBH continues into early postnatal development. Moreover, intervention after birth reduces the convulsant-induced seizure threshold to a level similar to that in malformation-free controls. These results suggest that disorders of neuronal migration may be eventually treatable by reengaging developmental programs both to reduce the size of cortical malformations and to reduce seizure risk.",

        "TEXT": "The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder that affects approximately one percent of the world population, are not well understood. Using a mouse model of epilepsy, we show that seizures induce elevated expression of vascular cell adhesion molecules and enhanced leukocyte rolling and arrest in brain vessels mediated by the leukocyte mucin P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1, encoded by Selplg) and leukocyte integrins alpha(4)beta(1) and alpha(L)beta(2). Inhibition of leukocyte-vascular interactions, either with blocking antibodies or by genetically interfering with PSGL-1 function in mice, markedly reduced seizures. Treatment with blocking antibodies after acute seizures prevented the development of epilepsy. Neutrophil depletion also inhibited acute seizure induction and chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, which is known to enhance neuronal excitability, was induced by acute seizure activity but was prevented by blockade of leukocyte-vascular adhesion, suggesting a pathogenetic link between leukocyte-vascular interactions, BBB damage and seizure generation. Consistent with the potential leukocyte involvement in epilepsy in humans, leukocytes were more abundant in brains of individuals with epilepsy than in controls. Our results suggest leukocyte-endothelial interaction as a potential target for the prevention and treatment of epilepsy.",

Phenotypically, retinoic acid induces differentiation of APL cells. Here we show that retinoic acid also triggers growth arrest of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) ex vivo and their clearance in PML-RARA mouse APL in vivo. Retinoic acid treatment of mouse APLs expressing the fusion protein PLZF-RARA triggers full differentiation, but not LIC loss or disease remission, establishing that differentiation and LIC loss can be uncoupled. Although retinoic acid and arsenic synergize to clear LICs through cooperative PML-RARA degradation, this combination does not enhance differentiation. A cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation site in PML-RARA is crucial for retinoic acid-induced PML-RARA degradation and LIC clearance. Moreover, activation of cAMP signaling enhances LIC loss by retinoic acid, identifying cAMP as another potential APL therapy. Thus, whereas transcriptional activation of PML-RARA is likely to control differentiation, its catabolism triggers LIC eradication and long-term remission of mouse APL. Therapy-triggered degradation of oncoproteins could be a general strategy to eradicate cancer stem cells.",

These miRNAs form a cluster at the chromosomal region 13q14, which is frequently deleted in cancer. Here, we report that the miR-15a and miR-16-1 cluster targets CCND1 (encoding cyclin D1) and WNT3A, which promotes several tumorigenic features such as survival, proliferation and invasion. In cancer cells of advanced prostate tumors, the miR-15a and miR-16 level is significantly decreased, whereas the expression of BCL2, CCND1 and WNT3A is inversely upregulated. Delivery of antagomirs specific for miR-15a and miR-16 to normal mouse prostate results in marked hyperplasia, and knockdown of miR-15a and miR-16 promotes survival, proliferation and invasiveness of untransformed prostate cells, which become tumorigenic in immunodeficient NOD-SCID mice. Conversely, reconstitution of miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression results in growth arrest, apoptosis and marked regression of prostate tumor xenografts. Altogether, we propose that miR-15a and miR-16 act as tumor suppressor genes in prostate cancer through the control of cell survival, proliferation and invasion. These findings have therapeutic implications and may be exploited for future treatment of prostate cancer.",

The CypD-deficient cortical mitochondria are resistant to Abeta- and Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial swelling and permeability transition. Additionally, they have an increased calcium buffering capacity and generate fewer mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the absence of CypD protects neurons from Abeta- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Notably, CypD deficiency substantially improves learning and memory and synaptic function in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and alleviates Abeta-mediated reduction of long-term potentiation. Thus, the CypD-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore is directly linked to the cellular and synaptic perturbations observed in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Blockade of CypD may be a therapeutic strategy in Alzheimer's disease.",

Expression of the intracellular domain of Notch1 (ICN1) was increased in glomerular epithelial cells in diabetic nephropathy and in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Conditional re-expression of ICN1 in vivo exclusively in podocytes caused proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that ICN1 induced apoptosis of podocytes through the activation of p53. Genetic deletion of a Notch transcriptional partner (Rbpj) specifically in podocytes or pharmacological inhibition of the Notch pathway (with a gamma-secretase inhibitor) protected rats with proteinuric kidney diseases. Collectively, our observations suggest that Notch activation in mature podocytes is a new mechanism in the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and thus could represent a new therapeutic target.",

Haploinsufficiency of Tcof1 perturbs mature ribosome biogenesis, resulting in stabilization of p53 and the cyclin G1-mediated cell-cycle arrest that underpins the specificity of neuroepithelial apoptosis and neural crest cell hypoplasia characteristic of TCS. Here we show that inhibition of p53 prevents cyclin G1-driven apoptotic elimination of neural crest cells while rescuing the craniofacial abnormalities associated with mutations in Tcof1 and extending life span. These improvements, however, occur independently of the effects on ribosome biogenesis; thus suggesting that it is p53-dependent neuroepithelial apoptosis that is the primary mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of TCS. Our work further implies that neuroepithelial and neural crest cells are particularly sensitive to cellular stress during embryogenesis and that suppression of p53 function provides an attractive avenue for possible clinical prevention of TCS craniofacial birth defects and possibly those of other neurocristopathies.",

Regulation of osteoclast function is central to the understanding of bone diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteopetrosis. Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) has been shown to inhibit osteoblast differentiation, its role, if any, in osteoclasts is unknown. This is a clinically crucial question because PPAR-gamma agonists, \"such as thiazolidinediones-\" a class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, have been reported to cause a higher rate of fractures in human patients. Here we have uncovered a pro-osteoclastogenic effect of PPAR-gamma by using a Tie2Cre/flox mouse model in which PPAR-gamma is deleted in osteoclasts but not in osteoblasts. These mice develop osteopetrosis characterized by increased bone mass, reduced medullary cavity space and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. These defects are the result of impaired osteoclast differentiation and compromised receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand signaling and can be rescued by bone marrow transplantation. Moreover, ligand activation of PPAR-gamma by rosiglitazone exacerbates osteoclast differentiation in a receptor-dependent manner. Our examination of the underlying mechanisms suggested that PPAR-gamma functions as a direct regulator of c-fos expression, an essential mediator of osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, PPAR-gamma and its ligands have a previously unrecognized role in promoting osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption.",

Here we report that the intestinal bacterial microflora and a functional Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), but not TLR2, are required for hepatic fibrogenesis. Using Tlr4-chimeric mice and in vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, we demonstrate that quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the main precursors for myofibroblasts in the liver, are the predominant target through which TLR4 ligands promote fibrogenesis. In quiescent HSCs, TLR4 activation not only upregulates chemokine secretion and induces chemotaxis of Kupffer cells, but also downregulates the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pseudoreceptor Bambi to sensitize HSCs to TGF-beta-induced signals and allow for unrestricted activation by Kupffer cells. LPS-induced Bambi downregulation and sensitization to TGF-beta is mediated by a MyD88-NF-kappaB-dependent pathway. Accordingly, Myd88-deficient mice have decreased hepatic fibrosis. Thus, modulation of TGF-beta signaling by a TLR4-MyD88-NF-kappaB axis provides a novel link between proinflammatory and profibrogenic signals.",

Genetic inactivation of HACE1 in mice results in the development of spontaneous, late-onset cancer. A second hit from either environmental triggers or genetic heterozygosity of another tumor suppressor, p53, markedly increased tumor incidence in a Hace1-deficient background. Re-expression of HACE1 in human tumor cells directly abrogates in vitro and in vivo tumor growth, whereas downregulation of HACE1 via siRNA allows non-tumorigenic human cells to form tumors in vivo. Mechanistically, the tumor-suppressor function of HACE1 is dependent on its E3 ligase activity and HACE1 controls adhesion-dependent growth and cell cycle progression during cell stress through degradation of cyclin D1. Thus, HACE1 is a candidate chromosome 6q21 tumor-suppressor gene involved in multiple cancers.",

To determine the role of aberrant PI3K-AKT signaling in leiomyosarcoma pathogenesis, we genetically inactivated Pten in the smooth muscle cell lineage by cross-breeding Pten(loxP/loxP) mice with Tagln-cre mice. Mice carrying homozygous deletion of Pten alleles developed widespread smooth muscle cell hyperplasia and abdominal leiomyosarcomas, with a very rapid onset and elevated incidence (approximately 80%) compared to other animal models. Constitutive mTOR activation was restricted to the leiomyosarcomas, revealing the requirement for additional molecular events besides Pten loss. The rapamycin derivative everolimus substantially decelerated tumor growth on Tagln-cre/Pten(loxP/loxP) mice and prolonged their lifespan. Our data show a new and critical role for the AKT-mTOR pathway in smooth muscle transformation and leiomyosarcoma genesis, and support treatment of selected sarcomas by the targeting of this pathway with new compounds or combinations of these with conventional chemotherapy agents.",

The most commonly known AML1-ETO fusion protein (full-length AML1-ETO) from this translocation has 752 amino acids and contains the N-terminal portion of RUNX1 (also known as AML1, CBFalpha2 or PEBP2alphaB), including its DNA binding domain, and almost the entire RUNX1T1 (also known as MTG8 or ETO) protein. Although alterations of gene expression and hematopoietic cell proliferation have been reported in the presence of AML1-ETO, its expression does not lead to the development of leukemia. Here, we report the identification of a previously unknown alternatively spliced isoform of the AML1-ETO transcript, AML1-ETO9a, that includes an extra exon, exon 9a, of the ETO gene. AML1-ETO9a encodes a C-terminally truncated AML1-ETO protein of 575 amino acids. Expression of AML1-ETO9a leads to rapid development of leukemia in a mouse retroviral transduction-transplantation model. More importantly, coexpression of AML1-ETO and AML1-ETO9a results in the substantially earlier onset of AML and blocks myeloid cell differentiation at a more immature stage. These results indicate that fusion proteins from alternatively spliced isoforms of a chromosomal translocation may work together to induce cancer development.",

Reactive astrocytes in Nes-Stat3(-/-) mice showed limited migration and resulted in markedly widespread infiltration of inflammatory cells, neural disruption and demyelination with severe motor deficits after contusive spinal cord injury (SCI). On the contrary, we observed rapid migration of reactive astrocytes to seclude inflammatory cells, enhanced contraction of lesion area and notable improvement in functional recovery in Nes-Socs3(-/-) mice. These results suggest that Stat3 is a key regulator of reactive astrocytes in the healing process after SCI, providing a potential target for intervention in the treatment of CNS injury.",

So far, its function in the brain is largely unknown. Here, we show that IKK is activated in a mouse model of stroke. To investigate the function of IKK in brain ischemia we generated mice that contain a targeted deletion of Ikbkb (which encodes IKK2) in mouse neurons and mice that express a dominant inhibitor of IKK in neurons. In both lines, inhibition of IKK activity markedly reduced infarct size. In contrast, constitutive activation of IKK2 enlarged the infarct size. A selective small-molecule inhibitor of IKK mimicked the effect of genetic IKK inhibition in neurons, reducing the infarct volume and cell death in a therapeutic time window of 4.5 h. These data indicate a key function of IKK in ischemic brain damage and suggest a potential role for IKK inhibitors in stroke therapy.",

The extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan is produced after tissue injury and impaired clearance results in unremitting inflammation. Here we report that hyaluronan degradation products require MyD88 and both Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 and TLR2 in vitro and in vivo to initiate inflammatory responses in acute lung injury. Hyaluronan fragments isolated from serum of individuals with acute lung injury stimulated macrophage chemokine production in a TLR4- and TLR2-dependent manner. Myd88(-/-) and Tlr4(-/-)Tlr2(-/-) mice showed impaired transepithelial migration of inflammatory cells but decreased survival and enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis after lung injury. Lung epithelial cell-specific overexpression of high-molecular-mass hyaluronan was protective against acute lung injury. Furthermore, epithelial cell-surface hyaluronan was protective against apoptosis, in part, through TLR-dependent basal activation of NF-kappaB. Hyaluronan-TLR2 and hyaluronan-TLR4 interactions provide signals that initiate inflammatory responses, maintain epithelial cell integrity and promote recovery from acute lung injury.",

        "TEXT": "Immunosuppressants are crucial in the prevention of detrimental immune reactions associated with allogenic organ transplantation, but they often cause adverse effects in a number of biological systems, including the skeletal system. Calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A inhibit nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity and induce strong immunosuppression. Among NFAT proteins, NFATc1 is crucial for the differentiation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Here we show FK506 administration induces the reduction of bone mass despite a blockade of osteoclast differentiation. This reduction is caused by severe impairment of bone formation, suggesting that NFAT transcription factors also have an important role in the transcriptional program of osteoblasts. In fact, bone formation is inhibited in Nfatc1- and Nfatc2-deficient cells as well as in FK506-treated osteoblasts. Overexpression of NFATc1 stimulates Osterix-dependent activation of the Col1a1 (encoding type I collagen) promoter, but not Runx2-dependent activation of the Bglap1 (encoding osteocalcin) promoter. NFAT and Osterix form a complex that binds to DNA, and this interaction is important for the transcriptional activity of Osterix. Thus, NFAT and Osterix cooperatively control osteoblastic bone formation. These results may provide important insight into the management of post-transplantation osteoporosis as well as a new strategy for promoting bone regeneration in osteopenic disease.",

We found that HOX genes, which normally regulate mullerian duct differentiation, are not expressed in normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE), but are expressed in different EOC subtypes according to the pattern of mullerian-like differentiation of these cancers. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 in tumorigenic mouse OSE cells gave rise to papillary tumors resembling serous EOCs. In contrast, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 induced morphogenesis of endometrioid-like and mucinous-like EOCs, respectively. Hoxa7 showed no lineage specificity, but promoted the abilities of Hoxa9, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 to induce differentiation along their respective pathways. Therefore, inappropriate activation of a molecular program that controls patterning of the reproductive tract could explain the morphologic heterogeneity of EOCs and their assumption of müllerian-like features.",

More recently, atherosclerotic lesion progression has been shown to depend on persistent, chronic inflammation in the artery wall. Although several studies have implicated infectious agents in this process, the role of infection in atherosclerosis remains controversial. Because the involvement of monocytes and macrophages in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is well established, we investigated the possibility that macrophage innate immunity signaling pathways normally activated by pathogens might also be activated in response to hyperlipidemia. We examined atherosclerotic lesion development in uninfected, hyperlipidemic mice lacking expression of either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor CD14 or myeloid differentiation protein-88 (MyD88), which transduces cell signaling events downstream of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), as well as receptors for interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-18. Whereas the MyD88-deficient mice evinced a marked reduction in early atherosclerosis, mice deficient in CD14 had no decrease in early lesion development. Inactivation of the MyD88 pathway led to a reduction in atherosclerosis through a decrease in macrophage recruitment to the artery wall that was associated with reduced chemokine levels. These findings link elevated serum lipid levels to a proinflammatory signaling cascade that is also engaged by microbial pathogens.",

Platelet activators such as adenosine diphosphate, thrombin or thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) activate receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins. Activation of platelets through these receptors involves signaling through G(q), G(i) and G(z) (refs. 4-6). However, the role and relative importance of G(12) and G(13), which are activated by various platelet stimuli, are unclear. Here we show that lack of Galpha(13), but not Galpha(12), severely reduced the potency of thrombin, TXA(2) and collagen to induce platelet shape changes and aggregation in vitro. These defects were accompanied by reduced activation of RhoA and inability to form stable platelet thrombi under high shear stress ex vivo. Galpha(13) deficiency in platelets resulted in a severe defect in primary hemostasis and complete protection against arterial thrombosis in vivo. We conclude that G(13)-mediated signaling processes are required for normal hemostasis and thrombosis and may serve as a new target for antiplatelet drugs.",

We show that the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) induces GRK2 and GRK5 expression in PMNs through phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-gamma signaling. We also show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated signaling through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 pathway transcriptionally downregulates the expression of GRK2 and GRK5 in response to MIP-2. The reduced expression of GRKs lowers chemokine receptor desensitization and markedly augments the PMN migratory response.

Fas-mediated apoptosis is implicated in a broad spectrum of liver diseases, where inhibiting hepatocyte death is life-saving. We investigated the in vivo silencing effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes targeting the gene Fas (also known as Tnfrsf6), encoding the Fas receptor, to protect mice from liver failure and fibrosis in two models of autoimmune hepatitis. Intravenous injection of Fas siRNA specifically reduced Fas mRNA levels and expression of Fas protein in mouse hepatocytes, and the effects persisted without diminution for 10 days. Hepatocytes isolated from mice treated with Fas siRNA were resistant to apoptosis when exposed to Fas-specific antibody or co-cultured with concanavalin A (ConA)-stimulated hepatic mononuclear cells. Treatment with Fas siRNA 2 days before ConA challenge abrogated hepatocyte necrosis and inflammatory infiltration and markedly reduced serum concentrations of transaminases. Administering Fas siRNA beginning one week after initiating weekly ConA injections protected mice from liver fibrosis. In a more fulminant hepatitis induced by injecting agonistic Fas-specific antibody, 82% of mice treated with siRNA that effectively silenced Fas survived for 10 days of observation, whereas all control mice died within 3 days. Silencing Fas expression with RNAi holds therapeutic promise to prevent liver injury by protecting hepatocytes from cytotoxicity.",

Expression of a cytosolic active form of Smac or cell-permeable Smac peptides bypassed the Bcl-2 block, which prevented the release of Smac from mitochondria, and also sensitized resistant neuroblastoma or melanoma cells and patient-derived primary neuroblastoma cells ex vivo. Most importantly, Smac peptides strongly enhanced the antitumor activity of Apo-2L/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in an intracranial malignant glioma xenograft model in vivo. Complete eradication of established tumors and survival of mice was only achieved upon combined treatment with Smac peptides and Apo2L/TRAIL without detectable toxicity to normal brain tissue. Thus, Smac agonists are promising candidates for cancer therapy by potentiating cytotoxic therapies.",

In a mouse model of lethal hepatitis induced by TNF, apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes, but also lethality, hypothermia and influx of leukocytes into the liver, are prevented by a broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, BB-94. Mice deficient in MMP-2, MMP-3 or MMP-9 had lower levels of apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes, and better survival. We found induction of MMP-9 activity and fibronectin degradation. Our findings suggest that several MMPs play a critical role in acute, fulminant hepatitis by degrading the extracellular matrix and allowing massive leukocyte influx in the liver. BB-94 also prevented lethality in TNF/interferon-gamma therapy in tumor-bearing mice. A broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor may be potentially useful for the treatment of patients with acute and perhaps chronic liver failure, and in cancer therapies using inflammatory cytokines.",

Here we have assessed the effect of Egr1 deficiency on tumor development in two transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer (CR2-T-Ag and TRAMP). Using a combination of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and histopathological and survival analyses, we show that tumor progression was significantly impaired in Egr1-/- mice. Tumor initiation and tumor growth rate were not affected by the lack of Egr1; however, Egr1 deficiency significantly delayed the progression from prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma.

PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma are both expressed in human macrophages where they exert anti-inflammatory effects. The activation of PPAR-alpha may promote foam-cell formation by inducing expression of the macrophage scavenger receptor CD36. This prompted us to investigate the influence of different PPAR-activators on cholesterol metabolism and foam-cell formation of human primary and THP-1 macrophages. Here we show that PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma activators do not influence acetylated low density lipoprotein-induced foam-cell formation of human macrophages. In contrast, PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma activators induce the expression of the gene encoding ABCA1, a transporter that controls apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages. These effects are likely due to enhanced expression of liver-x-receptor alpha, an oxysterol-activated nuclear receptor which induces ABCA1-promoter transcription. Moreover, PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma activators increase apoAI-induced cholesterol efflux from normal macrophages. In contrast, PPAR-alpha or PPAR-gamma activation does not influence cholesterol efflux from macrophages isolated from patients with Tangier disease, which is due to a genetic defect in ABCA1. Here we identify a regulatory role for PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma in the first steps of the reverse-cholesterol-transport pathway through the activation of ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux in human macrophages.",

Ex vivo, oocytes lacking the gene for acid sphingomyelinase or wild-type oocytes treated with sphingosine-1-phosphate resisted developmental apoptosis and apoptosis induced by anti-cancer therapy, confirming cell autonomy of the death defect. Moreover, radiation-induced oocyte loss in adult wild-type female mice, the event that drives premature ovarian failure and infertility in female cancer patients, was completely prevented by in vivo therapy with sphingosine-1-phosphate.

It is believed to originate from the undifferentiated external granule layer cells in the cerebellum, but the mechanism of tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here we studied three types of human medulloblastoma cells that express markers corresponding to different levels of neuronal differentiation. They expressed the neuronal repressor element 1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF; refs. 7-10) at very high levels compared with either neuronal progenitor NTera2 (NT2) cells or fully differentiated human neuron teratocarcinoma (hNT cells). To counter the effect of REST/NRSF, we used a recombinant transcription factor, REST-VP16, constructed by replacing repressor domains of REST/NRSF with the activation domain of viral protein (VP16). Transient expression of REST-VP16 in medulloblastoma cells was able to compete with the endogenous REST/NRSF for DNA binding and stimulate neuronal promoters. High-efficiency expression of REST-VP16 mediated by adenovirus vectors (Ad.REST-VP16) in medulloblastoma cells was able to counter REST/NRSF-mediated repression of neuronal promoters, stimulate expression of endogenous neuronal genes and trigger apoptosis through the activation of caspase cascades. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of Ad.REST-VP16 in established medulloblastoma tumors in nude mice inhibited their growth. Therefore, REST/NRSF may serve as a new target for therapeutic interventions for medulloblastoma through agents such as REST-VP16.",

A neutralizing antibody against IL-6R suppressed established experimental colitis in various animal models of CD mediated by type 1 T-helper cells, by inducing apoptosis of lamina propria T cells. Similarly, specific neutralization of sIL-6R in vivo by a newly designed gp130-Fc fusion protein caused suppression of colitis activity and induction of apoptosis, indicating that sIL-6R prevents mucosal T-cell apoptosis. In patients with CD, mucosal T cells showed strong evidence for IL-6 trans signaling, with activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, bcl-2 and bcl-xl. Blockade of IL-6 trans signaling caused T-cell apoptosis, indicating that the IL-6-sIL-6R system mediates the resistance of T cells to apoptosis in CD. These data indicate that a pathway of T-cell activation driven by IL-6-sIL-6R contributes to the perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation. Specific targeting of this pathway may be a promising new approach for the treatment of CD.",

Here, we report that the gene for caspase 8 is frequently inactivated in neuroblastoma, a childhood tumor of the peripheral nervous system. The gene is silenced through DNA methylation as well as through gene deletion. Complete inactivation of CASP8 occurred almost exclusively in neuroblastomas with amplification of the oncogene MYCN. Caspase 8-null neuroblastoma cells were resistant to death receptor- and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis, deficits that were corrected by programmed expression of the enzyme. Thus, caspase 8 acts as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastomas with amplification of MYCN.",

Amounts of MGAT5 glycan products are commonly increased in malignancies, and correlate with disease progression. To study the functions of these N-glycans in development and disease, we generated mice deficient in Mgat5 by targeted gene mutation. These Mgat5-/- mice lacked Mgat5 products and appeared normal, but differed in their responses to certain extrinsic conditions. Mammary tumor growth and metastases induced by the polyomavirus middle T oncogene was considerably less in Mgat5-/- mice than in transgenic littermates expressing Mgat5. Furthermore, Mgat5 glycan products stimulated membrane ruffling and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B activation, fueling a positive feedback loop that amplified oncogene signaling and tumor growth in vivo. Our results indicate that inhibitors of MGAT5 might be useful in the treatment of malignancies by targeting their dependency on focal adhesion signaling for growth and metastasis.",

However, this molecule is ineffective in other AML subtypes. The CD44 surface antigen, on leukemic blasts from most AML patients, is involved in myeloid differentiation. Here, we report that ligation of CD44 with specific anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies or with hyaluronan, its natural ligand, can reverse myeloid differentiation blockage in AML1/2 to AML5 subtypes. The differentiation of AML blasts was evidenced by the ability to produce oxidative bursts, the expression of lineage antigens and cytological modifications, all specific to normal differentiated myeloid cells.

In a murine model, Fas (CD95)-deficient (Ipr) and FasL-defective (gld) mice had a significantly increased incidence of neovascularization compared with normal mice. Furthermore, in gld mice there is massive subretinal neovascularization with uncontrolled growth of vessels. We found that cultured choroidal endothelial cells were induced to undergo apoptosis by retinal pigment epithelial cells through a Fas-FasL interaction. In addition, antibody against Fas prevented vascular tube formation of choroidal endothelial cells derived from the eye in a three-dimensional in vitro assay.

The small GTPase Rho controls cell adhesion and motility through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and regulation of actomyosin contractility. Cultured rat MM1 hepatoma cells migrate through a mesothelial cell monolayer in vitro in a serum-dependent, Rho-mediated manners. Among several proteins isolated as putative target molecules of Rho, the ROCK (ROK) family of Rho-associated serine-threonine protein kinases are thought to participate in the induction of focal adhesions and stress fibers in cultured cells, and to mediate calcium sensitization of smooth muscle contraction by enhancing phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin. Transfection of MM1 cells with cDNA encoding a dominant active mutant of ROCK conferred invasive activity independently of serum and Rho. In contrast, expression of a dominant negative, kinase-defective ROCK mutant substantially attenuated the invasive phenotype. A specific ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) blocked both Rho-mediated activation of actomyosin and invasive activity of these cells. Furthermore, continuous delivery of this inhibitor using osmotic pumps considerably reduced the dissemination of MM1 cells implanted into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic rats. These results indicate that ROCK plays an essential part in tumor cell invasion, and demonstrate its potential as a therapeutic target for the prevention of cancer invasion and metastasis.",

Par-4 is expressed in the nervous system, where its function is unknown. In Alzheimer disease (AD), neurons may die by apoptosis, and amyloid beta-protein (A beta) may play a role in this. We report here that Par-4 expression is increased in vulnerable neurons in AD brain and is induced in cultured neurons undergoing apoptosis. Blockade of Par-4 expression or function prevented neuronal apoptosis induced by Ab and trophic factor withdrawal.

We cloned two major splicing variants of the latter gene and named these p51A and p51B (a human homologue of rat Ket). The p51A gene encodes a 448-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 50.9 kDa; and p51B, a 641-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 71.9 kDa. In contrast with the ubiquitous expression of p53, expression of p51 mRNA was found in a limited number of tissues, including skeletal muscle, placenta, mammary gland, prostate, trachea, thymus, salivary gland, uterus, heart and lung. In p53-deficient cells, p51A induced growth-suppression and apoptosis, and upregulated p21waf-1 through p53 regulatory elements. Mutations in p51 were found in some human epidermal tumors.",

Cloning the full-length TSIP 2 cDNA showed that it corresponds to the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene, in which mutations have been reported in early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Here we demonstrate that PS1 is downregulated in a series of model systems for p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis and tumor suppression. To investigate the biological relevance of this downregulation, we stably transfected U937 cells with antisense PS1 cDNA. The downregulation of PS1 in these U937 transfectants results in reduced growth with an increased fraction of the cells in apoptosis. When injected into mice homozygous for severe combined immunodeficiency disease (scid/scid mice), these cells show a suppression of their malignant phenotype. Our results indicate that PS1, initially identified in a neurodegenerative disease, may also be involved in the regulation of cancer-related pathways.",

In contrast, a syngeneic colorectal tumor line, CMT93, killed predominantly by apoptosis, showed low levels of hsp expression and less immunogenicity. When apoptosis was inhibited in CMT93 cells by overexpression of bcl-2, hsp was also induced. Furthermore, when cDNA encoding hsp70 was stably transfected into B16 and CMT93 cells, its expression significantly enhanced the immunogenicity of both tumors.

Apoptosis induced by DXR in oocytes is blocked by sphingosine-1-phosphate, an inhibitor of ceramide-promoted cell death. Oocytes from Bax-deficient, but not p53-null, female mice display complete resistance to DXR-induced apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.

To overcome these problems for one such protein, we constructed retroviral and adenoviral vectors that express a novel, secretable form of the antiangiogenic protein, platelet factor 4 (sPF4). Vector-mediated sPF4 transduction selectively inhibits endothelial cell proliferation in vitro, and results in hypovascular tumors that grow slowly in vivo. Additionally, tumor-associated angiogenesis is inhibited and animal survival is prolonged, following transduction of established intracerebral gliomas by an sPF4-expressing adenoviral vector. These data support the concept that targeted antiangiogenesis, using virally mediated gene transfer, represents a promising strategy for delivering antiangiogenic therapy.",

In MMTV-v-Ha-ras mice bearing palpable tumours, daily administration of L-744,832 caused tumour regression. Following cessation of treatment, tumours reappeared, the majority of which regressed upon retreatment. No systemic toxicity was found upon necropsy of L-744,832-treated mice.

Here we characterize autoantibodies to lysosomal membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) and show that they are a new ANCA subtype present in almost all individuals with FNGN. Consequently, its prevalence is nearly twice that of the classical ANCAs that recognize myeloperoxidase or proteinase-3. Furthermore, antibodies to LAMP-2 cause pauci-immune FNGN when injected into rats, and a monoclonal antibody to human LAMP-2 (H4B4) induces apoptosis of human microvascular endothelium in vitro. The autoantibodies in individuals with pauci-immune FNGN commonly recognize a human LAMP-2 epitope (designated P(41-49)) with 100% homology to the bacterial adhesin FimH, with which they cross-react. Rats immunized with FimH develop pauci-immune FNGN and also develop antibodies to rat and human LAMP-2. Finally, we show that infections with fimbriated pathogens are common before the onset of FNGN. Thus, FimH-triggered autoimmunity to LAMP-2 provides a previously undescribed clinically relevant molecular mechanism for the development of pauci-immune FNGN.",

Adiponectin is a circulating adipose-derived cytokine that is downregulated in obese individuals and after myocardial infarction. Here, we examine the role of adiponectin in myocardial remodeling in response to acute injury. Ischemia-reperfusion in adiponectin-deficient (APN-KO) mice resulted in increased myocardial infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha expression compared with wild-type mice. Administration of adiponectin diminished infarct size, apoptosis and TNF-alpha production in both APN-KO and wild-type mice. In cultured cardiac cells, adiponectin inhibited apoptosis and TNF-alpha production. Dominant negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) reversed the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on apoptosis but had no effect on the suppressive effect of adiponectin on TNF-alpha production. Adiponectin induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-dependent synthesis of prostaglandin E(2) in cardiac cells, and COX-2 inhibition reversed the inhibitory effects of adiponectin on TNF-alpha production and infarct size. These data suggest that adiponectin protects the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury through both AMPK- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.",

Here we report that, in a reversal of their effect on Alzheimer's disease, the APOE4 and APOE2 variants confer favorable and poor outcomes in melanoma, respectively. Mice expressing the human APOE4 allele exhibited reduced melanoma progression and metastasis relative to APOE2 mice. APOE4 mice exhibited enhanced anti-tumor immune activation relative to APOE2 mice, and T cell depletion experiments showed that the effect of APOE genotype on melanoma progression was mediated by altered anti-tumor immunity. Consistently, patients with melanoma carrying the APOE4 variant experienced improved survival in comparison to carriers of APOE2. Notably, APOE4 mice also showed improved outcomes under PD1 immune checkpoint blockade relative to APOE2 mice, and patients carrying APOE4 experienced improved anti-PD1 immunotherapy survival after progression on frontline regimens. Finally, enhancing APOE expression via pharmacologic activation of liver X receptors, previously shown to boost anti-tumor immunity4, exhibited therapeutic efficacy in APOE4 mice but not in APOE2 mice. These findings demonstrate that pre-existing hereditary genetics can impact progression and survival outcomes of a future malignancy and warrant prospective investigation of APOE genotype as a biomarker for melanoma outcome and therapeutic response.",

Using TMEM30A-knockout systems, increased accumulation of chemotherapy drugs was observed in TMEM30A-knockout cell lines and TMEM30A-mutated primary cells, explaining the improved treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found increased tumor-associated macrophages and an enhanced effect of anti-CD47 blockade limiting tumor growth in TMEM30A-knockout models. By contrast, we show that TMEM30A loss-of-function increases B-cell signaling following antigen stimulation-a mechanism conferring selective advantage during B-cell lymphoma development.

KMT2C (hereafter referred to as MLL3) frequently incurs point mutations across a range of human tumor types, but precisely how these lesions alter MLL3 function and contribute to oncogenesis is unclear. Here we report a cancer mutational hotspot in MLL3 within the region encoding its plant homeodomain (PHD) repeats and demonstrate that this domain mediates association of MLL3 with the histone H2A deubiquitinase and tumor suppressor BAP1. Cancer-associated mutations in the sequence encoding the MLL3 PHD repeats disrupt the interaction between MLL3 and BAP1 and correlate with poor patient survival. Cancer cells that had PHD-associated MLL3 mutations or lacked BAP1 showed reduced recruitment of MLL3 and the H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) to gene enhancers. As a result, inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in tumor cells harboring BAP1 or MLL3 mutations restored normal gene expression patterns and impaired cell proliferation in vivo. This study provides mechanistic insight into the oncogenic effects of PHD-associated mutations in MLL3 and suggests that restoration of a balanced state of Polycomb-COMPASS activity may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors that bear mutations in the genes encoding these epigenetic factors.",

These cells persist in the bone marrow (BM) despite effective inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Here we show that although the microRNA (miRNA) miR-126 supported the quiescence, self-renewal and engraftment capacity of CML LSCs, miR-126 levels were lower in CML LSCs than in long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from healthy individuals. Downregulation of miR-126 levels in CML LSCs was due to phosphorylation of Sprouty-related EVH1-domain-containing 1 (SPRED1) by BCR-ABL, which led to inhibition of the RAN-exportin-5-RCC1 complex that mediates miRNA maturation. Endothelial cells (ECs) in the BM supply miR-126 to CML LSCs to support quiescence and leukemia growth, as shown using mouse models of CML in which Mir126a (encoding miR-126) was conditionally knocked out in ECs and/or LSCs. Inhibition of BCR-ABL by TKI treatment caused an undesired increase in endogenous miR-126 levels, which enhanced LSC quiescence and persistence. Mir126a knockout in LSCs and/or ECs, or treatment with a miR-126 inhibitor that targets miR-126 expression in both LSCs and ECs, enhanced the in vivo anti-leukemic effects of TKI treatment and strongly diminished LSC leukemia-initiating capacity, providing a new strategy for the elimination of LSCs in individuals with CML.",

Herein we report the preclinical development of V-9302, a competitive small molecule antagonist of transmembrane glutamine flux that selectively and potently targets the amino acid transporter ASCT2. Pharmacological blockade of ASCT2 with V-9302 resulted in attenuated cancer cell growth and proliferation, increased cell death, and increased oxidative stress, which collectively contributed to antitumor responses in vitro and in vivo.

BET proteins enhance the oncogenic functions of major cancer drivers by elevating the expression of these drivers, such as c-Myc in leukemia, or by promoting the transcriptional activities of oncogenic factors, such as AR and ERG in prostate cancer. Pathologically, BET proteins are frequently overexpressed and are clinically linked to various types of human cancer; they are therefore being pursued as attractive therapeutic targets for selective inhibition in patients with cancer. To this end, a number of bromodomain inhibitors, including JQ1 and I-BET, have been developed and have shown promising outcomes in early clinical trials. Although resistance to BET inhibitors has been documented in preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance are largely unknown. Here we report that cullin-3SPOP earmarks BET proteins, including BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, for ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Pathologically, prostate cancer-associated SPOP mutants fail to interact with and promote the degradation of BET proteins, leading to their elevated abundance in SPOP-mutant prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer cell lines and organoids derived from individuals harboring SPOP mutations are more resistant to BET-inhibitor-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, our results elucidate the tumor-suppressor role of SPOP in prostate cancer in which it acts as a negative regulator of BET protein stability and also provide a molecular mechanism for resistance to BET inhibitors in individuals with prostate cancer bearing SPOP mutations.",

While the cytokine and cellular pathways triggering arthritis are well defined, those responsible for the resolution of inflammation are incompletely characterized. Here we identified interleukin (IL)-9-producing type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as the mediators of a molecular and cellular pathway that orchestrates the resolution of chronic inflammation. In mice, the absence of IL-9 impaired ILC2 proliferation and activation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resulted in chronic arthritis with excessive cartilage destruction and bone loss. In contrast, treatment with IL-9 promoted ILC2-dependent Treg activation and effectively induced resolution of inflammation and protection of bone. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis in remission exhibited high numbers of IL-9+ ILC2s in joints and the circulation. Hence, fostering IL-9-mediated ILC2 activation may offer a novel therapeutic approach inducing resolution of inflammation rather than suppression of inflammatory responses.",

Here we show that deletion of the pro-apoptotic genes Bak and Bax in osterix (Osx, also known as Sp7 transcription factor 7)-expressing cells in mice promotes HSC regeneration and hematopoietic radioprotection following total body irradiation. These mice showed increased bone marrow (BM) levels of the protein dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which was produced in Osx-expressing BM cells. Treatment of irradiated HSCs with Dkk1 in vitro increased the recovery of both long-term repopulating HSCs and progenitor cells, and systemic administration of Dkk1 to irradiated mice increased hematopoietic recovery and improved survival. Conversely, inducible deletion of one allele of Dkk1 in Osx-expressing cells in adult mice inhibited the recovery of BM stem and progenitor cells and of complete blood counts following irradiation. Dkk1 promoted hematopoietic regeneration via both direct effects on HSCs, in which treatment with Dkk1 decreased the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and suppressed senescence, and indirect effects on BM endothelial cells, in which treatment with Dkk1 induced epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion. Accordingly, blockade of the EGF receptor partially abrogated Dkk1-mediated hematopoietic recovery. These data identify Dkk1 as a regulator of hematopoietic regeneration and demonstrate paracrine cross-talk between BM osteolineage cells and endothelial cells in regulating hematopoietic reconstitution following injury.",

We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in RNF43-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, which rely on Wnt signaling for proliferation. Through these screens, we discovered a unique requirement for a Wnt signaling circuit: engaging FZD5, one of the ten Frizzled receptors encoded in the human genome. Our results uncover an underappreciated level of context-dependent specificity at the Wnt receptor level. We further derived a panel of recombinant antibodies that reports the expression of nine FZD proteins and confirms that FZD5 functional specificity cannot be explained by protein expression patterns. Additionally, antibodies that specifically bind FZD5 and FZD8 robustly inhibited the growth of RNF43-mutant PDAC cells grown in vitro and as xenografts in vivo, providing orthogonal support for the functional specificity observed genetically. Proliferation of a patient-derived PDAC cell line harboring an RNF43 variant was also selectively inhibited by the FZD5 antibodies, further demonstrating their use as a potential targeted therapy. Tumor organoid cultures from colorectal carcinoma patients that carried RNF43 mutations were also sensitive to the FZD5 antibodies, highlighting the potential generalizability of these findings beyond PDAC. Our results show that CRIPSR-based genetic screens can be leveraged to identify and validate cell surface targets for antibody development and therapy.",

Improper regeneration of the alveolar epithelium is often associated with severe pulmonary fibrosis, the latter of which involves the recruitment and activation of fibroblasts, as well as matrix accumulation. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) are stem cells in the adult lung that contribute to the lung repair process. The mechanisms that regulate AEC2 renewal are incompletely understood. We provide evidence that expression of the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) on AEC2s are important for AEC2 renewal, repair of lung injury and limiting the extent of fibrosis. Either deletion of TLR4 or HA synthase 2 in surfactant-protein-C-positive AEC2s leads to impaired renewal capacity, severe fibrosis and mortality. Furthermore, AEC2s from patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis have reduced cell surface HA and impaired renewal capacity, suggesting that HA and TLR4 are key contributors to lung stem cell renewal and that severe pulmonary fibrosis is the result of distal epithelial stem cell failure.",

The identification of an effective prevention therapy therefore remains a 'holy grail' for the field. Precancerous BRCA1(mut/+) tissue harbors an aberrant population of luminal progenitor cells, and deregulated progesterone signaling has been implicated in BRCA1-associated oncogenesis. Coupled with the findings that tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11; also known as RANKL) is a key paracrine effector of progesterone signaling and that RANKL and its receptor TNFRSF11A (also known as RANK) contribute to mammary tumorigenesis, we investigated a role for this pathway in the pre-neoplastic phase of BRCA1-mutation carriers. We identified two subsets of luminal progenitors (RANK(+) and RANK(-)) in histologically normal tissue of BRCA1-mutation carriers and showed that RANK(+) cells are highly proliferative, have grossly aberrant DNA repair and bear a molecular signature similar to that of basal-like breast cancer. These data suggest that RANK(+) and not RANK(-) progenitors are a key target population in these women. Inhibition of RANKL signaling by treatment with denosumab in three-dimensional breast organoids derived from pre-neoplastic BRCA1(mut/+) tissue attenuated progesterone-induced proliferation. Notably, proliferation was markedly reduced in breast biopsies from BRCA1-mutation carriers who were treated with denosumab. Furthermore, inhibition of RANKL in a Brca1-deficient mouse model substantially curtailed mammary tumorigenesis. Taken together, these findings identify a targetable pathway in a putative cell-of-origin population in BRCA1-mutation carriers and implicate RANKL blockade as a promising strategy in the prevention of breast cancer.",

        "TEXT": "MYC oncoproteins are involved in the genesis and maintenance of the majority of human tumors but are considered undruggable. By using a direct in vivo shRNA screen, we show that liver cancer cells that have mutations in the gene encoding the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Trp53 in mice and TP53 in humans) and that are driven by the oncoprotein NRAS become addicted to MYC stabilization via a mechanism mediated by aurora kinase A (AURKA). This MYC stabilization enables the tumor cells to overcome a latent G2/M cell cycle arrest that is mediated by AURKA and the tumor suppressor protein p19(ARF). MYC directly binds to AURKA, and inhibition of this protein-protein interaction by conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors results in subsequent MYC degradation and cell death. These conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, with one of them currently being tested in early clinical trials, suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival in mice bearing Trp53-deficient, NRAS-driven MYC-expressing hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). TP53-mutated human HCCs revealed increased AURKA expression and a positive correlation between AURKA and MYC expression. In xenograft models, mice bearing TP53-mutated or TP53-deleted human HCCs were hypersensitive to treatment with conformation-changing AURKA inhibitors, thus suggesting a therapeutic strategy for this subgroup of human HCCs.",

However, the determinants of AR overexpression in CRPC are poorly defined. Here we show that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) is overexpressed and amplified in metastatic CRPC tumors, and that ROR-γ drives AR expression in the tumors. ROR-γ recruits nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (NCOA1 and NCOA3, also known as SRC-1 and SRC-3) to an AR-ROR response element (RORE) to stimulate AR gene transcription. ROR-γ antagonists suppress the expression of both AR and its variant AR-V7 in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines and tumors. ROR-γ antagonists also markedly diminish genome-wide AR binding, H3K27ac abundance and expression of the AR target gene network. Finally, ROR-γ antagonists suppressed tumor growth in multiple AR-expressing, but not AR-negative, xenograft PCa models, and they effectively sensitized CRPC tumors to enzalutamide, without overt toxicity, in mice. Taken together, these results establish ROR-γ as a key player in CRPC by acting upstream of AR and as a potential therapeutic target for advanced PCa.",

We and others have shown that MYC alters metabolism during tumorigenesis. However, the role of MYC in TNBC metabolism remains mostly unexplored. We hypothesized that MYC-dependent metabolic dysregulation is essential for the growth of MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells and may identify new therapeutic targets for this clinically challenging subset of breast cancer. Using a targeted metabolomics approach, we identified fatty acid oxidation (FAO) intermediates as being dramatically upregulated in a MYC-driven model of TNBC. We also identified a lipid metabolism gene signature in patients with TNBC that were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and from multiple other clinical data sets, implicating FAO as a dysregulated pathway that is critical for TNBC cell metabolism. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of FAO catastrophically decreased energy metabolism in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells and blocked tumor growth in a MYC-driven transgenic TNBC model and in a MYC-overexpressing TNBC patient-derived xenograft. These findings demonstrate that MYC-overexpressing TNBC shows an increased bioenergetic reliance on FAO and identify the inhibition of FAO as a potential therapeutic strategy for this subset of breast cancer.",

We generated mice with conditional inactivation of Rps14 and demonstrated an erythroid differentiation defect that is dependent on the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) and is characterized by apoptosis at the transition from polychromatic to orthochromatic erythroblasts. This defect resulted in age-dependent progressive anemia, megakaryocyte dysplasia and loss of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence. As assessed by quantitative proteomics, mutant erythroblasts expressed higher levels of proteins involved in innate immune signaling, notably the heterodimeric S100 calcium-binding proteins S100a8 and S100a9. S100a8--whose expression was increased in mutant erythroblasts, monocytes and macrophages--is functionally involved in the erythroid defect caused by the Rps14 deletion, as addition of recombinant S100a8 was sufficient to induce a differentiation defect in wild-type erythroid cells, and genetic inactivation of S100a8 expression rescued the erythroid differentiation defect of Rps14-haploinsufficient HSCs. Our data link Rps14 haploinsufficiency in del(5q) MDS to activation of the innate immune system and induction of S100A8-S100A9 expression, leading to a p53-dependent erythroid differentiation defect.",

Although loss or near-complete loss of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice, a similar degree of PU.1 impairment is exceedingly rare in human AML; yet, moderate PU.1 inhibition is common in AML patients. We assessed functional consequences of modest reductions in PU.1 expression on leukemia development in mice harboring DNA lesions resembling those acquired during human stem cell aging. Heterozygous deletion of an enhancer of PU.1, which resulted in a 35% reduction of PU.1 expression, was sufficient to induce myeloid-biased preleukemic stem cells and their subsequent transformation to AML in a DNA mismatch repair-deficient background. AML progression was mediated by inhibition of expression of a PU.1-cooperating transcription factor, Irf8. Notably, we found marked molecular similarities between the disease in these mice and human myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. This study demonstrates that minimal reduction of a key lineage-specific transcription factor, which commonly occurs in human disease, is sufficient to initiate cancer development, and it provides mechanistic insight into the formation and progression of preleukemic stem cells in AML.",

Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing (read depth, 412-668×) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing (100-347,499×) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that brain somatic activating mutations in MTOR cause FCD and identifies mTOR as a treatment target for intractable epilepsy in FCD.",

        "TEXT": "Detection of cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), a bacterial second messenger, by the host cytoplasmic surveillance pathway (CSP) is known to elicit type I interferon (IFN) responses, which are crucial to antimicrobial defense. However, the mechanisms and role of c-di-AMP signaling in Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence remain unclear. Here we show that resistance to tuberculosis requires CSP-mediated detection of c-di-AMP produced by M. tuberculosis and that levels of c-di-AMP modulate the fate of infection. We found that a di-adenylate cyclase (disA or dacA)-overexpressing M. tuberculosis strain that secretes excess c-di-AMP activates the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) pathway with enhanced levels of IFN-β, elicits increased macrophage autophagy, and exhibits substantial virulence attenuation in mice. We show that c-di-AMP-mediated IFN-β induction during M. tuberculosis infection requires stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-signaling. We observed that c-di-AMP induction of IFN-β is independent of the cytosolic nucleic acid receptor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), but cGAS nevertheless contributes substantially to the overall IFN-β response to M. tuberculosis infection. In sum, our results reveal c-di-AMP to be a key mycobacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) driving host type I IFN responses and autophagy. These findings suggest that modulating the levels of this small molecule may lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies against tuberculosis.",

We performed genome-wide transcriptome studies of a large cohort (n = 95) of normal and fibrotic human kidney tubule samples followed by systems and network analyses and identified inflammation and metabolism as the top dysregulated pathways in the diseased kidneys. In particular, we found that humans and mouse models with tubulointerstitial fibrosis had lower expression of key enzymes and regulators of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and higher intracellular lipid deposition compared to controls. In vitro experiments indicated that inhibition of FAO in tubule epithelial cells caused ATP depletion, cell death, dedifferentiation and intracellular lipid deposition, phenotypes observed in fibrosis. In contrast, restoring fatty acid metabolism by genetic or pharmacological methods protected mice from tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Our results raise the possibility that correcting the metabolic defect in FAO may be useful for preventing and treating chronic kidney disease.",

However, little is known about the molecular effectors underlying satellite cell impairment and depletion. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), are associated with both age-related and muscle-wasting conditions. The levels of STAT3, a downstream effector of IL-6, are also elevated with muscle wasting, and STAT3 has been implicated in the regulation of self-renewal and stem cell fate in several tissues. Here we show that IL-6-activated Stat3 signaling regulates satellite cell behavior, promoting myogenic lineage progression through myogenic differentiation 1 (Myod1) regulation. Conditional ablation of Stat3 in Pax7-expressing satellite cells resulted in their increased expansion during regeneration, but compromised myogenic differentiation prevented the contribution of these cells to regenerating myofibers. In contrast, transient Stat3 inhibition promoted satellite cell expansion and enhanced tissue repair in both aged and dystrophic muscle. The effects of STAT3 inhibition on cell fate and proliferation were conserved in human myoblasts. The results of this study indicate that pharmacological manipulation of STAT3 activity can be used to counteract the functional exhaustion of satellite cells in pathological conditions, thereby maintaining the endogenous regenerative response and ameliorating muscle-wasting diseases.",

NF1 is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene, which encodes the RAS GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. We report here that ablation of Nf1 in bone-forming cells leads to supraphysiologic accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of hydroxyapatite formation, and that a chronic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent increase in expression of genes promoting PPi synthesis and extracellular transport, namely Enpp1 and Ank, causes this phenotype. Nf1 ablation also prevents bone morphogenic protein-2-induced osteoprogenitor differentiation and, consequently, expression of alkaline phosphatase and PPi breakdown, further contributing to PPi accumulation. The short stature and impaired bone mineralization and strength in mice lacking Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors or osteoblasts can be corrected by asfotase-α enzyme therapy aimed at reducing PPi concentration. These results establish neurofibromin as an essential regulator of bone mineralization. They also suggest that altered PPi homeostasis contributes to the skeletal dysplasias associated with NF1 and that some of the NF1 skeletal conditions could be prevented pharmacologically.",

Here we analyzed children born with congenital genitourinary tract masculinization disorders by array-comparative genomic hybridization, which revealed in 1.35% of cases the presence of de novo copy number gains at Xq28 encompassing the VAMP7 gene, which encodes a vesicle-trafficking protein that is part of the SNARE complex. Transgenic mice carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome encoding human VAMP7 mimicked the defective urogenital traits observed in boys with masculinization disorders such as cryptorchidism, urethral defects and hypospadias. Transgenic mice also exhibited reduced penile length, focal spermatogenic anomalies, diminished sperm motility and subfertility. VAMP7 colocalized with estrogen receptor α (ESR1) in the presence of its cognate ligand, 17β-estradiol. Elevated levels of VAMP7 markedly intensified ESR1-potentiated transcriptional activity by increasing ESR1 protein cellular content upon ligand stimulation and upregulated the expression of estrogen-responsive genes including ATF3, CYR61 and CTGF, all of which have been implicated in human hypospadias. Hence, increased gene dosage of VAMP7, and thus higher expression levels of its protein product, enhances estrogen receptor action in male genitourinary tissues, affects the virilization of the reproductive tract and results in genitourinary birth defects in humans.",

One such element, liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1), is an orphan nuclear receptor that regulates metabolism and hormone synthesis. It is strongly expressed in granulosa cells of ovarian follicles and in the corpus luteum of rodents and humans. Germline ablation of Nr5a2 (also called Lrh-1), the gene coding for Lrh-1, in mice is embryonically lethal at gastrulation. Depletion of Lrh-1 in the ovarian follicle shows that it regulates genes required for both steroid synthesis and ovulation. To study the effects of Lrh-1 on mouse gestation, we genetically disrupted its expression in the corpus luteum, resulting in luteal insufficiency. Hormone replacement permitted embryo implantation but was followed by gestational failure with impaired endometrial decidualization, compromised placental formation, fetal growth retardation and fetal death. Lrh-1 is also expressed in the mouse and human endometrium, and in a primary culture of human endometrial stromal cells, reduction of NR5A2 transcript abundance by RNA interference abrogated decidualization. These findings show that Lrh-1 is necessary for maintenance of the corpus luteum, for promotion of decidualization and for formation of the placenta. It therefore has multiple, indispensible roles in establishing and sustaining pregnancy.",

We investigated the role of the acid sphingomyelinase (Asm)-ceramide system as a target for antidepressants. Therapeutic concentrations of the antidepressants amitriptyline and fluoxetine reduced Asm activity and ceramide concentrations in the hippocampus, increased neuronal proliferation, maturation and survival and improved behavior in mouse models of stress-induced depression. Genetic Asm deficiency abrogated these effects. Mice overexpressing Asm, heterozygous for acid ceramidase, treated with blockers of ceramide metabolism or directly injected with C16 ceramide in the hippocampus had higher ceramide concentrations and lower rates of neuronal proliferation, maturation and survival compared with controls and showed depression-like behavior even in the absence of stress. The decrease of ceramide abundance achieved by antidepressant-mediated inhibition of Asm normalized these effects. Lowering ceramide abundance may thus be a central goal for the future development of antidepressants.",

We hypothesized that studying the molecular determinants of endogenous neuroprotection in two well-established paradigms, the resistance of CA3 hippocampal neurons to global ischemia and the tolerance conferred by ischemic preconditioning (IPC), would reveal new neuroprotective targets. We found that the product of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 gene (TSC1), hamartin, is selectively induced by ischemia in hippocampal CA3 neurons. In CA1 neurons, hamartin was unaffected by ischemia but was upregulated by IPC preceding ischemia, which protects the otherwise vulnerable CA1 cells. Suppression of hamartin expression with TSC1 shRNA viral vectors both in vitro and in vivo increased the vulnerability of neurons to cell death following oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and ischemia. In vivo, suppression of TSC1 expression increased locomotor activity and decreased habituation in a hippocampal-dependent task. Overexpression of hamartin increased resistance to OGD by inducing productive autophagy through an mTORC1-dependent mechanism.",

Here we report a new role for the adhesion molecule E-selectin expressed exclusively by bone marrow endothelial cells in the vascular HSC niche. HSC quiescence was enhanced and self-renewal potential was increased in E-selectin knockout (Sele(-/-)) mice or after administration of an E-selectin antagonist, demonstrating that E-selectin promotes HSC proliferation and is a crucial component of the vascular niche. These effects are not mediated by canonical E-selectin ligands. Deletion or blockade of E-selectin enhances HSC survival threefold to sixfold after treatment of mice with chemotherapeutic agents or irradiation and accelerates blood neutrophil recovery. As bone marrow suppression is a severe side effect of high-dose chemotherapy, transient blockade of E-selectin is potentially a promising treatment for the protection of HSCs during chemotherapy or irradiation.",

The defective ERK signaling was caused by the dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), whose protein expression increased with age due to a decline in repression by miR-181a.

DUSP6 repression using miR-181a or specific siRNA and DUSP6 inhibition by the allosteric inhibitor (E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one improved CD4(+) T cell responses, as seen by increased expression of activation markers, improved proliferation and supported preferential T helper type 1 cell differentiation. DUSP6 is a potential intervention target for restoring T cell responses in the elderly, which may augment the effectiveness of vaccination.",

USP15 binds to the SMAD7-SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 2 (SMURF2) complex and deubiquitinates and stabilizes type I TGF-β receptor (TβR-I), leading to an enhanced TGF-β signal. High expression of USP15 correlates with high TGF-β activity, and the USP15 gene is found amplified in glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer. USP15 amplification confers poor prognosis in individuals with glioblastoma. Downregulation or inhibition of USP15 in a patient-derived orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma decreases TGF-β activity. Moreover, depletion of USP15 decreases the oncogenic capacity of patient-derived glioma-initiating cells due to the repression of TGF-β signaling. Our results show that USP15 regulates the TGF-β pathway and is a key factor in glioblastoma pathogenesis.",

Enhanced expression of these microRNAs mimics p38α deficiency and increases tumor growth in mouse models, but it also improves the response to chemotherapeutic agents. High-grade human ovarian adenocarcinomas that accumulate miR-200a have low concentrations of p38α and an associated oxidative stress signature. The miR200a-dependent stress signature correlates with improved survival of patients in response to treatment. Therefore, the role of miR-200a in stress could be a predictive marker for clinical outcome in ovarian cancer.

The role of RAF in cell proliferation has been linked to its ability to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK). Here we identify a MEK-independent role for RAF in tumor growth. Specifically, in mitotic cells, CRAF becomes phosphorylated on Ser338 and localizes to the mitotic spindle of proliferating tumor cells in vitro as well as in murine tumor models and in biopsies from individuals with cancer. Treatment of tumors with allosteric inhibitors, but not ATP-competitive RAF inhibitors, prevents CRAF phosphorylation on Ser338 and localization to the mitotic spindle and causes cell-cycle arrest at prometaphase. Furthermore, we identify phospho-Ser338 CRAF as a potential biomarker for tumor progression and a surrogate marker for allosteric RAF blockade. Mechanistically, CRAF, but not BRAF, associates with Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) at the centrosomes and spindle poles during G2/M. Indeed, allosteric or genetic inhibition of phospho-Ser338 CRAF impairs Plk1 activation and accumulation at the kinetochores, causing prometaphase arrest, whereas a phospho-mimetic Ser338D CRAF mutant potentiates Plk1 activation, mitosis and tumor progression in mice. These findings show a previously undefined role for RAF in tumor progression beyond the RAF-MEK-ERK paradigm, opening new avenues for targeting RAF in cancer.",

Currently, it is unclear why tumor cells preferentially home to and proliferate in the omentum, yet omental metastases typically represent the largest tumor in the abdominal cavities of women with ovarian cancer. We show here that primary human omental adipocytes promote homing, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells, and that adipokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8) mediate these activities. Adipocyte-ovarian cancer cell coculture led to the direct transfer of lipids from adipocytes to ovarian cancer cells and promoted in vitro and in vivo tumor growth. Furthermore, coculture induced lipolysis in adipocytes and β-oxidation in cancer cells, suggesting adipocytes act as an energy source for the cancer cells. A protein array identified upregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4, also known as aP2) in omental metastases as compared to primary ovarian tumors, and FABP4 expression was detected in ovarian cancer cells at the adipocyte-tumor cell interface. FABP4 deficiency substantially impaired metastatic tumor growth in mice, indicating that FABP4 has a key role in ovarian cancer metastasis. These data indicate adipocytes provide fatty acids for rapid tumor growth, identifying lipid metabolism and transport as new targets for the treatment of cancers where adipocytes are a major component of the microenvironment.",

The mechanisms modulating the sensitivity of erythroblasts to Epo remain poorly understood. We show that, when cultured with Epo at suboptimal concentrations, the growth and clonogenic potential of erythroblasts was rescued by transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1)-bound polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1). Under homeostatic conditions, erythroblast numbers were increased in mice expressing human IgA1 compared to control mice. Hypoxic stress of these mice led to increased amounts of pIgA1 and erythroblast expansion. Expression of human IgA1 or treatment of wild-type mice with the TfR1 ligands pIgA1 or iron-loaded transferrin (Fe-Tf) accelerated recovery from acute anemia. TfR1 engagement by either pIgA1 or Fe-Tf increased cell sensitivity to Epo by inducing activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways. These cellular responses were mediated through the TfR1-internalization motif, YXXΦ. Our results show that pIgA1 and TfR1 are positive regulators of erythropoiesis in both physiological and pathological situations. Targeting this pathway may provide alternate approaches to the treatment of ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia.",

Overexpression of miR-200s is associated with increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer and promotes metastatic colonization in mouse models, phenotypes that cannot be recapitulated by E-cadherin expression alone. Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed global shifts in gene expression upon miR-200 overexpression toward that of highly metastatic cells. miR-200s promote metastatic colonization partly through direct targeting of Sec23a, which mediates secretion of metastasis-suppressive proteins, including Igfbp4 and Tinagl1, as validated by functional and clinical correlation studies.

However, BRCA-deficient tumors represent only a small fraction of adult cancers, which might restrict the therapeutic utility of PARP inhibitor monotherapy. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) phosphorylates BRCA1, and this is essential for efficient formation of BRCA1 foci. Here we show that depletion or inhibition of Cdk1 compromises the ability of cells to repair DNA by homologous recombination. Combined inhibition of Cdk1 and PARP in BRCA-wild-type cancer cells resulted in reduced colony formation, delayed growth of human tumor xenografts and tumor regression with prolonged survival in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Inhibition of Cdk1 did not sensitize nontransformed cells or tissues to inhibition of PARP. Because reduced Cdk1 activity impaired BRCA1 function and consequently, repair by homologous recombination, inhibition of Cdk1 represents a plausible strategy for expanding the utility of PARP inhibitors to BRCA-proficient cancers.",

CSCs in many tumors--including cancers of the breast, pancreas, head and neck, colon, small intestine, liver, stomach, bladder and ovary--have been identified using the adhesion molecule CD44, either individually or in combination with other marker(s). Prostate CSCs with enhanced clonogenic and tumor-initiating and metastatic capacities are enriched in the CD44(+) cell population, but whether miRNAs regulate CD44(+) prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer metastasis remains unclear. Here we show, through expression analysis, that miR-34a, a p53 target, was underexpressed in CD44(+) prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft and primary tumors. Enforced expression of miR-34a in bulk or purified CD44(+) prostate cancer cells inhibited clonogenic expansion, tumor regeneration, and metastasis. In contrast, expression of miR-34a antagomirs in CD44(-) prostate cancer cells promoted tumor development and metastasis. Systemically delivered miR-34a inhibited prostate cancer metastasis and extended survival of tumor-bearing mice. We identified and validated CD44 as a direct and functional target of miR-34a and found that CD44 knockdown phenocopied miR-34a overexpression in inhibiting prostate cancer regeneration and metastasis. Our study shows that miR-34a is a key negative regulator of CD44(+) prostate cancer cells and establishes a strong rationale for developing miR-34a as a novel therapeutic agent against prostate CSCs.",

No unifying mechanism has yet explained how adiponectin can exert such a variety of beneficial systemic effects. Here, we show that adiponectin potently stimulates a ceramidase activity associated with its two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, and enhances ceramide catabolism and formation of its antiapoptotic metabolite--sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)--independently of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). Using models of inducible apoptosis in pancreatic beta cells and cardiomyocytes, we show that transgenic overproduction of adiponectin decreases caspase-8-mediated death, whereas genetic ablation of adiponectin enhances apoptosis in vivo through a sphingolipid-mediated pathway. Ceramidase activity is impaired in cells lacking both adiponectin receptor isoforms, leading to elevated ceramide levels and enhanced susceptibility to palmitate-induced cell death. Combined, our observations suggest a unifying mechanism of action for the beneficial systemic effects exerted by adiponectin, with sphingolipid metabolism as its core upstream signaling component.",

Here we show that vascular endothelial cells can transform into multipotent stem-like cells by an activin-like kinase-2 (ALK2) receptor-dependent mechanism. In lesions from individuals with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disease in which heterotopic ossification occurs as a result of activating ALK2 mutations, or from transgenic mice expressing constitutively active ALK2, chondrocytes and osteoblasts expressed endothelial markers. Lineage tracing of heterotopic ossification in mice using a Tie2-Cre construct also suggested an endothelial origin of these cell types. Expression of constitutively active ALK2 in endothelial cells caused endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and acquisition of a stem cell-like phenotype. Similar results were obtained by treatment of untransfected endothelial cells with the ligands transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) or bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) in an ALK2-dependent manner. These stem-like cells could be triggered to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes or adipocytes. We suggest that conversion of endothelial cells to stem-like cells may provide a new approach to tissue engineering.",

Here we describe a miRNA, miR-380-5p, that represses p53 expression via a conserved sequence in the p53 3' untranslated region (UTR). miR-380-5p is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells and neuroblastomas, and high expression correlates with poor outcome in neuroblastomas with neuroblastoma derived v-myc myelocytomatosis viral-related oncogene (MYCN) amplification. miR-380 overexpression cooperates with activated HRAS oncoprotein to transform primary cells, block oncogene-induced senescence and form tumors in mice. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-380-5p in embryonic stem or neuroblastoma cells results in induction of p53, and extensive apoptotic cell death. In vivo delivery of a miR-380-5p antagonist decreases tumor size in an orthotopic mouse model of neuroblastoma. We demonstrate a new mechanism of p53 regulation in cancer and stem cells and uncover a potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.",

However, the cells can switch phenotype through epigenetic changes mediated by JARID1B, a histone modifier, suggesting a plastic process. They found that human cells expressing JAR1D1B could initiate and sustain melanoma growth when implanted into mice, whereas JARD1B-negative cells could only initiate tumors.

Here we demonstrate that H3K56ac in C. albicans is regulated by the RTT109 and HST3 genes, which respectively encode the H3K56 acetyltransferase (Rtt109p) and deacetylase (Hst3p). We show that reduced levels of H3K56ac sensitize C. albicans to genotoxic and antifungal agents. Inhibition of Hst3p activity by conditional gene repression or nicotinamide treatment results in a loss of cell viability associated with abnormal filamentous growth, histone degradation and gross aberrations in DNA staining. We show that genetic or pharmacological alterations in H3K56ac levels reduce virulence in a mouse model of C. albicans infection. Our results demonstrate that modulation of H3K56ac is a unique strategy for treatment of C. albicans and, possibly, other fungal infections.",

The existing paradigm describes the peptidoglycan network as a static structure that is cross-linked predominantly by 4-->3 transpeptide linkages. However, the nonclassical 3-->3 linkages predominate the transpeptide networking of the peptidoglycan layer of nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecular basis of these linkages and their role in the physiology of the peptidoglycan layer, virulence and susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to drugs remain undefined. Here we identify MT2594 as an L,D-transpeptidase that generates 3-->3 linkages in M. tuberculosis. We show that the loss of this protein leads to altered colony morphology, loss of virulence and increased susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate during the chronic phase of infection. This suggests that 3-->3 cross-linking is vital to the physiology of the peptidoglycan layer. Although a functional homolog exists, expression of ldtMt2 is dominant throughout the growth phases of M. tuberculosis. 4-->3 transpeptide linkages are targeted by one of the most widely used classes of antibacterial drugs in human clinical use today, beta-lactams. Recently, meropenem-clavulanate was shown to be effective against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Our study suggests that a combination of L,D-transpeptidase and beta-lactamase inhibitors could effectively target persisting bacilli during the chronic phase of tuberculosis.",

Here we identify an oncogene-tumor suppressor cascade that promotes prostate cancer growth and metastasis by coordinately activating the small GTPase Ras and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Specifically, we show that loss of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) gene DAB2IP induces metastatic prostate cancer in an orthotopic mouse tumor model. Notably, DAB2IP functions as a signaling scaffold that coordinately regulates Ras and NF-kappaB through distinct domains to promote tumor growth and metastasis, respectively. DAB2IP is suppressed in human prostate cancer, where its expression inversely correlates with tumor grade and predicts prognosis. Moreover, we report that epigenetic silencing of DAB2IP is a key mechanism by which the polycomb-group protein histone-lysine N-methyltransferase EZH2 activates Ras and NF-kappaB and triggers metastasis. These studies define the mechanism by which two major pathways can be simultaneously activated in metastatic prostate cancer and establish EZH2 as a driver of metastasis.",

        "TEXT": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (HNF-1beta) is a transcription factor required for the expression of several renal cystic genes and whose prenatal deletion leads to polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We show here that inactivation of Hnf1b from postnatal day 10 onward does not elicit cystic dilations in tubules after their proliferative morphogenetic elongation is over. Cystogenic resistance is intrinsically linked to the quiescent state of cells. In fact, when Hnf1b deficient quiescent cells are forced to proliferate by an ischemia-reperfusion injury, they give rise to cysts, owing to loss of oriented cell division. Remarkably, in quiescent cells, the transcription of crucial cystogenic target genes is maintained even in the absence of HNF-1beta. However, their expression is lost as soon as cells proliferate and the chromatin of target genes acquires heterochromatin marks. These results unveil a previously undescribed aspect of gene regulation. It is well established that transcription is shut off during the mitotic condensation of chromatin. We propose that transcription factors such as HNF-1beta might be involved in reprogramming gene expression after transcriptional silencing is induced by mitotic chromatin condensation. Notably, HNF-1beta remains associated with the mitotically condensed chromosomal barrels. This association suggests that HNF-1beta is a bookmarking factor that is necessary for reopening the chromatin of target genes after mitotic silencing.",

Here we show that inhibition or knockdown of calpains protects LIS1 from proteolysis, resulting in the augmentation of LIS1 amounts in Lis1(+/-) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and rescue of the aberrant distribution of cytoplasmic dynein, mitochondria and beta-COP-positive vesicles. We also show that calpain inhibitors improve neuronal migration of Lis1(+/-) cerebellar granular neurons. Intraperitoneal injection of the calpain inhibitor ALLN to pregnant Lis1(+/-) dams rescued apoptotic neuronal cell death and neuronal migration defects in Lis1(+/-) offspring. Furthermore, in utero knockdown of calpain by short hairpin RNA rescued defective cortical layering in Lis1(+/-) mice. Thus, calpain inhibition is a potential therapeutic intervention for lissencephaly.",

Here we show that human basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are frequently ciliated, and we test the role of cilia in BCC by conditionally deleting Kif3a (encoding kinesin family member 3A) or Ift88 (encoding intraflagellar transport protein 88), genes required for ciliogenesis, in two Hh pathway-dependent mouse tumor models. Ciliary ablation strongly inhibited BCC-like tumors induced by an activated form of Smoothened. In contrast, removal of cilia accelerated tumors induced by activated Gli2, a transcriptional effector of Hh signaling. These seemingly paradoxical effects are consistent with a dual role for cilia in mediating both the activation and the repression of the Hh signaling pathway. Our findings demonstrate that cilia function as unique signaling organelles that can either mediate or suppress tumorigenesis depending on the nature of the oncogenic initiating event.",

The Wnt-beta-catenin pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that promotes hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and multipotency by limiting stem cell proliferation and differentiation, but its role in the generation and maintenance of memory T cells is unknown. We found that induction of Wnt-beta-catenin signaling by inhibitors of glycogen sythase kinase-3beta or the Wnt protein family member Wnt3a arrested CD8(+) T cell development into effector cells. By blocking T cell differentiation, Wnt signaling promoted the generation of CD44(low)CD62L(high)Sca-1(high)CD122(high)Bcl-2(high) self-renewing multipotent CD8(+) memory stem cells with proliferative and antitumor capacities exceeding those of central and effector memory T cell subsets.

Moreover, hypoxia is the major driving force for neovascularization, as the hypoxia-mediated induction of vascular growth factors triggers endothelial cell proliferation. Here we studied the role of the hypoxia-induced DNA damage response in endothelial cell function and in hypoxia-driven neovascularization in vivo. Hypoxia induced replication-associated generation of gamma-H2AX in endothelial cells in vitro and in mice. Both in cultured cells and in mice, endothelial cell proliferation under hypoxic conditions was reduced by H2AX deficiency. Whereas developmental angiogenesis was not affected in H2afx(-/-) mice, hypoxia-induced neovascularization during pathologic proliferative retinopathy, in response to hind limb ischemia or during tumor angiogenesis was substantially lower in H2afx(-/-) mice. Moreover, endothelial-specific H2afx deletion resulted in reduced hypoxia-driven retina neovascularization and tumor neovascularization. Our findings establish that H2AX, and hence activation of the DNA repair response, is needed for endothelial cells to maintain their proliferation under hypoxic conditions and is crucial for hypoxia-driven neovascularization.",

Fibrous tissue formation is regulated by the balance between plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), which reciprocally regulate fibrin deposition. Several components of the inflammatory system, including cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules and neuropeptide substance P, have been reported to participate in adhesion formation. We have used cecal cauterization to develop a unique experimental mouse model of intestinal adhesion. Mice developed severe intestinal adhesion after this treatment. Adhesion development depended upon the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) system. Natural killer T (NKT) cell-deficient mice developed adhesion poorly, whereas they developed severe adhesion after reconstitution with NKT cells from wild-type mice, suggesting that NKT cell IFN-gamma production is indispensable for adhesion formation. This response does not depend on STAT4, STAT6, interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, Toll-like receptor 4 or myeloid differentiation factor-88-mediated signals. Wild-type mice increased the ratio of PAI-1 to tPA after cecal cauterization, whereas Ifng(-/-) or Stat1(-/-) mice did not, suggesting that IFN-gamma has a crucial role in the differential regulation of PAI-1 and tPA. Additionally, hepatocyte growth factor, a potent mitogenic factor for hepatocytes, strongly inhibited intestinal adhesion by diminishing IFN-gamma production, providing a potential new way to prevent postoperative adhesions.",

Activation of Robo4 by Slit2 inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165-induced migration, tube formation and permeability in vitro and VEGF-165-stimulated vascular leak in vivo by blocking Src family kinase activation. In mouse models of retinal and choroidal vascular disease, Slit2 inhibited angiogenesis and vascular leak, whereas deletion of Robo4 enhanced these pathologic processes.

        "TEXT": "Integrin-mediated platelet adhesion and aggregation are essential for sealing injured blood vessels and preventing blood loss, and excessive platelet aggregation can initiate arterial thrombosis, causing heart attacks and stroke. To ensure that platelets aggregate only at injury sites, integrins on circulating platelets exist in a low-affinity state and shift to a high-affinity state (in a process known as integrin activation or priming) after contacting a wounded vessel. The shift is mediated through binding of the cytoskeletal protein Talin to the beta subunit cytoplasmic tail. Here we show that platelets lacking the adhesion plaque protein Kindlin-3 cannot activate integrins despite normal Talin expression. As a direct consequence, Kindlin-3 deficiency results in severe bleeding and resistance to arterial thrombosis. Mechanistically, Kindlin-3 can directly bind to regions of beta-integrin tails distinct from those of Talin and trigger integrin activation. We have therefore identified Kindlin-3 as a novel and essential element for platelet integrin activation in hemostasis and thrombosis.",

Although Akt is known to be a crucial signaling protein in the myocardium, the role of Pim-1 has been overlooked. Pim-1 expression in the myocardium of mice decreased during postnatal development, re-emerged after acute pathological injury in mice and was increased in failing hearts of both mice and humans. Cardioprotective stimuli associated with Akt activation induced Pim-1 expression, but compensatory increases in Akt abundance and phosphorylation after pathological injury by infarction or pressure overload did not protect the myocardium in Pim-1-deficient mice. Transgenic expression of Pim-1 in the myocardium protected mice from infarction injury, and Pim-1 expression inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis with concomitant increases in Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) protein levels, as well as in Bad phosphorylation levels. Relative to nontransgenic controls, calcium dynamics were significantly enhanced in Pim-1-overexpressing transgenic hearts, associated with increased expression of SERCA2a, and were depressed in Pim-1-deficient hearts. Collectively, these data suggest that Pim-1 is a crucial facet of cardioprotection downstream of Akt.",

Proteoglycans have critical roles in chondrogenesis and skeletal development. The glycosaminoglycan chains found in cartilage proteoglycans are primarily composed of chondroitin sulfate. The integrity of chondroitin sulfate chains is important to cartilage proteoglycan function; however, chondroitin sulfate metabolism in mammals remains poorly understood. The solute carrier-35 D1 (SLC35D1) gene (SLC35D1) encodes an endoplasmic reticulum nucleotide-sugar transporter (NST) that might transport substrates needed for chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. Here we created Slc35d1-deficient mice that develop a lethal form of skeletal dysplasia with severe shortening of limbs and facial structures. Epiphyseal cartilage in homozygous mutant mice showed a decreased proliferating zone with round chondrocytes, scarce matrices and reduced proteoglycan aggregates. These mice had short, sparse chondroitin sulfate chains caused by a defect in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis. We also identified that loss-of-function mutations in human SLC35D1 cause Schneckenbecken dysplasia, a severe skeletal dysplasia. Our findings highlight the crucial role of NSTs in proteoglycan function and cartilage metabolism, thus revealing a new paradigm for skeletal disease and glycobiology.",

Phagocytic cells play a crucial part in the prevention of sepsis by clearing bacteria through host innate receptors. Here we show that the FcRgamma adaptor, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing signal transduction subunit of the Fc receptor family, has a deleterious effect on sepsis. FcRgamma(-/-) mice show increased survival during peritonitis, owing to markedly increased E. coli phagocytosis and killing and to lower production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. The FcRgamma-associated receptor that inhibits E. coli phagocytosis is FcgammaRIII (also called CD16), and its absence protects mice from sepsis. FcgammaRIII binds E. coli, and this interaction induces FcRgamma phosphorylation, recruitment of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and phosphatidylinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) dephosphorylation. Decreased PI3K activity inhibits E. coli phagocytosis and increases TNF-alpha production through Toll-like receptor 4. We identified the phagocytic receptor negatively regulated by FcRgamma on macrophages as the class A scavenger receptor MARCO. E. coli-FcgammaRIII interaction induces the recruitment of SHP-1 to MARCO, thereby inhibiting E. coli phagocytosis. Thus, by binding FcgammaRIII, E. coli triggers an inhibitory FcRgamma pathway that both impairs MARCO-mediated bacterial clearance and activates TNF-alpha secretion.",

Although a major commonly deleted region (CDR) has been delineated on chromosome band 5q31.1 (refs. 3-7), attempts to identify tumor suppressors within this band have been unsuccessful. We focused our analysis of gene expression on RNA from primitive leukemia-initiating cells, which harbor 5q deletions, and analyzed 12 genes within the CDR that are expressed by normal hematopoietic stem cells. Here we show that the gene encoding alpha-catenin (CTNNA1) is expressed at a much lower level in leukemia-initiating stem cells from individuals with AML or MDS with a 5q deletion than in individuals with MDS or AML lacking a 5q deletion or in normal hematopoietic stem cells. Analysis of HL-60 cells, a myeloid leukemia line with deletion of the 5q31 region, showed that the CTNNA1 promoter of the retained allele is suppressed by both methylation and histone deacetylation. Restoration of CTNNA1 expression in HL-60 cells resulted in reduced proliferation and apoptotic cell death. Thus, loss of expression of the alpha-catenin tumor suppressor in hematopoietic stem cells may provide a growth advantage that contributes to human MDS or AML with del(5q).",

Here we have characterized the responses in lungs induced by hyperoxia in wild-type and Ang2-/- mice or those given either recombinant Ang2 or short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to Ang2. During hyperoxia Ang2 expression is induced in lung epithelial cells, while hyperoxia-induced oxidant injury, cell death, inflammation, permeability alterations and mortality are ameliorated in Ang2-/- and siRNA-treated mice. Hyperoxia induces and activates the extrinsic and mitochondrial cell death pathways and activates initiator and effector caspases through Ang2-dependent pathways in vivo. Ang2 increases inflammation and cell death during hyperoxia in vivo and stimulates epithelial necrosis in hyperoxia in vitro. Ang2 in plasma and alveolar edema fluid is increased in adults with ALI and pulmonary edema. Tracheal Ang2 is also increased in neonates that develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Ang2 is thus a mediator of epithelial necrosis with an important role in hyperoxic ALI and pulmonary edema.",

Here we show that E2-EPF ubiquitin carrier protein (UCP) associates with and targets pVHL for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in cells, thereby stabilizing HIF-1alpha. UCP is detected coincidently with HIF-1alpha in human primary liver, colon and breast tumors, and metastatic cholangiocarcinoma and colon cancer cells. UCP level correlates inversely with pVHL level in most tumor cell lines. In vitro and in vivo, forced expression of UCP boosts tumor-cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis through effects on the pVHL-HIF pathway. Our results suggest that UCP helps stabilize HIF-1alpha and may be a new molecular target for therapeutic intervention in human cancers.",

Virus-inducible levels of Ccl5 are required to prevent apoptosis of virus-infected mouse macrophages in vivo and mouse and human macrophages ex vivo. The protective effect of Ccl5 requires activation of the Ccr5 chemokine receptor and consequent bilateral activation of G(alphai)-PI3K-AKT and G(alphai)-MEK-ERK signaling pathways.

Here we show that mice with inactivation of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors have increased bone mass and are protected from ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Pharmacological antagonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors prevented ovariectomy-induced bone loss in vivo and caused osteoclast inhibition in vitro by promoting osteoclast apoptosis and inhibiting production of several osteoclast survival factors. These studies show that the CB1 receptor has a role in the regulation of bone mass and ovariectomy-induced bone loss and that CB1- and CB2-selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists are a new class of osteoclast inhibitors that may be of value in the treatment of osteoporosis and other bone diseases.",

We report that ceramide, a second messenger lipid, is a crucial mediator of alveolar destruction in emphysema. Inhibition of enzymes controlling de novo ceramide synthesis prevented alveolar cell apoptosis, oxidative stress and emphysema caused by blockade of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors in both rats and mice. Emphysema was reproduced with intratracheal instillation of ceramide in naive mice. Excessive ceramide triggers a feed-forward mechanism mediated by activation of secretory acid sphingomyelinase, as suggested by experiments with neutralizing ceramide antibody in mice and with acid sphingomyelinase-deficient fibroblasts. Concomitant augmentation of signaling initiated by a prosurvival metabolite, sphingosine-1-phosphate, prevented lung apoptosis, implying that a balance between ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate is required for maintenance of alveolar septal integrity. Finally, increased lung ceramides in individuals with smoking-induced emphysema suggests that ceramide upregulation may be a crucial pathogenic element and a promising target in this disease that currently lacks effective therapies.",

Here we show that mice deficient in apolipoprotein M (apoM), a component of the HDL particle, accumulated cholesterol in large HDL particles (HDL(1)) while the conversion of HDL to prebeta-HDL was impaired. Accordingly, apoM-deficient mice lacked prebeta-HDL, a subclass of lipid-poor apolipoproteins that serves as a key acceptor of peripheral cellular cholesterol. This deficiency led to a markedly reduced cholesterol efflux from macrophages to apoM-deficient HDL compared to normal HDL in vitro. Overexpression of apoM in Ldlr(-/-) mice protected against atherosclerosis when the mice were challenged with a cholesterol-enriched diet, showing that apoM is important for the formation of prebeta-HDL and cholesterol efflux to HDL, and thereby inhibits formation of atherosclerotic lesions.",

Defective bone remodeling caused by altered osteoclast activity underlies a multitude of osteopenic disorders. Receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) and its ligand RANKL have been identified as essential factors involved in osteoclast development and bone remodeling, but their mechanism and interacting factors have not been fully characterized. Here we report that the molecular adapter Grb-2-associated binder-2 (Gab2) associates with RANK and mediates RANK-induced activation of NF-kappaB, Akt and Jnk. Inactivation of the gene encoding Gab2 in mice results in osteopetrosis and decreased bone resorption as a result of defective osteoclast differentiation. We also show that Gab2 has a crucial role in the differentiation of human progenitor cells into osteoclasts. We have thus identified a new, key regulatory scaffold molecule, Gab2, that controls select RANK signaling pathways and is essential for osteoclastogenesis and bone homeostasis.",

Elevation of the immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in tumor cells can facilitate immune escape. Not known is how IDO becomes elevated or whether IDO inhibitors will be useful for cancer treatment. Here we show that IDO is under genetic control of Bin1, which is attenuated in many human malignancies. Mouse knockout studies indicate that Bin1 loss elevates the STAT1- and NF-kappaB-dependent expression of IDO, driving escape of oncogenically transformed cells from T cell-dependent antitumor immunity. In MMTV-Neu mice, an established breast cancer model, we show that small-molecule inhibitors of IDO cooperate with cytotoxic agents to elicit regression of established tumors refractory to single-agent therapy. Our findings suggest that Bin1 loss promotes immune escape in cancer by deregulating IDO and that IDO inhibitors may improve responses to cancer chemotherapy.",

Clinical trials are now testing whether mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition is useful in treating PTEN-null cancers. Here, we report that mTOR inhibition induced apoptosis of epithelial cells and the complete reversal of a neoplastic phenotype in the prostate of mice expressing human AKT1 in the ventral prostate. Induction of cell death required the mitochondrial pathway, as prostate-specific coexpression of BCL2 blocked apoptosis. Thus, there is an mTOR-dependent survival signal required downstream of Akt. Bcl2 expression, however, only partially restored intraluminal cell growth in the setting of mTOR inhibition. Expression profiling showed that Hif-1 alpha targets, including genes encoding most glycolytic enzymes, constituted the dominant transcriptional response to AKT activation and mTOR inhibition. These data suggest that the expansion of AKT-driven prostate epithelial cells requires mTOR-dependent survival signaling and activation of HIF-1 alpha, and that clinical resistance to mTOR inhibitors may emerge through BCL2 expression and/or upregulation of HIF-1 alpha activity.",

The N terminus of Nogo-B promotes the migration of endothelial cells but inhibits the migration of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells, processes necessary for vascular remodeling. Vascular injury in Nogo-A/B-deficient mice promotes exaggerated neointimal proliferation, and adenoviral-mediated gene transfer of Nogo-B rescues the abnormal vascular expansion in those knockout mice. Our discovery that Nogo-B is a regulator of vascular homeostasis and remodeling broadens the functional scope of this family of proteins.",

        "TEXT": "The clinical outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI) depends in part on the extent of secondary damage, to which apoptosis contributes. The CD95 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand/receptor systems play an essential role in various apoptotic mechanisms. To determine the involvement of these ligands in SCI-induced damage, we neutralized the activity of CD95 ligand (CD95L) and/or TNF in spinal cord-injured mice. Therapeutic neutralization of CD95L, but not of TNF, significantly decreased apoptotic cell death after SCI. Mice treated with CD95L-specific antibodies were capable of initiating active hind-limb movements several weeks after injury. The improvement in locomotor performance was mirrored by an increase in regenerating fibers and upregulation of growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43). Thus, neutralization of CD95L promoted axonal regeneration and functional improvement in injured adult animals. This therapeutic strategy may constitute a potent future treatment for human spinal injury.",

Autoreactive T cells are normally eliminated by functional inactivation (anergy) and activation-induced cell death (AICD) or apoptosis through death receptor (Fas) signaling. However, mutations in the genes encoding Fas and its ligand (FasL) are rare in classical SLE. By gene microarray profiling, validated by functional and biochemical studies, we establish here that activated T cells of lupus patients resist anergy and apoptosis by markedly upregulating and sustaining cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. Inhibition of COX-2 caused apoptosis of the anergy-resistant lupus T cells by augmenting Fas signaling and markedly decreasing the survival molecule c-FLIP (cellular homolog of viral FLICE inhibitory protein). Studies with COX-2 inhibitors and Cox-2-deficient mice confirmed that this COX-2/FLIP antiapoptosis program is used selectively by anergy-resistant lupus T cells, and not by cancer cells or other autoimmune T cells. Notably, the gene encoding COX-2 is located in a lupus-susceptibility region on chromosome 1. We also found that only some COX-2 inhibitors were able to suppress the production of pathogenic autoantibodies to DNA by causing autoimmune T-cell apoptosis, an effect that was independent of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). These findings could be useful in the design of lupus therapies.",

Egr-1 DNAzymes blocked angiogenesis in subcutaneous Matrigel plugs in mice, an observation that was independently confirmed by plug analysis in Egr-1-deficient animals, and inhibited MCF-7 human breast carcinoma growth in nude mice. Egr-1 DNAzymes suppressed tumor growth without influencing body weight, wound healing, blood coagulation or other hematological parameters. These agents inhibited endothelial expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, a proangiogenic factor downstream of Egr-1, but not that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

An EP4 agonist promoted the migration of Langerhans cells, increased their expression of costimulatory molecules and enhanced their ability to stimulate T cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction in vitro.

Here we show that simultaneous loss of Ink4a/Arf function and disruption of c-Met signaling in Ink4a/Arf(-/-) mice transgenic for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) induces RMS with extremely high penetrance and short latency. In cultured myoblasts, c-Met activation and Ink4a/Arf loss suppress myogenesis in an additive fashion. Our data indicate that human c-MET and INK4a/ARF, situated at the nexus of pathways regulating myogenic growth and differentiation, represent critical targets in RMS pathogenesis.

The mechanism underlying p27(kip1) deregulation in human cancer is, however, poorly understood. We demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase Akt regulates cell proliferation in breast cancer cells by preventing p27(kip1)-mediated growth arrest. Threonine 157 (T157), which maps within the nuclear localization signal of p27(kip1), is a predicted Akt-phosphorylation site. Akt-induced T157 phosphorylation causes retention of p27(kip1) in the cytoplasm, precluding p27(kip1)-induced G1 arrest. Conversely, the p27(kip1)-T157A mutant accumulates in cell nuclei and Akt does not affect p27(kip1)-T157A-mediated cell cycle arrest. Lastly, T157-phosphorylated p27(kip1) accumulates in the cytoplasm of primary human breast cancer cells coincident with Akt activation. Thus, cytoplasmic relocalization of p27(kip1), secondary to Akt-mediated phosphorylation, is a novel mechanism whereby the growth inhibitory properties of p27(kip1) are functionally inactivated and the proliferation of breast cancer cells is sustained.",

Inhibition of VEGFR1, but not VEGFR2, blocked HSC cell cycling, differentiation and hematopoietic recovery after BM suppression, resulting in the demise of the treated mice. Placental growth factor (PlGF), which signals through VEGFR1, restored early and late phases of hematopoiesis following BM suppression. PlGF enhanced early phases of BM recovery directly through rapid chemotaxis of VEGFR1(+) BM-repopulating and progenitor cells. The late phase of hematopoietic recovery was driven by PlGF-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9, mediating the release of soluble Kit ligand.

An antibody against Flt1 suppressed neovascularization in tumors and ischemic retina, and angiogenesis and inflammatory joint destruction in autoimmune arthritis. Anti-Flt1 also reduced atherosclerotic plaque growth and vulnerability, but the atheroprotective effect was not attributable to reduced plaque neovascularization. Inhibition of VEGF receptor Flk1 did not affect arthritis or atherosclerosis, indicating that inhibition of Flk1-driven angiogenesis alone was not sufficient to halt disease progression. The anti-inflammatory effects of anti-Flt1 were attributable to reduced mobilization of bone marrow-derived myeloid progenitors into the peripheral blood; impaired infiltration of Flt1-expressing leukocytes in inflamed tissues; and defective activation of myeloid cells. Thus, PlGF and Flt1 constitute potential candidates for therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis and inflammation.",

The plasma phospholipid-transfer protein (PLTP) is known to mediate transfer of phospholipids between BLp and HDL during their intravascular metabolism. To address a possible role of PLTP in dyslipidemia and atherogenesis, we bred mice deficient in the gene encoding PLTP (PLTP-deficient mice) using different hyperlipidemic mouse strains. In ApoB-transgenic and ApoE-deficient backgrounds, PLTP deficiency resulted in reduced production and levels of BLp and markedly decreased atherosclerosis. BLp secretion was diminished in hepatocytes from ApoB-transgenic PLTP-deficient mice, a defect that was corrected when PLTP was reintroduced in adenovirus. The studies reveal a major, unexpected role of PLTP in regulating the secretion of BLp and identify PLTP as a therapeutic target.",

Here we report that HO-1 directly reduces vasoconstriction and inhibits cell proliferation during vascular injury. Expression of HO-1 in arteries stimulated vascular relaxation, mediated by guanylate cyclase and cGMP, independent of nitric oxide. The unexpected effects of HO-1 on vascular smooth muscle cell growth were mediated by cell-cycle arrest involving p21Cip1. HO-1 reduced the proliferative response to vascular injury in vivo; expression of HO-1 in pig arteries inhibited lesion formation and Hmox1-/- mice produced hyperplastic arteries compared with controls. Induction of the HO-1 pathway moderates the severity of vascular injury by at least two adaptive mechanisms independent of nitric oxide, and is a potential therapeutic target for diseases of the vasculature.",

Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha triggers neutrophilic differentiation, and Cebpa knockout mice exhibit an early block in maturation. Dominant-negative mutations of CEBPA have been found in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not in AML with the t(8;21) translocation which gives rise to the fusion gene RUNX1-CBF2T1 (also known as AML1-ETO) encoding the AML1-ETO fusion protein. RUNX1-CBF2T1 positive-AML blasts had eight-fold lower CEBPA RNA levels and undetectable C/EBPalpha protein levels compared with other subgroups of AML patients. Conditional expression of RUNX1-CBF2T1 in U937 cells downregulated CEBPA mRNA, protein and DNA binding activity. AML1-ETO appears to suppress C/EBPalpha expression indirectly by inhibiting positive autoregulation of the CEBPA promoter. Conditional expression of C/EBPalpha in AML1-ETO-positive Kasumi-1 cells results in neutrophilic differentiation. We suggest that restoring C/EBPalpha expression will have therapeutic implications in RUNX1-CBF2T1-positive leukemias.",

Moreover, osteoblast differentiation, but not proliferation, was enhanced and osteoclastogenesis was also elevated in vitro.

Here, we used two distinct systems to assess the requirement for T-cell deletion in peripheral tolerance induction. In mice transgenic for Bcl-xL, T cells were resistant to passive cell death through cytokine withdrawal, whereas T cells from interleukin-2-deficient mice did not undergo activation-induced cell death. Using either agents that block co-stimulatory pathways or the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, which we have shown here blocks the proliferative component of interleukin-2 signaling but does not inhibit priming for activation-induced cell death, we found that mice with defective passive or active T-cell apoptotic pathways were resistant to induction of transplantation tolerance.

The transcription factor NF-kappaB is activated by chemotherapy and by irradiation in some cancer cell lines. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-kappaB in vitro leads to enhanced apoptosis in response to a variety of different stimuli. We show here that inhibition of NF-kappaB through the adenoviral delivery of a modified form of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB, sensitizes chemoresistant tumors to the apoptotic potential of TNFalpha and of the chemotherapeutic compound CPT-11, resulting in tumor regression. These results demonstrate that the activation of NF-kappaB in response to chemotherapy is a principal mechanism of inducible tumor chemoresistance, and establish the inhibition of NF-kappaB as a new approach to adjuvant therapy in cancer treatment.",

We have examined the effect of p53 inactivation on atherogenesis in apoE-knockout mice, an animal model for atherosclerosis. We found that, compared with p53+/+/apoE-/- mice, p53-/-/apoE-/- mice developed considerably accelerated aortic atherosclerosis in the presence of a similar serum cholesterol in response to a high-fat diet. Furthermore, the atherosclerotic lesions in p53-/-/apoE-/- mice had a significant (approximately 280%) increase in cell proliferation rate and an insignificant (approximately 180%) increase in apoptosis compared with those in p53+/+/apoE-/- mice. Our observations indicate that the role of p53 in atherosclerotic lesion development might be associated with its function in cell replication control, and that p53-independent mechanisms can mediate the apoptotic response in atherosclerosis.",

PGE2, a chief cyclooxygenase product, modulates blood pressure and fertility, although the specific G protein-coupled receptors mediating these effects remain poorly defined. To evaluate the physiologic role of the PGE2 EP2 receptor subtype, we created mice with targeted disruption of this gene (EP2-/-). EP2-/- mice develop normally but produce small litters and have slightly elevated baseline systolic blood pressure. In EP2-/- mice, the characteristic hypotensive effect of intravenous PGE2 infusion was absent; PGE2 infusion instead produced hypertension. When fed a diet high in salt, the EP2-/- mice developed profound systolic hypertension, whereas wild-type mice showed no change in systolic blood pressure. Analysis of wild-type and EP2-/- mice on day 5 of pregnancy indicated that the reduced litter size of EP2-/- mice is due to a pre-implantation defect. This reduction of implanted embryos could be accounted for by impaired ovulation and dramatic reductions in fertilization observed on day 2 of pregnancy. These data demonstrate that the EP2 receptor mediates arterial dilatation, salt-sensitive hypertension, and also plays an essential part in female fertility.",

        "TEXT": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein binds to both cellular and viral proteins, which influence its biological activity. One such protein is the large E1b tumor antigen (E1b58kDa) from adenoviruses (Ads), which abrogates the ability of p53 to transactivate various promoters. This inactivation of p53 function is believed to be the mechanism by which E1b58kDa contributes to the cell transformation process. Although the p53-E1b58kDa complex occurs during infection and is conserved among different serotypes, there are limited data demonstrating that it has a role in virus replication. However, loss of p53 expression occurs after adenovirus infection of human cells and an E1b58kDa deletion mutant (Onyx-015, also called dl 1520) selectively replicates in p53-defective cells. These (and other) data indicate a plausible hypothesis is that loss of p53 function may be conducive to efficient adenovirus replication. However, wild-type (wt) Ad5 grows more efficiently in cells expressing a wt p53 protein. These studies indicate that the hypothesis may be an oversimplification. Here, we show that cells expressing wt p53, as well as p53-defective cells, allow adenovirus replication, but only cells expressing wt p53 show evidence of virus-induced cytopathic effect. This correlates with the ability of adenovirus to induce cell death. Our data indicate that p53 plays a necessary part in mediating cellular destruction to allow a productive adenovirus infection. In contrast, p53-deficient cells are less sensitive to the cytolytic effects of adenovirus and as such raise questions about the use of E1b58kDa-deficient adenoviruses in tumor therapy.",

We show here that PPARgamma is expressed at high levels in both well- and poorly-differentiated adenocarcinomas, in normal colonic mucosa and in human colon cancer cell lines. Ligand activation of this receptor in colon cancer cells causes a considerable reduction in linear and clonogenic growth, increased expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and the reversal of many gene expression events specifically associated with colon cancer. Transplantable tumors derived from human colon cancer cells show a significant reduction of growth when mice are treated with troglitazone, a PPARgamma ligand.

We report that NEP expression and catalytic activity are lost in vitro in androgen-independent but not androgen-dependent PC cell lines. In vivo, NEP protein expression is commonly decreased in cancer cells of metastatic PC specimens from patients with androgen-independent but not androgen-dependent PC. Overexpression of NEP in androgen-independent PC cells or incubation with recombinant NEP inhibits PC cell growth. Furthermore, in androgen-dependent PC cells, expression of NEP is transcriptionally regulated by androgen and decreases with androgen withdrawal. These data suggest that decreased NEP expression, common in androgen-independent PCs, is facilitated by the elimination of androgens, and that NEP loss plays an important role in the development of androgen-independent PC by allowing PC cells to use mitogenic neuropeptides as an alternate source to androgen in order to stimulate cell proliferation.",

        "TEXT": "The induction of tumor cell death by anticancer therapy results from a genetic program of autonomous cell death termed apoptosis. Because the p53 tumor suppressor gene is a critical component for induction of apoptosis in response to DNA damage, its inactivation in cancers may be responsible for their resistance to genotoxic anticancer agents. The cellular response to DNA damage involves a cell-cycle arrest at both the G1/S and G2/M transitions; these checkpoints maintain viability by preventing the replication or segregation of damaged DNA. The arrest at the G1 checkpoint is mediated by p53-dependent induction of p21WAF1/CIP1, whereas the G2 arrest involves inactivation of p34cdc2 kinase. Following DNA damage, p53-deficient cells fail to arrest at G1 and accumulate at the G2/M transition. We demonstrate that abrogation of G2 arrest by caffeine-mediated activation of p34cdc2 kinase results in the selective sensitization of p53-deficient primary and tumor cells to irradiation-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that pharmacologic activation of p34cdc2 kinase may be a useful therapeutic strategy for circumventing the resistance of p53-deficient cancers to genotoxic anticancer agents.",

Ligation of CD28 rescued T cells from death, implying that sHLAs induce apoptosis through selective stimulation of the T-cell receptor. CD95-L was upregulated after cytotoxic T lymphocytes were incubated with sHLAs, and cell death was blocked by a neutralizing anti-CD95-L antibody, suggesting that sHLAs induce endogenous mutual killing of activated T cells. These results provide a molecular basis for the capacity of sHLAs to downregulate T-cell responses, which may be especially relevant to organ transplantation.",

In the United States and Europe, carbapenem-resistant strains of the Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 (ref. 5) sequence type are dominant, endemic6-8 and associated with high mortality6,9,10. We report the global evolution of pathogenicity in carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, resulting in the repeated convergence of virulence and carbapenem resistance in the United States and Europe, dating back to as early as 2009. We demonstrate that K. pneumoniae can enhance its pathogenicity by adopting two opposing infection programs through easily acquired gain- and loss-of-function mutations. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the capsule biosynthesis gene wzc lead to hypercapsule production, which confers phagocytosis resistance, enhanced dissemination and increased mortality in animal models. In contrast, mutations disrupting capsule biosynthesis genes impair capsule production, which enhances epithelial cell invasion, in vitro biofilm formation and persistence in urinary tract infections. These two types of capsule mutants have emerged repeatedly and independently in Europe and the United States, with hypercapsule mutants associated with bloodstream infections and capsule-deficient mutants associated with urinary tract infections. In the latter case, drug-tolerant K. pneumoniae can persist to yield potentially untreatable, persistent infection.",

Somatic gene editing by sequence-specific nucleases offers new options for restoring the DMD reading frame, resulting in expression of a shortened but largely functional dystrophin protein. Here, we validated this approach in a pig model of DMD lacking exon 52 of DMD (DMDΔ52), as well as in a corresponding patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell model. In DMDΔ52 pigs1, intramuscular injection of adeno-associated viral vectors of serotype 9 carrying an intein-split Cas9 (ref. 2) and a pair of guide RNAs targeting sequences flanking exon 51 (AAV9-Cas9-gE51) induced expression of a shortened dystrophin (DMDΔ51-52) and improved skeletal muscle function. Moreover, systemic application of AAV9-Cas9-gE51 led to widespread dystrophin expression in muscle, including diaphragm and heart, prolonging survival and reducing arrhythmogenic vulnerability. Similarly, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myoblasts and cardiomyocytes of a patient lacking DMDΔ52, AAV6-Cas9-g51-mediated excision of exon 51 restored dystrophin expression and amelioreate skeletal myotube formation as well as abnormal cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling and arrhythmogenic susceptibility. The ability of Cas9-mediated exon excision to improve DMD pathology in these translational models paves the way for new treatment approaches in patients with this devastating disease.",

Mechanistically, exercise diminishes leptin production in adipose tissue, augmenting quiescence-promoting hematopoietic niche factors in leptin-receptor-positive stromal bone marrow cells. Induced deletion of the leptin receptor in Prrx1-creERT2; Leprfl/fl mice reveals that leptin's effect on bone marrow niche cells regulates hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) proliferation and leukocyte production, as well as cardiovascular inflammation and outcomes. Whereas running wheel withdrawal quickly reverses leptin levels, the impact of exercise on leukocyte production and on the HSPC epigenome and transcriptome persists for several weeks. Together, these data show that physical activity alters HSPCs via modulation of their niche, reducing hematopoietic output of inflammatory leukocytes.",

We show that, to our surprise, suppression of KRAS increased autophagic flux, as did pharmacological inhibition of its effector ERK MAPK. Furthermore, we demonstrate that either KRAS suppression or ERK inhibition decreased both glycolytic and mitochondrial functions. We speculated that ERK inhibition might thus enhance PDAC dependence on autophagy, in part by impairing other KRAS- or ERK-driven metabolic processes. Accordingly, we found that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of specific autophagy regulators synergistically enhanced the ability of ERK inhibitors to mediate antitumor activity in KRAS-driven PDAC. We conclude that combinations of pharmacologic inhibitors that concurrently block both ERK MAPK and autophagic processes that are upregulated in response to ERK inhibition may be effective treatments for PDAC.",

ALK+ lymphomas were accelerated in WASP- and WIP-deficient mice. In the absence of WASP, active GTP-bound CDC42 was increased and the genetic deletion of one CDC42 allele was sufficient to impair lymphoma growth. WASP-deficient lymphoma showed increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation that could be exploited as a therapeutic vulnerability.

        "TEXT": "Although targeted therapies often elicit profound initial patient responses, these effects are transient due to residual disease leading to acquired resistance. How tumors transition between drug responsiveness, tolerance and resistance, especially in the absence of preexisting subclones, remains unclear. In epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cells, we demonstrate that residual disease and acquired resistance in response to EGFR inhibitors requires Aurora kinase A (AURKA) activity. Nongenetic resistance through the activation of AURKA by its coactivator TPX2 emerges in response to chronic EGFR inhibition where it mitigates drug-induced apoptosis. Aurora kinase inhibitors suppress this adaptive survival program, increasing the magnitude and duration of EGFR inhibitor response in preclinical models. Treatment-induced activation of AURKA is associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in vitro, in vivo and in most individuals with EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. These findings delineate a molecular path whereby drug resistance emerges from drug-tolerant cells and unveils a synthetic lethal strategy for enhancing responses to EGFR inhibitors by suppressing AURKA-driven residual disease and acquired resistance.",

OC2 acts as a survival factor in mCRPC models, suppresses the AR transcriptional program by direct regulation of AR target genes and the AR licensing factor FOXA1, and activates genes associated with neural differentiation and progression to lethal disease. OC2 appears active in a substantial subset of human prostate adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors. Inhibition of OC2 by a newly identified small molecule suppresses metastasis in mice.

Herein we report that production of the endogenous peptide apelin, induced by muscle contraction, is reduced in an age-dependent manner in humans and rodents and is positively associated with the beneficial effects of exercise in older persons. Mice deficient in either apelin or its receptor (APLNR) presented dramatic alterations in muscle function with increasing age. Various strategies that restored apelin signaling during aging further demonstrated that this peptide considerably enhanced muscle function by triggering mitochondriogenesis, autophagy and anti-inflammatory pathways in myofibers as well as enhancing the regenerative capacity by targeting muscle stem cells. Taken together, these findings revealed positive regulatory feedback between physical activity, apelin and muscle function and identified apelin both as a tool for diagnosis of early sarcopenia and as the target of an innovative pharmacological strategy to prevent age-associated muscle weakness and restore physical autonomy.",

Cachexia is associated with poor prognosis and accelerated death in patients with cancer, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the metal-ion transporter ZRT- and IRT-like protein 14 (ZIP14) as a critical mediator of cancer-induced cachexia. ZIP14 is upregulated in cachectic muscles of mice and in patients with metastatic cancer and can be induced by TNF-α and TGF-β cytokines. Strikingly, germline ablation or muscle-specific depletion of Zip14 markedly reduces muscle atrophy in metastatic cancer models. We find that ZIP14-mediated zinc uptake in muscle progenitor cells represses the expression of MyoD and Mef2c and blocks muscle-cell differentiation. Importantly, ZIP14-mediated zinc accumulation in differentiated muscle cells induces myosin heavy chain loss. These results highlight a previously unrecognized role for altered zinc homeostasis in metastatic cancer-induced muscle wasting and implicate ZIP14 as a therapeutic target for its treatment.",

However, it remains unknown whether the m6A modification controls the differentiation of normal and/or malignant myeloid hematopoietic cells. Here we show that shRNA-mediated depletion of the m6A-forming enzyme METTL3 in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) promotes cell differentiation, coupled with reduced cell proliferation. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type METTL3, but not of a catalytically inactive form of METTL3, inhibits cell differentiation and increases cell growth. METTL3 mRNA and protein are expressed more abundantly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells than in healthy HSPCs or other types of tumor cells. Furthermore, METTL3 depletion in human myeloid leukemia cell lines induces cell differentiation and apoptosis and delays leukemia progression in recipient mice in vivo. Single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of m6A coupled with ribosome profiling reveals that m6A promotes the translation of c-MYC, BCL2 and PTEN mRNAs in the human acute myeloid leukemia MOLM-13 cell line. Moreover, loss of METTL3 leads to increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which contributes to the differentiation-promoting effects of METTL3 depletion. Overall, these results provide a rationale for the therapeutic targeting of METTL3 in myeloid leukemia.",

Extensive gene and immunohistochemical profiling confirmed that the derived COs represent colon rather than small intestine, containing stem cells, transit-amplifying cells, and the expected spectrum of differentiated cells, including goblet and endocrine cells. We applied this strategy to iPSCs derived from patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP-iPSCs) harboring germline mutations in the WNT-signaling-pathway-regulator gene encoding APC, and we generated COs that exhibit enhanced WNT activity and increased epithelial cell proliferation, which we used as a platform for drug testing. Two potential compounds, XAV939 and rapamycin, decreased proliferation in FAP-COs, but also affected cell proliferation in wild-type COs, which thus limits their therapeutic application. By contrast, we found that geneticin, a ribosome-binding antibiotic with translational 'read-through' activity, efficiently targeted abnormal WNT activity and restored normal proliferation specifically in APC-mutant FAP-COs. These studies provide an efficient strategy for deriving human COs, which can be used in disease modeling and drug discovery for colorectal disease.",

Here, through transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of hematopoietic cells, we reveal that EVI1 overexpression alters cellular metabolism. A screen using pooled short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) identified the ATP-buffering, mitochondrial creatine kinase CKMT1 as necessary for survival of EVI1-expressing cells in subjects with EVI1-positive AML. EVI1 promotes CKMT1 expression by repressing the myeloid differentiation regulator RUNX1. Suppression of arginine-creatine metabolism by CKMT1-directed shRNAs or by the small molecule cyclocreatine selectively decreased the viability, promoted the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of human EVI1-positive cell lines, and prolonged survival in both orthotopic xenograft models and mouse models of primary AML. CKMT1 inhibition altered mitochondrial respiration and ATP production, an effect that was abrogated by phosphocreatine-mediated reactivation of the arginine-creatine pathway. Targeting CKMT1 is thus a promising therapeutic strategy for this EVI1-driven AML subtype that is highly resistant to current treatment regimens.",

Here we identified increased copy number and expression of the PIM1 proto-oncogene in genomic data sets of patients with TNBC. TNBC cells, but not nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells, were dependent on PIM1 for proliferation and protection from apoptosis. PIM1 knockdown reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and dynamic BH3 profiling of apoptotic priming revealed that PIM1 prevents mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in TNBC cell lines. In TNBC tumors and their cellular models, PIM1 expression was associated with several transcriptional signatures involving the transcription factor MYC, and PIM1 depletion in TNBC cell lines decreased, in a MYC-dependent manner, cell population growth and expression of the MYC target gene MCL1. Treatment with the pan-PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 impaired the growth of both cell line and patient-derived xenografts and sensitized them to standard-of-care chemotherapy. This work identifies PIM1 as a malignant-cell-selective target in TNBC and the potential use of PIM1 inhibitors for sensitizing TNBC to chemotherapy-induced apoptotic cell death.",

The senescence effector p16(Ink4a) is expressed in pancreatic beta cells during aging and limits their proliferative potential; however, its effects on beta cell function are poorly characterized. We found that beta cell-specific activation of p16(Ink4a) in transgenic mice enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). In mice with diabetes, this leads to improved glucose homeostasis, providing an unexpected functional benefit. Expression of p16(Ink4a) in beta cells induces hallmarks of senescence--including cell enlargement, and greater glucose uptake and mitochondrial activity--which promote increased insulin secretion. GSIS increases during the normal aging of mice and is driven by elevated p16(Ink4a) activity. We found that islets from human adults contain p16(Ink4a)-expressing senescent beta cells and that senescence induced by p16(Ink4a) in a human beta cell line increases insulin secretion in a manner dependent, in part, on the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ proteins. Our findings reveal a novel role for p16(Ink4a) and cellular senescence in promoting insulin secretion by beta cells and in regulating normal functional tissue maturation with age.",

Although the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a validated drug target for diabetes, the importance of the GIP receptor (GIPR) for the function of beta cells remains uncertain. We demonstrate that mice with selective ablation of GIPR in beta cells (MIP-Cre:Gipr(Flox/Flox); Gipr(-/-βCell)) exhibit lower levels of meal-stimulated insulin secretion, decreased expansion of adipose tissue mass and preservation of insulin sensitivity when compared to MIP-Cre controls. Beta cells from Gipr(-/-βCell) mice display greater sensitivity to apoptosis and markedly lower islet expression of T cell-specific transcription factor-1 (TCF1, encoded by Tcf7), a protein not previously characterized in beta cells. GIP, but not GLP-1, promotes beta cell Tcf7 expression via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-independent and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent pathway. Tcf7 (in mice) or TCF7 (in humans) levels are lower in islets taken from diabetic mice and in humans with type 2 diabetes; knockdown of TCF7 in human and mouse islets impairs the cytoprotective responsiveness to GIP and enhances the magnitude of apoptotic injury, whereas restoring TCF1 levels in beta cells from Gipr(-/-βCell) mice lowers the number of apoptotic cells compared to that seen in MIP-Cre controls. Tcf7(-/-) mice show impaired insulin secretion, deterioration of glucose tolerance with either aging and/or high-fat feeding and increased sensitivity to beta cell injury relative to wild-type (WT) controls. Hence the GIPR-TCF1 axis represents a potential therapeutic target for preserving both the function and survival of vulnerable, diabetic beta cells.",

Moreover, the bone marrow and spleens of individuals with PMF contain large numbers of atypical megakaryocytes that are postulated to contribute to fibrosis through the release of cytokines, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Although the Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib provides symptomatic relief, it does not reduce the mutant allele burden or substantially reverse fibrosis. Here we show through pharmacologic and genetic studies that aurora kinase A (AURKA) represents a new therapeutic target in PMF. Treatment with MLN8237, a selective AURKA inhibitor, promoted polyploidization and differentiation of megakaryocytes with PMF-associated mutations and had potent antifibrotic and antitumor activity in vivo in mouse models of PMF. Moreover, heterozygous deletion of Aurka was sufficient to ameliorate fibrosis and other PMF features in vivo. Our data suggest that megakaryocytes drive fibrosis in PMF and that targeting them with AURKA inhibitors has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit.",

Therefore, selective manipulation of local cytokines is an attractive, although unrealized, therapeutic approach. T cells possess a unique mechanism of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement through the phosphorylation of Tyr323 (pY323). This alternative p38 activation pathway is required for pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Here we show in human PDAC that a high percentage of infiltrating pY323(+) T cells was associated with large numbers of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α- and interleukin (IL)-17-producing CD4(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and aggressive disease. The growth of mouse pancreatic tumors was inhibited by genetic ablation of the alternative p38 pathway, and transfer of wild-type CD4(+) T cells, but not those lacking the alternative pathway, enhanced tumor growth in T cell-deficient mice. Notably, a plasma membrane-permeable peptide derived from GADD45-α, the naturally occurring inhibitor of p38 pY323(+) (ref. 7), reduced CD4(+) TIL production of TNF-α, IL-17A, IL-10 and secondary cytokines, halted growth of implanted tumors and inhibited progression of spontaneous KRAS-driven adenocarcinoma in mice. Thus, TCR-mediated activation of CD4(+) TILs results in alternative p38 activation and production of protumorigenic factors and can be targeted for therapeutic benefit.",

Here we demonstrate that Bap1 loss in mice results in increased trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3), elevated enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (Ezh2) expression, and enhanced repression of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) targets. These findings contrast with the reduction in H3K27me3 levels seen with Asxl1 loss. Conditional deletion of Bap1 and Ezh2 in vivo abrogates the myeloid progenitor expansion induced by Bap1 loss alone. Loss of BAP1 results in a marked decrease in H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1). Consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in the transcriptional regulation of EZH2, expression of SETD8-the H4K20me1 methyltransferase-reduces EZH2 expression and abrogates the proliferation of BAP1-mutant cells. Furthermore, mesothelioma cells that lack BAP1 are sensitive to EZH2 pharmacologic inhibition, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for BAP1-mutant malignancies.",

Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events.",

The absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome is activated by double-stranded DNA, and AIM2 expression is reduced in several types of cancer, but the mechanism by which AIM2 restricts tumor growth remains unclear. We found that Aim2-deficient mice had greater tumor load than Asc-deficient mice in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of colorectal cancer. Tumor burden was also higher in Aim2(-/-)/Apc(Min/+) than in APC(Min/+) mice. The effects of AIM2 on CAC were independent of inflammasome activation and IL-1β and were primarily mediated by a non-bone marrow source of AIM2. In resting cells, AIM2 physically interacted with and limited activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a PI3K-related family member that promotes Akt phosphorylation, whereas loss of AIM2 promoted DNA-PK-mediated Akt activation. AIM2 reduced Akt activation and tumor burden in colorectal cancer models, while an Akt inhibitor reduced tumor load in Aim2(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that Akt inhibitors could be used to treat AIM2-deficient human cancers.",

We found that liver, muscle and adipose tissue exhibit higher levels of the chemotactic eicosanoid LTB4 in obese high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Inhibition of the LTB4 receptor Ltb4r1, through either genetic or pharmacologic loss of function, led to an anti-inflammatory phenotype with protection from insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. In vitro treatment with LTB4 directly enhanced macrophage chemotaxis, stimulated inflammatory pathways, reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myocytes, and impaired insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output in primary mouse hepatocytes. This was accompanied by lower insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and higher Irs-1/2 serine phosphorylation, and all of these events were dependent on Gαi and Jnk1, two downstream mediators of Ltb4r1 signaling. These observations elucidate a novel role of the LTB4-Ltb4r1 signaling pathway in hepatocyte and myocyte insulin resistance, and they show that in vivo inhibition of Ltb4r1 leads to robust insulin-sensitizing effects.",

Our results showed that CH6 facilitated in vitro osteoblast-selective uptake of Plekho1 siRNA, mainly via macropinocytosis, and boosted in vivo osteoblast-specific Plekho1 gene silencing, which promoted bone formation, improved bone microarchitecture, increased bone mass and enhanced mechanical properties in both osteopenic and healthy rodents.

Here we demonstrate that anthracyclines stimulate the rapid production of type I interferons (IFNs) by malignant cells after activation of the endosomal pattern recognition receptor Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). By binding to IFN-α and IFN-β receptors (IFNARs) on neoplastic cells, type I IFNs trigger autocrine and paracrine circuitries that result in the release of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10). Tumors lacking Tlr3 or Ifnar failed to respond to chemotherapy unless type I IFN or Cxcl10, respectively, was artificially supplied. Moreover, a type I IFN-related signature predicted clinical responses to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in several independent cohorts of patients with breast carcinoma characterized by poor prognosis. Our data suggest that anthracycline-mediated immune responses mimic those induced by viral pathogens. We surmise that such 'viral mimicry' constitutes a hallmark of successful chemotherapy.",

All putative niche cells suggested thus far have a nonhematopoietic origin. Thus, it remains unclear how feedback from mature cells is conveyed to HSCs to adjust their proliferation. Here we show that megakaryocytes (MKs) can directly regulate HSC pool size in mice. Three-dimensional whole-mount imaging revealed that endogenous HSCs are frequently located adjacent to MKs in a nonrandom fashion. Selective in vivo depletion of MKs resulted in specific loss of HSC quiescence and led to a marked expansion of functional HSCs. Gene expression analyses revealed that MKs are the source of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 4 (CXCL4, also named platelet factor 4 or PF4) in the bone marrow, and we found that CXCL4 regulates HSC cell cycle activity. CXCL4 injection into mice resulted in a reduced number of HSCs because of their increased quiescence. By contrast, Cxcl4(-/-) mice exhibited an increased number of HSCs and increased HSC proliferation. Combined use of whole-mount imaging and computational modeling was highly suggestive of a megakaryocytic niche capable of independently influencing HSC maintenance by regulating quiescence. These results indicate that a terminally differentiated cell type derived from HSCs contributes to the HSC niche, directly regulating HSC behavior.",

A recent study showed that a specific vessel subtype, strongly positive for CD31 and endomucin (CD31(hi)Emcn(hi)), couples angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Here, we found that platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) secreted by preosteoclasts induces CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessel formation during bone modeling and remodeling. Mice with depletion of PDGF-BB in the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cell lineage show significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone mass, serum and bone marrow PDGF-BB concentrations, and fewer CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessels compared to wild-type mice. In the ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporotic mouse model, serum and bone marrow levels of PDGF-BB and numbers of CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessels are significantly lower compared to sham-operated controls. Treatment with exogenous PDGF-BB or inhibition of cathepsin K to increase the number of preosteoclasts, and thus the endogenous levels of PDGF-BB, increases CD31(hi)Emcn(hi) vessel number and stimulates bone formation in OVX mice. Thus, pharmacotherapies that increase PDGF-BB secretion from preosteoclasts offer a new therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis by promoting angiogenesis and thus bone formation.",

Although demyelination represents a characteristic feature, the clinical phenotype of CMT1A is determined by the degree of axonal loss, and patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness and impaired sensation. CMT1A disease manifests within the first two decades of life, and walking disabilities, foot deformities and electrophysiological abnormalities are already present in childhood. Here, we show in Pmp22-transgenic rodent models of CMT1A that Schwann cells acquire a persistent differentiation defect during early postnatal development, caused by imbalanced activity of the PI3K-Akt and the Mek-Erk signaling pathways. We demonstrate that enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling by axonally overexpressed neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type I drives diseased Schwann cells toward differentiation and preserves peripheral nerve axons. Notably, in a preclinical experimental therapy using a CMT1A rat model, when treatment is restricted to early postnatal development, soluble NRG1 effectively overcomes impaired peripheral nerve development and restores axon survival into adulthood. Our findings suggest a model in which Schwann cell differentiation within a limited time window is crucial for the long-term maintenance of axonal support.",

Genetic alterations driving medulloblastoma initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Herein, we identify GNAS, encoding the G protein Gαs, as a potent tumor suppressor gene that, when expressed at low levels, defines a subset of aggressive Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven human medulloblastomas. Ablation of the single Gnas gene in anatomically distinct progenitors in mice is sufficient to induce Shh-associated medulloblastomas, which recapitulate their human counterparts. Gαs is highly enriched at the primary cilium of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling by regulating both the cAMP-dependent pathway and ciliary trafficking of Hedgehog pathway components. Elevation in levels of a Gαs effector, cAMP, effectively inhibits tumor cell proliferation and progression in Gnas-ablated mice. Thus, our gain- and loss-of-function studies identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function for Gαs that can be found consistently across Shh-group medulloblastomas of disparate cellular and anatomical origins, highlighting G protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue.",

        "TEXT": "The pathophysiology of ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia is poorly understood. We report that RAP-011, an activin receptor IIA (ActRIIA) ligand trap, improved ineffective erythropoiesis, corrected anemia and limited iron overload in a mouse model of β-thalassemia intermedia. Expression of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), an ActRIIA ligand, was increased in splenic erythroblasts from thalassemic mice and in erythroblasts and sera from subjects with β-thalassemia. Inactivation of GDF11 decreased oxidative stress and the amount of α-globin membrane precipitates, resulting in increased terminal erythroid differentiation. Abnormal GDF11 expression was dependent on reactive oxygen species, suggesting the existence of an autocrine amplification loop in β-thalassemia. GDF11 inactivation also corrected the abnormal ratio of immature/mature erythroblasts by inducing apoptosis of immature erythroblasts through the Fas-Fas ligand pathway. Taken together, these observations suggest that ActRIIA ligand traps may have therapeutic relevance in β-thalassemia by suppressing the deleterious effects of GDF11, a cytokine which blocks terminal erythroid maturation through an autocrine amplification loop involving oxidative stress and α-globin precipitation.",

However, targeted mutation of either gene in mice leads to only slow and infrequent development of malignant lymphoma, and despite frequent mutation of BCL6 in activated B cells of healthy individuals, lymphoma development is rare. Here we show that T cells prevent the development of overt lymphoma in mice caused by Blimp1 deficiency or overexpression of Bcl6 in the B cell lineage. Impairment of T cell control results in rapid development of DLBCL-like disease, which can be eradicated by polyclonal CD8(+) T cells in a T cell receptor-, CD28- and Fas ligand-dependent manner. Thus, malignant transformation of mature B cells requires mutations that impair intrinsic differentiation processes and permit escape from T cell-mediated tumor surveillance.",

Evidence from xenograft models and human trials indicates selective enrichment of cancer-initiating cells (CICs) in tumors that survive therapy. Together with recent reports showing that CIC gene signatures influence patient survival, these studies predict that targeting self-renewal, the key 'stemness' property unique to CICs, may represent a new paradigm in cancer therapy. Here we demonstrate that tumor formation and, more specifically, human colorectal CIC function are dependent on the canonical self-renewal regulator BMI-1. Downregulation of BMI-1 inhibits the ability of colorectal CICs to self-renew, resulting in the abrogation of their tumorigenic potential. Treatment of primary colorectal cancer xenografts with a small-molecule BMI-1 inhibitor resulted in colorectal CIC loss with long-term and irreversible impairment of tumor growth. Targeting the BMI-1-related self-renewal machinery provides the basis for a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of colorectal cancer.",

Targeting the niche is a new strategy to eliminate persistent and drug-resistant LSCs. CD44 (refs. 3,4) and interleukin-6 (ref. 5) have been implicated previously in the LSC niche. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is released during bone remodeling and plays a part in maintenance of CML LSCs, but a role for TGF-β1 from the BMM has not been defined. Here, we show that alteration of the BMM by osteoblastic cell-specific activation of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor attenuates BCR-ABL1 oncogene-induced CML-like myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) but enhances MLL-AF9 oncogene-induced AML in mouse transplantation models, possibly through opposing effects of increased TGF-β1 on the respective LSCs. PTH treatment caused a 15-fold decrease in LSCs in wild-type mice with CML-like MPN and reduced engraftment of immune-deficient mice with primary human CML cells. These results demonstrate that LSC niches in CML and AML are distinct and suggest that modulation of the BMM by PTH may be a feasible strategy to reduce LSCs, a prerequisite for the cure of CML.",

However, it is not known whether inhibiting PI3K represents a selective and effective approach for treatment. We interrogated large databases and found that sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is activated in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma. We demonstrate that the SHH and PI3K pathways synergize to promote tumor growth and viability in human PTEN-deficient glioblastomas. A combination of PI3K and SHH signaling inhibitors not only suppressed the activation of both pathways but also abrogated S6 kinase (S6K) signaling. Accordingly, targeting both pathways simultaneously resulted in mitotic catastrophe and tumor apoptosis and markedly reduced the growth of PTEN-deficient glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo. The drugs tested here appear to be safe in humans; therefore, this combination may provide a new targeted treatment for glioblastoma.",

Here we show that Bach2-mediated activation of p53 is required for stringent elimination of pre-B cells that failed to productively rearrange immunoglobulin VH-DJH gene segments. After productive VH-DJH gene rearrangement, pre-B cell receptor signaling ends BACH2-mediated negative selection through B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6)-mediated repression of p53. In patients with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the BACH2-mediated checkpoint control is compromised by deletions, rare somatic mutations and loss of its upstream activator, PAX5. Low levels of BACH2 expression in these patients represent a strong independent predictor of poor clinical outcome. In this study, we demonstrate that Bach2(+/+) pre-B cells resist leukemic transformation by Myc through Bach2-dependent upregulation of p53 and do not initiate fatal leukemia in transplant-recipient mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and gene expression analyses carried out by us revealed that BACH2 competes with BCL6 for promoter binding and reverses BCL6-mediated repression of p53 and other cell cycle checkpoint-control genes. These findings identify BACH2 as a crucial mediator of negative selection at the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint and a safeguard against leukemogenesis.",

Recent identification of signaling cascades deregulated in ADPKD has led to the initiation of several clinical trials, but an approved therapy is still lacking. Using a metabolomic approach, we identify a pathogenic pathway in this disease that can be safely targeted for therapy. We show that mutation of PKD1 results in enhanced glycolysis in cells in a mouse model of PKD and in kidneys from humans with ADPKD. Glucose deprivation resulted in lower proliferation and higher apoptotic rates in PKD1-mutant cells than in nondeprived cells. Notably, two distinct PKD mouse models treated with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), to inhibit glycolysis, had lower kidney weight, volume, cystic index and proliferation rates as compared to nontreated mice. These metabolic alterations depend on the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway acting in a dual manner by inhibiting the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis on the one hand while activating the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)-glycolytic cascade on the other. Enhanced metabolic rates further inhibit AMPK. Forced activation of AMPK acts in a negative feedback loop, restoring normal ERK activity. Taken together, these data indicate that defective glucose metabolism is intimately involved in the pathobiology of ADPKD. Our findings provide a strong rationale for a new therapeutic strategy using existing drugs, either individually or in combination.",

Because direct pharmacological inhibition of the RAS proto-oncogene has thus far been unsuccessful, we explored systems biology approaches to identify synergistic drug combination(s) that can mimic RAS inhibition. Here, leveraging an inducible mouse model of NRAS-mutant melanoma, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) activates apoptosis but not cell-cycle arrest, which is in contrast to complete genetic neuroblastoma RAS homolog (NRAS) extinction, which triggers both of these effects. Network modeling pinpointed cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) as a key driver of this differential phenotype. Accordingly, combined pharmacological inhibition of MEK and CDK4 in vivo led to substantial synergy in therapeutic efficacy. We suggest a gradient model of oncogenic NRAS signaling in which the output is gated, resulting in the decoupling of discrete downstream biological phenotypes as a result of incomplete inhibition. Such a gated signaling model offers a new framework to identify nonobvious coextinction target(s) for combined pharmacological inhibition in NRAS-mutant melanomas.",

We have found that loss of PPAR-δ or inhibition of mitochondrial FAO induces loss of HSC maintenance, whereas treatment with PPAR-δ agonists improved HSC maintenance. PML exerts its essential role in HSC maintenance through regulation of PPAR signaling and FAO. Mechanistically, the PML–PPAR-δ–FAO pathway controls the asymmetric division of HSCs. Deletion of Ppard or Pml as well as inhibition of FAO results in the symmetric commitment of HSC daughter cells, whereas PPAR-δ activation increased asymmetric cell division.

        "TEXT": "The inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which often occurs through mutations in TP53 (encoding tumor protein 53) is a common step in human cancer. However, in melanoma-a highly chemotherapy-resistant disease-TP53 mutations are rare, raising the possibility that this cancer uses alternative ways to overcome p53-mediated tumor suppression. Here we show that Mdm4 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM4), a negative regulator of p53, is upregulated in a substantial proportion (∼65%) of stage I-IV human melanomas and that melanocyte-specific Mdm4 overexpression enhanced tumorigenesis in a mouse model of melanoma induced by the oncogene Nras. MDM4 promotes the survival of human metastatic melanoma by antagonizing p53 proapoptotic function. Notably, inhibition of the MDM4-p53 interaction restored p53 function in melanoma cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy and to inhibitors of the BRAF (V600E) oncogene. Our results identify MDM4 as a key determinant of impaired p53 function in human melanoma and designate MDM4 as a promising target for antimelanoma combination therapy.",

By comparing the transcriptomes of primary and metastatic tumor cells in a mouse model of spontaneous bone metastasis, we found that a substantial number of genes suppressed in bone metastases are targets of the interferon regulatory factor Irf7. Restoration of Irf7 in tumor cells or administration of interferon led to reduced bone metastases and prolonged survival time. In mice deficient in the interferon (IFN) receptor or in natural killer (NK) and CD8(+) T cell responses, metastasis was accelerated, indicating that Irf7-driven suppression of metastasis was reliant on IFN signaling to host immune cells. We confirmed the clinical relevance of these findings in over 800 patients in which high expression of Irf7-regulated genes in primary tumors was associated with prolonged bone metastasis-free survival. This gene signature may identify patients that could benefit from IFN-based therapies. Thus, we have identified an innate immune pathway intrinsic to breast cancer cells, the suppression of which restricts immunosurveillance to enable metastasis.",

Using a rat model of complex febrile seizures, which are thought to be a precipitating insult of TLE later in life, we report that aberrant migration of neonatal-generated granule cells results in granule cell ectopia that persists into adulthood. Febrile seizures induced an upregulation of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) in neonatally generated granule cells, and hyperactivation of excitatory GABA(A)-Rs caused a reversal in the direction of granule cell migration. This abnormal migration was prevented by RNAi-mediated knockdown of the Na(+)K(+)2Cl(-) co-transporter (NKCC1), which regulates the excitatory action of GABA. NKCC1 inhibition with bumetanide after febrile seizures rescued the granule cell ectopia, susceptibility to limbic seizures and development of epilepsy. Thus, this work identifies a previously unknown pathogenic role of excitatory GABA(A)-R signaling and highlights NKCC1 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing granule cell ectopia and the development of epilepsy after febrile seizures.",

Il9r(-/-) mice showed accelerated tumor growth, and administration of recombinant IL-9 (rIL-9) to tumor-bearing WT and Rag1(-/-) mice inhibited melanoma as well as lung carcinoma growth. Adoptive transfer of tumor-antigen-specific T(H)9 cells into both WT and Rag1(-/-) mice suppressed melanoma growth; this effect was abrogated by treatment with neutralizing antibodies to IL-9. Exogenous rIL-9 inhibited tumor growth in Rag1(-/-) mice but not in mast-cell-deficient mice, suggesting that the targets of IL-9 in this setting include mast cells but not T or B cells. In addition, we found higher numbers of T(H)9 cells in normal human skin and blood compared to metastatic lesions of subjects with progressive stage IV melanoma.

We now report that IGF-1 released from the bone matrix during bone remodeling stimulates osteoblastic differentiation of recruited mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thus maintaining proper bone microarchitecture and mass. Mice with knockout of the IGF-1 receptor (Igf1r) in their pre-osteoblastic cells showed lower bone mass and mineral deposition rates than wild-type mice. Further, MSCs from Igf1rflox/flox mice with Igf1r deleted by a Cre adenovirus in vitro, although recruited to the bone surface after implantation, were unable to differentiate into osteoblasts. We also found that the concentrations of IGF-1 in the bone matrix and marrow of aged rats were lower than in those of young rats and directly correlated with the age-related decrease in bone mass. Likewise, in age-related osteoporosis in humans, we found that bone marrow IGF-1 concentrations were 40% lower in individuals with osteoporosis than in individuals without osteoporosis. Notably, injection of IGF-1 plus IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), but not injection of IGF-1 alone, increased the concentration of IGF-1 in the bone matrix and stimulated new bone formation in aged rats. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how IGF-1 maintains adult bone mass, while also providing a further rationale for its therapeutic targeting to treat age-related osteoporosis.",

We explored the function of melanoma-derived exosomes in the formation of primary tumors and metastases in mice and human subjects. Exosomes from highly metastatic melanomas increased the metastatic behavior of primary tumors by permanently 'educating' bone marrow progenitors through the receptor tyrosine kinase MET. Melanoma-derived exosomes also induced vascular leakiness at pre-metastatic sites and reprogrammed bone marrow progenitors toward a pro-vasculogenic phenotype that was positive for c-Kit, the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 and Met. Reducing Met expression in exosomes diminished the pro-metastatic behavior of bone marrow cells. Notably, MET expression was elevated in circulating CD45(-)C-KIT(low/+)TIE2(+) bone marrow progenitors from individuals with metastatic melanoma. RAB1A, RAB5B, RAB7 and RAB27A, regulators of membrane trafficking and exosome formation, were highly expressed in melanoma cells. Rab27A RNA interference decreased exosome production, preventing bone marrow education and reducing, tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, we identified an exosome-specific melanoma signature with prognostic and therapeutic potential comprised of TYRP2, VLA-4, HSP70, an HSP90 isoform and the MET oncoprotein. Our data show that exosome production, transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis, has prognostic value and offers promise for new therapeutic directions in the metastatic process.",

We show a fundamental role for Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) in these processes in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and triple-negative breast cancers. Knockdown of SHP2 eradicated breast tumor-initiating cells in xenograft models, and SHP2 depletion also prevented invasion in three-dimensional cultures and in a transductal invasion assay in vivo. Notably, SHP2 knockdown in established breast tumors blocked their growth and reduced metastasis. Mechanistically, SHP2 activated stemness-associated transcription factors, including v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc) and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), which resulted in the repression of let-7 microRNA and the expression of a set of 'SHP2 signature' genes. We found these genes to be simultaneously activated in a large subset of human primary breast tumors that are associated with invasive behavior and poor prognosis. These results provide new insights into the signaling cascades influencing tumor-initiating cells as well as a rationale for targeting SHP2 in breast cancer.",

Here we report a negative feedback loop between P53 and TCTP. TCTP promotes P53 degradation by competing with NUMB for binding to P53-MDM2-containing complexes. TCTP inhibits MDM2 auto-ubiquitination and promotes MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of P53. Notably, Tctp haploinsufficient mice are sensitized to P53-dependent apoptosis. In addition, P53 directly represses TCTP transcription. In 508 breast cancers, high-TCTP status associates with poorly differentiated, aggressive G3-grade tumors, predicting poor prognosis (P < 0.0005). Tctp knockdown in primary mammary tumor cells from ErbB2 transgenic mice results in increased P53 expression and a decreased number of stem-like cancer cells. The pharmacological compounds sertraline and thioridazine increase the amount of P53 by neutralizing TCTP's action on the MDM2-P53 axis. This study links TCTP and P53 in a previously unidentified regulatory circuitry that may underlie the relevance of TCTP in cancer.",

        "TEXT": "The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling system contributes to tumor angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. Here we show in mouse tumor models that PDGF-BB induces erythropoietin (EPO) mRNA and protein expression by targeting stromal and perivascular cells that express PDGF receptor-β (PDGFR-β). Tumor-derived PDGF-BB promoted tumor growth, angiogenesis and extramedullary hematopoiesis at least in part through modulation of EPO expression. Moreover, adenoviral delivery of PDGF-BB to tumor-free mice increased both EPO production and erythropoiesis, as well as protecting from irradiation-induced anemia. At the molecular level, we show that the PDGF-BB-PDGFR-bβ signaling system activates the EPO promoter, acting in part through transcriptional regulation by the transcription factor Atf3, possibly through its association with two additional transcription factors, c-Jun and Sp1. Our findings suggest that PDGF-BB-induced EPO promotes tumor growth through two mechanisms: first, paracrine stimulation of tumor angiogenesis by direct induction of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, sprouting and tube formation, and second, endocrine stimulation of extramedullary hematopoiesis leading to increased oxygen perfusion and protection against tumor-associated anemia.",

        "TEXT": "Previous studies have proposed roles for hypothalamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the modulation of circuit activity of the melanocortin system. Here we show that suppression of ROS diminishes pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cell activation and promotes the activity of neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-co-producing (NPY/AgRP) neurons and feeding, whereas ROS-activates POMC neurons and reduces feeding. The levels of ROS in POMC neurons were positively correlated with those of leptin in lean and ob/ob mice, a relationship that was diminished in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. High-fat feeding resulted in proliferation of peroxisomes and elevated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) mRNA levels within the hypothalamus. The proliferation of peroxisomes in POMC neurons induced by the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone decreased ROS levels and increased food intake in lean mice on high-fat diet. Conversely, the suppression of peroxisome proliferation by the PPAR antagonist GW9662 increased ROS concentrations and c-fos expression in POMC neurons. Also, it reversed high-fat feeding-triggered elevated NPY/AgRP and low POMC neuronal firing, and resulted in decreased feeding of DIO mice. Finally, central administration of ROS alone increased c-fos and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pStat3) expression in POMC neurons and reduced feeding of DIO mice. These observations unmask a previously unknown hypothalamic cellular process associated with peroxisomes and ROS in the central regulation of energy metabolism in states of leptin resistance.",

Here we show that death receptor 6 (DR6) is a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte maturation. DR6 is expressed strongly in immature oligodendrocytes and weakly in mature myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive oligodendrocytes. Overexpression of DR6 in oligodendrocytes leads to caspase 3 (casp3) activation and cell death. Attenuation of DR6 function leads to enhanced oligodendrocyte maturation, myelination and downregulation of casp3. Treatment with a DR6 antagonist antibody promotes remyelination in both lysolecithin-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. Consistent with the DR6 antagoinst antibody studies, DR6-null mice show enhanced remyelination in both demyelination models. These studies reveal a pivotal role for DR6 signaling in immature oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination that may provide new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of demyelination disorders such as multiple sclerosis.",

To investigate Joubert syndrome pathogenesis, we have examined mice with mutated Ahi1, the first identified Joubert syndrome-associated gene. These mice show cerebellar hypoplasia with a vermis-midline fusion defect early in development. This defect is concomitant with expansion of the roof plate and is also evident in a mouse mutant for another Joubert syndrome-associated gene, Cep290. Furthermore, fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of human subjects with Joubert syndrome reveals a similar midline cleft, suggesting parallel pathogenic mechanisms. Previous evidence has suggested a role for Jouberin (Jbn), the protein encoded by Ahi1, in canonical Wnt signaling. Consistent with this, we found decreased Wnt reporter activity at the site of hemisphere fusion in the developing cerebellum of Ahi1-mutant mice. This decrease was accompanied by reduced proliferation at the site of fusion. Finally, treatment with lithium, a Wnt pathway agonist, partially rescued this phenotype. Our findings implicate a defect in Wnt signaling in the cerebellar midline phenotype seen in Joubert syndrome that can be overcome with Wnt stimulation.",

However, large numbers of women relapse, highlighting the need for the discovery of new regulatory targets modulating ERα pathways. An siRNA screen identified kinases whose silencing alters the estrogen response including those previously implicated in regulating ERα activity (such as mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT). Among the most potent regulators was lemur tyrosine kinase-3 (LMTK3), for which a role has not previously been assigned. In contrast to other modulators of ERα activity, LMTK3 seems to have been subject to Darwinian positive selection, a noteworthy result given the unique susceptibility of humans to ERα+ breast cancer. LMTK3 acts by decreasing the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) and the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), thereby increasing binding of forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) to the ESR1 promoter. LMTK3 phosphorylated ERα, protecting it from proteasomal degradation in vitro. Silencing of LMTK3 reduced tumor volume in an orthotopic mouse model and abrogated proliferation of ERα+ but not ERα- cells, indicative of its role in ERα activity. In human cancers, LMTK3 abundance and intronic polymorphisms were significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival and predicted response to endocrine therapies. These findings yield insights into the natural history of breast cancer in humans and reveal LMTK3 as a new therapeutic target.",

Here we show that transgenic expression of human TLX1 in mice induces T-ALL with frequent deletions and mutations in Bcl11b (encoding B cell leukemia/lymphoma-11B) and identify the presence of recurrent mutations and deletions in BCL11B in 16% of human T-ALLs. Most notably, mouse TLX1 tumors were typically aneuploid and showed a marked defect in the activation of the mitotic checkpoint. Mechanistically, TLX1 directly downregulates the expression of CHEK1 (encoding CHK1 checkpoint homolog) and additional mitotic control genes and induces loss of the mitotic checkpoint in nontransformed preleukemic thymocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to chromosomal missegregation and aneuploidy active at the earliest stages of tumor development in the pathogenesis of cancer.",

Activation of ERK (extracellular signal-related kinase) phosphorylates c-Myc, preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Accordingly, Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) mice have lower phospho-ERK (p-ERK) levels and fewer and smaller IEC tumors than Apc(min/+) mice. MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88)-independent activation of ERK by epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased p-ERK and c-Myc and restored the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) phenotype in Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) mice. Administration of an ERK inhibitor suppressed intestinal tumorigenesis in EGF-treated Apc(min/+)/Myd88(-/-) and Apc(min/+) mice and increased their survival.

Cancer stem cell eradication is thought to be crucial for successful anticancer therapy. Using an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model induced by the leukemia-associated monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ)-TIF2 fusion protein, we show here that AML can be cured by the ablation of leukemia stem cells. The MOZ fusion proteins MOZ-TIF2 and MOZ-CBP interacted with the transcription factor PU.1 to stimulate the expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF1R, also known as M-CSFR, c-FMS or CD115). Studies using PU.1-deficient mice showed that PU.1 is essential for the ability of MOZ-TIF2 to establish and maintain AML stem cells. Cells expressing high amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(high) cells), but not those expressing low amounts of CSF1R (CSF1R(low) cells), showed potent leukemia-initiating activity. Using transgenic mice expressing a drug-inducible suicide gene controlled by the CSF1R promoter, we cured AML by ablation of CSF1R(high) cells. Moreover, induction of AML was suppressed in CSF1R-deficient mice and CSF1R inhibitors slowed the progression of MOZ-TIF2-induced leukemia. Thus, in this subtype of AML, leukemia stem cells are contained within the CSF1R(high) cell population, and we suggest that targeting of PU.1-mediated upregulation of CSF1R expression might be a useful therapeutic approach.",

Here we report that human and mouse tumors produce LXR ligands that inhibit CCR7 expression on maturing DCs and, therefore, their migration to lymphoid organs. In agreement with this observation, we detected CD83(+)CCR7(-) DCs within human tumors. Mice injected with tumors expressing the LXR ligand-inactivating enzyme sulfotransferase 2B1b (SULT2B1b) successfully controlled tumor growth by regaining DC migration to tumor-draining lymph nodes and by developing overt inflammation within tumors. The control of tumor growth was also observed in chimeric mice transplanted with bone marrow from mice lacking the gene encoding LXR-alpha (Nr1h3(-/-) mice) Thus, we show a new mechanism of tumor immunoescape involving products of cholesterol metabolism.

We found that endogenous Hsp90 interacts with BCL-6 in DLBCL cells and can stabilize BCL-6 mRNA and protein. Hsp90 formed a complex with BCL-6 at its target promoters, and Hsp90 inhibitors derepressed BCL-6 target genes. A stable mutant of BCL-6 rescued DLBCL cells from Hsp90 inhibitor-induced apoptosis. BCL-6 and Hsp90 were almost invariantly coexpressed in the nuclei of primary DLBCL cells, suggesting that their interaction is relevant in this disease. We examined the pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy of PU-H71, a recently developed purine-derived Hsp90 inhibitor. PU-H71 preferentially accumulated in lymphomas compared to normal tissues and selectively suppressed BCL-6-dependent DLBCLs in vivo, inducing reactivation of key BCL-6 target genes and apoptosis. PU-H71 also induced cell death in primary human DLBCL specimens.",

We report that the human epilepsy gene LGI1, encoding leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated protein-1 and mutated in autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy (ADLTE), mediates this process in hippocampus. We created transgenic mice either expressing a truncated mutant LGI1 (835delC) found in ADLTE or overexpressing a wild-type LGI1. We discovered that the normal postnatal maturation of presynaptic and postsynaptic functions was arrested by the 835delC mutant LGI1, and contrastingly, was magnified by excess wild-type LGI1. Concurrently, mutant LGI1 inhibited dendritic pruning and increased the spine density to markedly increase excitatory synaptic transmission. Inhibitory transmission, by contrast, was unaffected. Furthermore, mutant LGI1 promoted epileptiform discharge in vitro and kindling epileptogenesis in vivo with partial gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor blockade. Thus, LGI1 represents a human gene mutated to promote epilepsy through impaired postnatal development of glutamatergic circuits.",

Affected individuals harbor conserved mutations in the ACVR1 gene that are thought to cause constitutive activation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor, activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2). Here we show that intramuscular expression in the mouse of an inducible transgene encoding constitutively active ALK2 (caALK2), resulting from a glutamine to aspartic acid change at amino acid position 207, leads to ectopic endochondral bone formation, joint fusion and functional impairment, thus phenocopying key aspects of human FOP. A selective inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, LDN-193189 (ref. 6), inhibits activation of the BMP signaling effectors SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 in tissues expressing caALK2 induced by adenovirus specifying Cre (Ad.Cre). This treatment resulted in a reduction in ectopic ossification and functional impairment. In contrast to localized induction of caALK2 by Ad.Cre (which entails inflammation), global postnatal expression of caALK2 (induced without the use of Ad.Cre and thus without inflammation) does not lead to ectopic ossification. However, if in this context an inflammatory stimulus was provided with a control adenovirus, ectopic bone formation was induced. Like LDN-193189, corticosteroid inhibits ossification in Ad.Cre-injected mutant mice, suggesting caALK2 expression and an inflammatory milieu are both required for the development of ectopic ossification in this model. These results support the role of dysregulated ALK2 kinase activity in the pathogenesis of FOP and suggest that small molecule inhibition of BMP type I receptor activity may be useful in treating FOP and heterotopic ossification syndromes associated with excessive BMP signaling.",

To understand the regulatory network underlying docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cells and to identify molecular targets for therapy, we tested small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against 36 genes whose expression was elevated in human nonresponders to docetaxel for the ability to promote apoptosis of docetaxel-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF7-ADR cells). The results indicate that the downregulation of the gene encoding ribophorin [corrected] II (RPN2), which is part of an N-oligosaccharyl transferase complex, most efficiently induces apoptosis of MCF7-ADR cells in the presence of docetaxel. RPN2 silencing induced reduced glycosylation of the P-glycoprotein, as well as decreased membrane localization, thereby sensitizing MCF7-ADR cells to docetaxel. Moreover, in vivo delivery of siRNA specific for RPN2 markedly reduced tumor growth in two types of models for drug resistance. Thus, RPN2 silencing makes cancer cells hypersensitive response to docetaxel, and RPN2 might be a new target for RNA interference-based therapeutics against drug resistance.",

However, its in vivo function during mesenchymal cell differentiation, and, specifically, in bone homeostasis, remains largely unknown. Here, we show that osteoblast-specific gain of Notch function causes severe osteosclerosis owing to increased proliferation of immature osteoblasts. Under these pathological conditions, Notch stimulates early osteoblastic proliferation by upregulating the genes encoding cyclin D, cyclin E and Sp7 (osterix). The intracellular domain of Notch1 also regulates terminal osteoblastic differentiation by directly binding Runx2 and repressing its transactivation function. In contrast, loss of all Notch signaling in osteoblasts, generated by deletion of the genes encoding presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 in bone, is associated with late-onset, age-related osteoporosis, which in turn results from increased osteoblast-dependent osteoclastic activity due to decreased osteoprotegerin mRNA expression in these cells. Together, these findings highlight the potential dimorphic effects of Notch signaling in bone homeostasis and may provide direction for novel therapeutic applications.",

Here we describe the use of foamy virus vectors to treat canine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD). Four of five dogs with CLAD that received nonmyeloablative conditioning and infusion of autologous, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced by a foamy virus vector expressing canine CD18 had complete reversal of the CLAD phenotype, which was sustained more than 2 years after infusion. In vitro assays showed correction of the lymphocyte proliferation and neutrophil adhesion defects that characterize CLAD. There were no genotoxic complications, and integration site analysis showed polyclonality of transduced cells and a decreased risk of integration near oncogenes as compared to gammaretroviral vectors. These results represent the first successful use of a foamy virus vector to treat a genetic disease, to our knowledge, and suggest that foamy virus vectors will be effective in treating human hematopoietic diseases.",

Mice lacking uPAR (Plaur-/-) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active beta3 integrin. Gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for uPAR expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of LPS-mediated proteinuria. Mechanistically, uPAR is required to activate alphavbeta3 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Blockade of alphavbeta3 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. Our findings show a physiological role for uPAR signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability.",

        "TEXT": "Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality from cancer, but the mechanisms leading to metastasis are poorly understood. In particular, relatively little is known about metastasis in cancers of mesenchymal origins, which are known as sarcomas. Approximately ten proteins have been characterized as 'metastasis suppressors', but how these proteins function and are regulated is, in general, not well understood. Gp78 (also known as AMFR or RNF45) is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that is integral to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of diverse substrates. Here we report that expression of gp78 has a causal role in the metastasis of an aggressive human sarcoma and that this prometastatic activity requires the E3 activity of gp78. Further, gp78 associates with and targets the transmembrane metastasis suppressor, KAI1 (also known as CD82), for degradation. Suppression of gp78 increases KAI1 abundance and reduces the metastatic potential of tumor cells, an effect that is largely blocked by concomitant suppression of KAI1. An inverse relationship between these proteins was confirmed in a human sarcoma tissue microarray. Whereas most previous efforts have focused on genetic mechanisms for the loss of metastasis suppressor genes, our results provide new evidence for post-translational downregulation of a metastasis suppressor by its ubiquitin ligase, resulting in abrogation of its metastasis-suppressing effects.",

To explore mechanisms of sarcoma pathogenesis, we have generated a mouse model of soft tissue sarcoma. Intramuscular delivery of an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase in mice with conditional mutations in Kras and Trp53 was sufficient to initiate high-grade sarcomas with myofibroblastic differentiation. Like human sarcomas, these tumors show a predilection for lung rather than lymph node metastasis. Using this model, we showed that a prototype handheld imaging device can identify residual tumor during intraoperative molecular imaging. Deletion of the Ink4a-Arf locus (Cdkn2a), but not Bak1 and Bax, could substitute for mutation of Trp53 in this model. Deletion of Bak1 and Bax, however, was able to substitute for mutation of Trp53 in the development of sinonasal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis seems sufficient to mediate p53 tumor suppression in an epithelial cancer, but not in this model of soft tissue sarcoma.",

We examined the effects of CDK1 inhibition in the context of different oncogenic signals. Cells transformed with MYC, but not cells transformed by a panel of other activated oncogenes, rapidly underwent apoptosis when treated with small-molecule CDK1 inhibitors. The inhibitor of apoptosis protein BIRC5 (survivin), a known CDK1 target, is required for the survival of cells overexpressing MYC. Inhibition of CDK1 rapidly downregulates survivin expression and induces MYC-dependent apoptosis. CDK1 inhibitor treatment of MYC-dependent mouse lymphoma and hepatoblastoma tumors decreased tumor growth and prolonged their survival. As there are no effective small-molecule inhibitors that selectively target the MYC pathway, we propose that CDK1 inhibition might therefore be useful in the treatment of human malignancies that overexpress MYC.",

This report establishes the direct participation of mast cells in atherogenesis in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient (Ldlr(-/-)) mice. Atheromata from compound mutant Ldlr(-/-) Kit(W-sh)(/W-sh) mice showed decreased lesion size, lipid deposition, T-cell and macrophage numbers, cell proliferation and apoptosis, but increased collagen content and fibrous cap development. In vivo, adoptive transfer of syngeneic wild-type or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-deficient mast cells restored atherogenesis to Ldlr(-/-)Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice. Notably, neither interleukin (IL)-6- nor interferon (IFN)-gamma-deficient mast cells did so, indicating that the inhibition of atherogenesis in Ldlr(-/-)Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice resulted from the absence of mast cells and mast cell-derived IL-6 and IFN-gamma. Compared with wild-type or TNF-alpha-deficient mast cells, those lacking IL-6 or IFN-gamma did not induce expression of proatherogenic cysteine proteinase cathepsins from vascular cells in vitro or affect cathepsin and matrix metalloproteinase activities in atherosclerotic lesions, implying that mast cell-derived IL-6 and IFN-gamma promote atherogenesis by augmenting the expression of matrix-degrading proteases. These observations establish direct participation of mast cells and mast cell-derived IL-6 and IFN-gamma in mouse atherogenesis and provide new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of this common disease.",

In the T-cell lineage, calcineurin activation is important for pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TCR-mediated positive selection of thymocytes into mature T cells, and many aspects of the immune response. The critical role of calcineurin in the immune response is underscored by the fact that calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, are powerful immunosuppressants in wide clinical use. We observed sustained calcineurin activation in human B- and T-cell lymphomas and in all mouse models of lymphoid malignancies analyzed. In intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1)- and TEL-JAK2-induced T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, two mouse models relevant to human malignancies, in vivo inhibition of calcineurin activity by CsA or FK506 induced apoptosis of leukemic cells and rapid tumor clearance, and substantially prolonged mouse survival. In contrast, ectopic expression of a constitutively activated mutant of calcineurin favored leukemia progression. Moreover, CsA treatment induced apoptosis in human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Thus, calcineurin activation is critical for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype in vivo, identifying this pathway as a relevant therapeutic target in lymphoid malignancies.",

Moreover, the dysfunctional environment limited the engraftment of transplanted wild-type hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Dysfunction of the hematopoietic environment was age dependent and correlated with progressive telomere shortening in bone marrow stromal cells. Telomere dysfunction impaired mesenchymal progenitor cell function, reduced the capacity of bone marrow stromal cells to maintain functional HSCs, and increased the expression of various cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), in the plasma of aging mice. Administration of G-CSF to wild-type mice mimicked some of the defects seen in aging Terc(-/-) mice, including impairment of B lymphopoiesis and HSC engraftment. Conversely, inhibition of G-CSF improved HSC engraftment in aged Terc(-/-) mice.

MIF triggered G(alphai)- and integrin-dependent arrest and chemotaxis of monocytes and T cells, rapid integrin activation and calcium influx through CXCR2 or CXCR4. MIF competed with cognate ligands for CXCR4 and CXCR2 binding, and directly bound to CXCR2. CXCR2 and CD74 formed a receptor complex, and monocyte arrest elicited by MIF in inflamed or atherosclerotic arteries involved both CXCR2 and CD74. In vivo, Mif deficiency impaired monocyte adhesion to the arterial wall in atherosclerosis-prone mice, and MIF-induced leukocyte recruitment required Il8rb (which encodes Cxcr2). Blockade of Mif but not of canonical ligands of Cxcr2 or Cxcr4 in mice with advanced atherosclerosis led to plaque regression and reduced monocyte and T-cell content in plaques. By activating both CXCR2 and CXCR4, MIF displays chemokine-like functions and acts as a major regulator of inflammatory cell recruitment and atherogenesis. Targeting MIF in individuals with manifest atherosclerosis can potentially be used to treat this condition.",

Cu(2+) induced the secretion of activated Asm from leukocytes, leading to ceramide release in and phosphatidylserine exposure on erythrocytes, events also prevented by inhibition of Asm. Phosphatidylserine exposure resulted in immediate clearance of affected erythrocytes from the blood in mice. Accordingly, individuals with Wilson disease showed elevated plasma levels of Asm, and displayed a constitutive increase of ceramide- and phosphatidylserine-positive erythrocytes.

Here we show that CD44 expression is increased on mouse stem-progenitor cells expressing BCR-ABL and that CD44 contributes functional E-selectin ligands. In a mouse retroviral transplantation model of CML, BCR-ABL1-transduced progenitors from CD44-mutant donors are defective in homing to recipient marrow, resulting in decreased engraftment and impaired induction of CML-like myeloproliferative disease. By contrast, CD44-deficient stem cells transduced with empty retrovirus engraft as efficiently as do wild-type HSCs. CD44 is dispensable for induction of acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia by BCR-ABL, indicating that CD44 is specifically required on leukemic cells that initiate CML. The requirement for donor CD44 is bypassed by direct intrafemoral injection of BCR-ABL1-transduced CD44-deficient stem cells or by coexpression of human CD44. Antibody to CD44 attenuates induction of CML-like leukemia in recipients. These results show that BCR-ABL-expressing leukemic stem cells depend to a greater extent on CD44 for homing and engraftment than do normal HSCs, and argue that CD44 blockade may be beneficial in autologous transplantation in CML.",

Here we report that human neutrophils contain functionally active cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and that structurally diverse CDK inhibitors induce caspase-dependent apoptosis and override powerful anti-apoptosis signals from survival factors such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We show that the CDK inhibitor R-roscovitine (Seliciclib or CYC202) markedly enhances resolution of established neutrophil-dependent inflammation in carrageenan-elicited acute pleurisy, bleomycin-induced lung injury, and passively induced arthritis in mice. In the pleurisy model, the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk prevents R-roscovitine-enhanced resolution of inflammation, indicating that this CDK inhibitor augments inflammatory cell apoptosis. We also provide evidence that R-roscovitine promotes apoptosis by reducing concentrations of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Thus, CDK inhibitors enhance the resolution of established inflammation by promoting apoptosis of inflammatory cells, thereby demonstrating a hitherto unrecognized potential for the treatment of inflammatory disorders.",

Mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6 also known as RALT or Gene 33) is a multiadaptor protein thought to be involved in the regulation of RTK and stress signaling. Here, we show that deletion of the mouse gene encoding Mig6 (designated Errfi1, which stands for ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1) causes hyperactivation of endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and sustained signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, resulting in overproliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Furthermore, Errfi1-/- mice develop spontaneous tumors in various organs and are highly susceptible to chemically induced formation of skin tumors. A tumor-suppressive role for Mig6 is supported by our finding that MIG6 is downregulated in various human cancers. Inhibition of endogenous Egfr signaling with the Egfr inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) or replacement of wild-type Egfr with the kinase-deficient protein encoded by the hypomorphic Egfr(wa2) allele completely rescued skin defects in Erffi1-/- mice. Carcinogen-induced tumors displayed by Errfi1-/- mice were highly sensitive to gefitinib. These results indicate that Mig6 is a specific negative regulator of Egfr signaling in skin morphogenesis and is a novel tumor suppressor of Egfr-dependent carcinogenesis.",

Lipoxins and aspirin-triggered lipoxins are crucial modulators of proinflammatory responses; however, their intracellular mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. We previously showed that lipoxin A4 (LXA4) controls migration of dendritic cells (DCs) and production of interleukin (IL)-12 in vivo. In the absence of LXA4 biosynthetic pathways, the resulting uncontrolled inflammation during infection is lethal, despite pathogen clearance. Here we show that lipoxins activate two receptors in DCs, AhR and LXAR, and that this activation triggers expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-2. SOCS-2-deficient DCs are hyper-responsive to microbial stimuli, as well as refractory to the inhibitory actions of LXA4, but not to IL-10. Upon infection with an intracellular pathogen, SOCS-2-deficient mice had uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines, decreased microbial proliferation, aberrant leukocyte infiltration and elevated mortality. We also show that SOCS-2 is a crucial intracellular mediator of the anti-inflammatory actions of aspirin-induced lipoxins in vivo.",

We found that overexpression of GAB2 (Grb2-associated binding protein 2) increases proliferation of MCF10A mammary cells in three-dimensional culture. Coexpression of GAB2 with antiapoptotic oncogenes causes lumenal filling, whereas coexpression with Neu (also known as ErbB2 and HER2) results in an invasive phenotype. These effects of GAB2 are mediated by hyperactivation of the Shp2-Erk pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of Gab2 potentiates, whereas deficiency of Gab2 ameliorates, Neu-evoked breast carcinogenesis in mice. Finally, GAB2 is amplified in some GAB2-overexpressing human breast tumors. Our data suggest that GAB2 may be a key gene within an 11q13 amplicon in human breast cancer and propose a role for overexpression of GAB2 in mammary carcinogenesis. Agents that target GAB2 or GAB2-dependent pathways may be useful for treating breast tumors that overexpress GAB2 or HER2 or both.",

Growth arrest caused by CCI-779 correlates with a block in translation of mRNA encoding hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1A), and is rescued by expression of a VHL-resistant HIF1A cDNA lacking the 5' untranslated region. VHL-deficient tumors show increased uptake of the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in an mTOR-dependent manner. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for prospective, biomarker-driven clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors in kidney cancer and suggest that FDG-PET scans may have use as a pharmacodynamic marker in this setting.",

Here we show that, in addition, p53 protects the genome from oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), a major cause of DNA damage and genetic instability. In the absence of severe stresses, relatively low levels of p53 are sufficient for upregulation of several genes with antioxidant products, which is associated with a decrease in intracellular ROS. Downregulation of p53 results in excessive oxidation of DNA, increased mutation rate and karyotype instability, which are prevented by incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Dietary supplementation with NAC prevented frequent lymphomas characteristic of Trp53-knockout mice, and slowed the growth of lung cancer xenografts deficient in p53. Our results provide a new paradigm for a nonrestrictive tumor suppressor function of p53 and highlight the potential importance of antioxidants in the prophylaxis and treatment of cancer.",

We investigated whether intramyocardial gene transfer of naked DNA encoding human Shh (phShh) could promote a favorable effect on recovery from acute and chronic myocardial ischemia in adult animals, not only by promoting neovascularization, but by broader effects, consistent with the role of this morphogen in embryogenesis. After Shh gene transfer, the hedgehog pathway was upregulated in mammalian fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. This resulted in preservation of left ventricular function in both acute and chronic myocardial ischemia by enhanced neovascularization, and reduced fibrosis and cardiac apoptosis. Shh gene transfer also enhanced the contribution of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells to myocardial neovascularization. These data suggest that Shh gene therapy may have considerable therapeutic potential in individuals with acute and chronic myocardial ischemia by triggering expression of multiple trophic factors and engendering tissue repair in the adult heart.",

Here we show that such inflammation requires the forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a: Foxo3a-deficient mice are resistant to two models of neutrophilic inflammation, immune complex-mediated inflammatory arthritis and thioglycollate-induced peritonitis. This reflects a need for Foxo3a to maintain neutrophil vitality during inflammation by suppressing Fas ligand; because Foxo3a can bind and suppress the Fasl promoter, Foxo3a-deficient neutrophils upregulate Fas ligand and undergo apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha and IL-1, and Fas ligand blockade renders Foxo3a-deficient mice susceptible to both arthritis and peritonitis. Thus, Foxo3a ensures neutrophil survival during inflammation, identifying Foxo3a as therapeutic target in inflammation.",

Loss of Nbn causes proliferation arrest of granule cell progenitors and apoptosis of postmitotic neurons in the cerebellum. Furthermore, Nbn-deficient neuroprogenitors show proliferation defects (but not increased apoptosis) and contain more chromosomal breaks, which are accompanied by ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM)-mediated p53 activation. Notably, depletion of p53 substantially rescues the neurological defects of Nbn mutant mice. This study gives insight into the physiological function of NBS1 (the Nbn gene product) and the function of the DNA damage response in the neurological anomalies of NBS, ataxia telangiectasia and ATLD.",

We show that this effect is the result of an increase in TGF-beta1 and enhanced dermal fibroblast infiltration into wounds of beta(3)-null mice. Specifically, beta(3)-integrin deficiency is associated with elevated TGF-beta receptor I and receptor II expression, reduced Smad3 levels, sustained Smad2 and Smad4 nuclear localization and enhanced TGF-beta1-mediated dermal fibroblast migration. These data indicate that alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin can suppress TGF-beta1-mediated signaling, thereby controlling the rate of wound healing, and highlight a new mechanism for TGF-beta1 regulation by beta(3)-integrins.",

However, an alternative pathway may involve members of the CalDAG-GEF/RasGRP protein family, which have structural features (calcium-binding EF hands and DAG-binding C1 domains) that suggest they can function in calcium and DAG signal integration. To gain insight into the signaling systems that may be regulated by CalDAG-GEF/RasGRP family members, we have focused on CalDAG-GEFI, which is expressed preferentially in the brain and blood. Through genetic ablation in the mouse, we have found that CalDAG-GEFI is crucial for signal integration in platelets. Mouse platelets that lack CalDAG-GEFI are severely compromised in integrin-dependent aggregation as a consequence of their inability to signal through CalDAG-GEFI to its target, the small GTPase Rap1. These results suggest that analogous signaling defects are likely to occur in the central nervous system when CalDAG-GEFI is absent or compromised in function.",

In mice overexpressing human UCP-2, brain damage was diminished after experimental stroke and traumatic brain injury, and neurological recovery was enhanced. In cultured cortical neurons, UCP-2 reduced cell death and inhibited caspase-3 activation induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation. Mild mitochondrial uncoupling by 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) reduced neuronal death, and UCP-2 activity was enhanced by palmitic acid in isolated mitochondria. Also in isolated mitochondria, UCP-2 shifted the release of reactive oxygen species from the mitochondrial matrix to the extramitochondrial space.

Thus, transplantation of genetically modified bone marrow progenitors may represent a vehicle for the transport of gene therapy to tumors. We transduced bone marrow progenitors with lentiviral vectors expressing genes from transcription-regulatory elements of Tie2/Tek gene. When tumors were grown in the transplanted mice, the new vector marked a distinct hematopoietic population that 'homed' to the tumor and closely interacted with vascular ECs at the tumor periphery. These Tie2-expressing mononuclear (TEM) cells had a distinguishable phenotype and were present selectively at angiogenic sites. Unexpectedly, we did not find bone marrow-derived ECs in tumor vessels when we transplanted bone marrow progenitors constitutively expressing a marker gene from the Tie2 or ubiquitously active promoters. By delivering a 'suicide' gene, we selectively eliminated the TEM cells and achieved substantial inhibition of angiogenesis and slower tumor growth without systemic toxicity. Thus, TEM cells may account for the proangiogenic activity of bone marrow-derived cells in tumors, may represent a new target for drug development and may provide the means for selective gene delivery and targeted inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.",

In PEDF-deficient mice, stromal vessels were increased and associated with epithelial cell hyperplasia. Androgens inhibited prostatic PEDF expression in cultured cells.

        "TEXT": "Mechanisms linking mitogenic and growth inhibitory cytokine signaling and the cell cycle have not been fully elucidated in either cancer or in normal cells. Here we show that activation of protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt, contributes to resistance to antiproliferative signals and breast cancer progression in part by impairing the nuclear import and action of p27. Akt transfection caused cytoplasmic p27 accumulation and resistance to cytokine-mediated G1 arrest. The nuclear localization signal of p27 contains an Akt consensus site at threonine 157, and p27 phosphorylation by Akt impaired its nuclear import in vitro. Akt phosphorylated wild-type p27 but not p27T157A. In cells transfected with constitutively active Akt(T308DS473D)(PKB(DD)), p27WT mislocalized to the cytoplasm, but p27T157A was nuclear. In cells with activated Akt, p27WT failed to cause G1 arrest, while the antiproliferative effect of p27T157A was not impaired. Cytoplasmic p27 was seen in 41% (52 of 128) of primary human breast cancers in conjunction with Akt activation and was correlated with a poor patient prognosis. Thus, we show a novel mechanism whereby Akt impairs p27 function that is associated with an aggressive phenotype in human breast cancer.",

Glioblastoma cells exhibit highly migratory and invasive behavior, which makes surgical intervention unsuccessful. Here, we showed that glioblastoma cells express Ca(2+)-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors assembled from the GluR1 and/or GluR4 subunits, and that their conversion to Ca(2+)-impermeable receptors by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the GluR2 cDNA inhibited cell locomotion and induced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors facilitated migration and proliferation of the tumor cells. These findings indicate that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors have crucial roles in growth of glioblastoma. Blockage of these Ca(2+)-permeable receptors may be a useful therapeutic strategy for the prevention of glioblastoma invasion.",

In contrast, B7-H1 is abundant in human carcinomas of lung, ovary and colon and in melanomas. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma upregulates B7-H1 on the surface of tumor cell lines. Cancer cell-associated B7-H1 increases apoptosis of antigen-specific human T-cell clones in vitro, and the apoptotic effect of B7-H1 is mediated largely by one or more receptors other than PD-1. In addition, expression of B7-H1 on mouse P815 tumor increases apoptosis of activated tumor-reactive T cells and promotes the growth of highly immunogenic B7-1(+) tumors in vivo.

So far, immunological mechanisms responsible for demyelination have been the focus of interest. However, mechanisms regulating axon maintenance as well as glial precursor-cell proliferation and oligodendrocyte survival might also influence disease outcome. The cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which was originally identified as a survival factor for isolated neurons, promotes differentiation, maturation and survival of oligodendrocytes. To investigate the role of endogenous CNTF in inflammatory demyelinating disease, we studied myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in CNTF-deficient and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Disease was more severe in CNTF-deficient mice and recovery was poor, with a 60% decrease in the number of proliferating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and a more than 50% increase in the rate of oligodendrocyte apoptosis. In addition, vacuolar dystrophy of myelin and axonal damage were more severe in CNTF-deficient mice. These specific pathological features could be prevented by treatment with an antiserum against tumor necrosis factor-alpha, suggesting that endogenous CNTF may counterbalance this effect of TNF-alpha (ref. 7). Here we identify a factor that modulates, in an inflammatory environment, glial cell survival and is an outcome determinant of EAE.",

They are also implicated in the growth of colonic polyps and cancers. However, the precise mechanisms of these trophic actions of PGs remain unclear. As activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) triggers mitogenic signaling in gastrointestinal mucosa, and its expression is also upregulated in colonic cancers and most neoplasms, we investigated whether PGs transactivate EGFR. Here we provide evidence that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) rapidly phosphorylates EGFR and triggers the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)--mitogenic signaling pathway in normal gastric epithelial (RGM1) and colon cancer (Caco-2, LoVo and HT-29) cell lines. Inactivation of EGFR kinase with selective inhibitors significantly reduces PGE2-induced ERK2 activation, c-fos mRNA expression and cell proliferation. Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) or c-Src blocked PGE2-mediated EGFR transactivation and downstream signaling indicating that PGE2-induced EGFR transactivation involves signaling transduced via TGF-alpha, an EGFR ligand, likely released by c-Src-activated MMP(s). Our findings that PGE2 transactivates EGFR reveal a previously unknown mechanism by which PGE2 mediates trophic actions resulting in gastric and intestinal hypertrophy as well as growth of colonic polyps and cancers.",

We also observed that angiogenic responses to hypoxia and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are augmented significantly in the absence of beta3 integrins. We found no evidence that the expression or functions of other integrins were altered as a consequence of the beta3 deficiency, but we did observe elevated levels of VEGF receptor-2 (also called Flk-1) in beta3-null endothelial cells.

These include its absence from some animal (particularly swine) influenza virus isolates, variable expression in individual infected cells, rapid proteasome-dependent degradation and mitochondrial localization. Exposure of cells to a synthetic version of PB1-F2 induces apoptosis, and influenza viruses with targeted mutations that interfere with PB1-F2 expression induce less extensive apoptosis in human monocytic cells than those with intact PB1-F2.

Although much attention has focused on pro-inflammatory pathways that initiate inflammation, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that switch off inflammation and resolve the inflammatory response. The transcription factor NF-kappaB is thought to have a central role in the induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression and has attracted interest as a new target for the treatment of inflammatory disease. We show here that NF-kappaB activation in leukocytes recruited during the onset of inflammation is associated with pro-inflammatory gene expression, whereas such activation during the resolution of inflammation is associated with the expression of anti-inflammatory genes and the induction of apoptosis. Inhibition of NF-kappaB during the resolution of inflammation protracts the inflammatory response and prevents apoptosis. This suggests that NF-kappaB has an anti-inflammatory role in vivo involving the regulation of inflammatory resolution.",

        "TEXT": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism, is overexpressed in many cancers. Inhibition of COX-2 by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduces the risk of cancer development in humans and suppresses tumor growth in animal models. The anti-cancer effect of NSAIDs seems to involve suppression of tumor angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. Integrin alpha V beta 3 is an adhesion receptor critically involved in mediating tumor angiogenesis. Here we show that inhibition of endothelial-cell COX-2 by NSAIDs suppresses alpha V beta 3-dependent activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac, resulting in inhibition of endothelial-cell spreading and migration in vitro and suppression of fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis in vivo. These results establish a novel functional link between COX-2, integrin alpha V beta 3 and Cdc42-/Rac-dependent endothelial-cell migration. Moreover, they provide a rationale to the understanding of the anti-angiogenic activity of NSAIDs.",

Here we demonstrate that aP2 is also expressed in macrophages, has a significant role in their biological responses and contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice also deficient for aP2 showed protection from atherosclerosis in the absence of significant differences in serum lipids or insulin sensitivity. aP2-deficient macrophages showed alterations in inflammatory cytokine production and a reduced ability to accumulate cholesterol esters when exposed to modified lipoproteins. Apoe-/- mice with Ap2+/+ adipocytes and Ap2-/- macrophages generated by bone-marrow transplantation showed a comparable reduction in atherosclerotic lesions to those with total aP2 deficiency, indicating an independent role for macrophage aP2 in atherogenesis. Through its distinct actions in adipocytes and macrophages, aP2 provides a link between features of the metabolic syndrome and could be a new therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerosis.",

Whereas the significance of angiogenesis for tumor progression has been well documented, the ability of tumor cells to induce the growth of lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) and the presence of intratumoral lymphatic vessels have been controversial. Using a novel marker for lymphatic endothelium, LYVE-1, we demonstrate here the occurrence of intratumoral lymphangiogenesis within human breast cancers after orthotopic transplantation onto nude mice. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C overexpression in breast cancer cells potently increased intratumoral lymphangiogenesis, resulting in significantly enhanced metastasis to regional lymph nodes and to lungs. The degree of tumor lymphangiogenesis was highly correlated with the extent of lymph node and lung metastases. These results establish the occurrence and biological significance of intratumoral lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer and identify VEGF-C as a molecular link between tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis.",

        "TEXT": "Maspin, a unique member of the serpin family, is a secreted protein encoded by a class II tumor suppressor gene whose downregulation is associated with the development of breast and prostate cancers. Overexpression of maspin in breast tumor cells limits their growth and metastases in vivo. In this report we demonstrate that maspin is an effective inhibitor of angiogenesis. In vitro, it acted directly on cultured endothelial cells to stop their migration towards basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor and to limit mitogenesis and tube formation. In vivo, it blocked neovascularization in the rat cornea pocket model. Maspin derivatives mutated in the serpin reactive site lost their ability to inhibit the migration of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and breast cancer cells but were still able to block angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. When maspin was delivered locally to human prostate tumor cells in a xenograft mouse model, it blocked tumor growth and dramatically reduced the density of tumor-associated microvessels. These data suggest that the tumor suppressor activity of maspin may depend in large part on its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and raise the possibility that maspin and similar serpins may be excellent leads for the development of drugs that modulate angiogenesis.",

In most human somatic cells, telomerase expression is repressed, and telomeres shorten progressively with each cell division. In contrast, most human tumors express telomerase, resulting in stabilized telomere length. These observations indicate that telomere maintenance is essential to the proliferation of tumor cells. We show here that expression of a mutant catalytic subunit of human telomerase results in complete inhibition of telomerase activity, reduction in telomere length and death of tumor cells. Moreover, expression of this mutant telomerase eliminated tumorigenicity in vivo. These observations demonstrate that disruption of telomere maintenance limits cellular lifespan in human cancer cells, thus validating human telomerase reverse transcriptase as an important target for the development of anti-neoplastic therapies.",

            "TEXT": "USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN/parkin and antagonizes its role in mitophagy.\n\nPRKN/parkin activation through phosphorylation of its ubiquitin and \nubiquitin-like domain by PINK1 is critical in mitophagy induction for \neliminating the damaged mitochondria. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) \nfunctionally reversing PRKN ubiquitination are critical in controlling the \nmagnitude of PRKN-mediated mitophagy process. However, potential DUBs that \ndirectly target PRKN and antagonize its pro-mitophagy effect remains to be \nidentified and characterized. Here, we demonstrated that USP33/VDU1 is localized \nat the outer membrane of mitochondria and serves as a PRKN DUB through their \ninteraction. Cellular and in vitro assays illustrated that USP33 deubiquitinates \nPRKN in a DUB activity-dependent manner. USP33 prefers to remove K6, K11, K48 \nand K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates from PRKN, and deubiquitinates PRKN mainly \nat Lys435. Mutation of this site leads to a significantly decreased level of \nK63-, but not K48-linked PRKN ubiquitination. USP33 deficiency enhanced both \nK48- and K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination, but only K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination \nwas significantly increased under mitochondrial depolarization. Further, USP33 \nknockdown increased both PRKN protein stabilization and its translocation to \ndepolarized mitochondria leading to the enhancement of mitophagy. Moreover, \nUSP33 silencing protects SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells from the neurotoxin \nMPTP-induced apoptotic cell death. Our findings convincingly demonstrate that \nUSP33 is a novel PRKN deubiquitinase antagonizing its regulatory roles in \nmitophagy and SH-SY5Y neuron-like cell survival. Thus, USP33 inhibition may \nrepresents an attractive new therapeutic strategy for PD patients.",

Histone \nmethyltransferase KMT2D (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also called MLL4) is among the \nmost highly inactivated epigenetic modifiers in lung cancer. Here, we show that \nlung-specific loss of Kmt2d promotes lung tumorigenesis in mice and upregulates \npro-tumorigenic programs, including glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of \nglycolysis preferentially impedes tumorigenicity of human lung cancer cells \nbearing KMT2D-inactivating mutations. Mechanistically, Kmt2d loss widely impairs \nepigenomic signals for super-enhancers/enhancers, including the super-enhancer \nfor the circadian rhythm repressor Per2. Loss of Kmt2d decreases expression of \nPER2, which regulates multiple glycolytic genes. These findings indicate that \nKMT2D is a lung tumor suppressor and that KMT2D deficiency confers a therapeutic \nvulnerability to glycolytic inhibitors.",

            "TEXT": "The AMPK-MFN2 axis regulates MAM dynamics and autophagy induced by energy \nstresses.\n\nEnergy deprivation activates the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein \nkinase (AMPK), which in turn induces macroautophagy/autophagy. The \nmitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM) plays a key role in mitochondrial \ndivision and autophagy, and the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 (mitofusin 2) \ntethers the MAM, but the mechanism by which AMPK and MFN2 regulate autophagy in \nresponse to energy stress remains unclear. Here, we found that energy stress not \nonly triggers mitochondrial fission and autophagy, but more importantly \nincreases the number of MAMs, a process that requires AMPK. Interestingly, under \nenergy stress, considerable amounts of AMPK translocate from cytosol to the MAM \nand the mitochondrion as mitochondrial fission occurs. Unexpectedly, AMPK \ninteracts directly with MFN2. The autophagic ability of mouse embryonic \nfibroblasts (MEFs) lacking MFN2 (mfn2-/-) is significantly attenuated in \nresponse to energy stress as compared to wild-type MEFs (WT MEFs), while \nre-expression of MFN2 in mfn2-/- cells rescues the autophagy defects of these \ncells. The abundance of MAMs is also greatly reduced in MFN2-deficient cells. \nFunctional experiments show that the oxygen consumption rate and the glycolytic \nfunction of cells lacking MFN2 but not MFN1 are obviously attenuated, and MFN2 \nis important for cell survival under energy stress. In conclusion, our study \nestablishes the molecular link between the energy sensor AMPK and the MAM tether \nMFN2, and reveals the important role of AMPK and MFN2 in energy stress-induced \nautophagy and MAM dynamics.",

CDK4/6 inhibitors, however, are not \nexpected to cooperate with DNA-damaging or antimitotic chemotherapies as the \nformer prevent cell-cycle entry, thus interfering with S-phase- or \nmitosis-targeting agents. Here, we report that sequential administration of \nCDK4/6 inhibitors after taxanes cooperates to prevent cellular proliferation in \npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, patient-derived xenografts, and \ngenetically engineered mice with Kras G12V and Cdkn2a-null mutations frequently \nobserved in PDAC. This effect correlates with the repressive activity of CDK4/6 \ninhibitors on homologous recombination proteins required for the recovery from \nchromosomal damage. CDK4/6 inhibitors also prevent recovery from multiple \nDNA-damaging agents, suggesting broad applicability for their sequential \nadministration after available chemotherapeutic agents.",

            "TEXT": "RAD51AP1 Deficiency Reduces Tumor Growth by Targeting Stem Cell Self-Renewal.\n\nRAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) plays an integral role in homologous \nrecombination by activating RAD51 recombinase. Homologous recombination is \nessential for preserving genome integrity and RAD51AP1 is critical for D-loop \nformation, a key step in homologous recombination. Although RAD51AP1 is involved \nin maintaining genomic stability, recent studies have shown that RAD51AP1 \nexpression is significantly upregulated in human cancers. However, the \nfunctional role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and the underlying molecular \nmechanism(s) by which RAD51AP1 regulates tumorigenesis have not been fully \nunderstood. Here, we use Rad51ap1-knockout mice in genetically engineered mouse \nmodels of breast cancer to unravel the role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and \nmetastasis. RAD51AP1 gene transcript was increased in both luminal estrogen \nreceptor-positive breast cancer and basal triple-negative breast cancer, which \nis associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, knockdown of RAD51AP1 (RADP51AP1 \nKD) in breast cancer cell lines reduced tumor growth. Rad51ap1-deficient mice \nwere protected from oncogene-driven spontaneous mouse mammary tumor growth and \nassociated lung metastasis. In vivo, limiting dilution studies provided evidence \nthat Rad51ap1 plays a critical role in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) \nself-renewal. RAD51AP1 KD improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy response by \ninhibiting BCSC self-renewal and associated pluripotency. Overall, our study \nprovides genetic and biochemical evidences that RAD51AP1 is critical for tumor \ngrowth and metastasis by increasing BCSC self-renewal and may serve as a novel \ntarget for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-resistant breast cancer.",

            "TEXT": "Impaired RIPK1 ubiquitination sensitizes mice to TNF toxicity and inflammatory \ncell death.\n\nReceptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1; RIPK1) is a key regulator of multiple \nsignaling pathways that mediate inflammatory responses and cell death. TNF-TNFR1 \ntriggered signaling complex formation, subsequent NF-κB and MAPK activation and \ninduction of cell death involve RIPK1 ubiquitination at several lysine residues \nincluding Lys376 and Lys115. Here we show that mutating the ubiquitination site \nK376 of RIPK1 (K376R) in mice activates cell death resulting in embryonic \nlethality. In contrast to Ripk1K376R/K376R mice, Ripk1K115R/K115R mice reached \nadulthood and showed slightly higher responsiveness to TNF-induced death. Cell \ndeath observed in Ripk1K376R/K376R embryos relied on RIPK1 kinase activity as \nadministration of RIPK1 inhibitor GNE684 to pregnant heterozygous mice \neffectively blocked cell death and prolonged survival. Embryonic lethality of \nRipk1K376R/K376R mice was prevented by the loss of TNFR1, or by simultaneous \ndeletion of caspase-8 and RIPK3. Interestingly, elimination of the wild-type \nallele from adult Ripk1K376R/cko mice was tolerated. However, adult \nRipk1K376R/cko mice were exquisitely sensitive to TNF-induced hypothermia and \nassociated lethality. Absence of the K376 ubiquitination site diminished \nK11-linked, K63-linked, and linear ubiquitination of RIPK1, and promoted the \nassembly of death-inducing cellular complexes, suggesting that multiple \nubiquitin linkages contribute to the stability of the RIPK1 signaling complex \nthat stimulates NF-κB and MAPK activation. In contrast, mutating K115 did not \naffect RIPK1 ubiquitination or TNF stimulated NF-κB and MAPK signaling. Overall, \nour data indicate that selective impairment of RIPK1 ubiquitination can lower \nthe threshold for RIPK1 activation by TNF resulting in cell death and embryonic \nlethality.",

RNA-sequencing was then performed to explore the \npotential mechanisms and transcriptional changes in the process.

The induction of ferroptosis in the DOX-treated heart was \nconfirmed by transmission electron microscopy, and the inhibition of ferroptosis \nusing Fer-1 effectively prevented the cardiac injury as well as the \nultrastructure changes of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial. Both in vitro and in vivo \nexperiments proved the downregulation of Acot1 in DIC, which can be partially \nprevented with Fer-1 treatment. Overexpression of Acot1 in cell lines showed \nnoteworthy protection to ferroptosis, while the knock-down of Acot1 sensitized \ncardiomyocytes to ferroptosis by DIC. Finally, the heart tissue of αMHC-Acot1 \ntransgenic mice presented altered free fatty acid composition, indicating that \nthe benefit of Acot1 in the inhibition of ferroptosis lies biochemically and \nrelates to its enzymatic function in lipid metabolism in DIC. The current study \nhighlights the importance of ferroptosis in DIC and points out the potential \nprotective role of Acot1 in the process. The beneficial role of Acot1 may be \nrelated to its biochemical function by shaping the lipid composition. In all, \nAcot1 may become a potential treating target in preventing DIC by \nanti-ferroptosis.",

            "TEXT": "Metformin alleviates hyperglycemia-induced endothelial impairment by \ndownregulating autophagy via the Hedgehog pathway.\n\nStudies regarding macroautophagic/autophagic regulation in endothelial cells \n(ECs) under diabetic conditions are very limited. Clinical evidence establishes \nan endothelial protective effect of metformin, but the underlying mechanisms \nremain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether metformin exerts its protective \nrole against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial impairment through the autophagy \nmachinery. db/db mice were treated with intravitreal metformin injections. Human \numbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured either in normal glucose \n(NG, 5.5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 33 mM) medium in the presence or absence of \nmetformin for 72 h. We observed an obvious inhibition of hyperglycemia-triggered \nautophagosome synthesis in both the diabetic retinal vasculature and cultured \nHUVECs by metformin, along with restoration of hyperglycemia-impaired Hedgehog \n(Hh) pathway activity. Specifically, deletion of ATG7 in retinal vascular ECs of \ndb/db mice and cultured HUVECs indicated a detrimental role of autophagy in \nhyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. Pretreatment with GANT61, a Hh \npathway inhibitor, abolished the metformin-mediated downregulation of autophagy \nand endothelial protective action. Furthermore, GLI-family (transcription \nfactors of the Hh pathway) knockdown in HUVECs and retinal vasculature revealed \nthat downregulation of hyperglycemia-activated autophagy by the \nmetformin-mediated Hh pathway activation was GLI1 dependent. Mechanistically, \nGLI1 knockdown-triggered autophagy was related to upregulation of BNIP3, which \nsubsequently disrupted the association of BECN1/Beclin 1 and BCL2. The role of \nBNIP3 in BECN1 dissociation from BCL2 was further confirmed by BNIP3 \noverexpression or BNIP3 RNAi. Taken together, the endothelial protective effect \nof metformin under hyperglycemia conditions could be partly attributed to its \nrole in downregulating autophagy via Hh pathway activation.",

            "TEXT": "MAPT/Tau accumulation represses autophagy flux by disrupting IST1-regulated \nESCRT-III complex formation: a vicious cycle in Alzheimer neurodegeneration.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy deficit induces intracellular MAPT/tau accumulation, \nthe hallmark pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies; however, \nthe reverse role of MAPT accumulation in autophagy and neurodegeneration is not \nclear. Here, we found that overexpression of human wild-type full-length MAPT, \nwhich models MAPT pathologies as seen in sporadic AD patients, induced autophagy \ndeficits via repression of autophagosome-lysosome fusion leading to \nsignificantly increased LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)-II \nand SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) protein levels with autophagosome accumulation. \nAt the molecular level, intracellular MAPT aggregation inhibited expression of \nIST1 (IST1 factor associated with ESCRT-III), a positive modulator for the \nformation of ESCRT (the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) \ncomplex that is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Upregulating IST1 in \nhuman MAPT transgenic mice attenuated autophagy deficit with reduced MAPT \naggregation and ameliorated synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, while \ndownregulating IST1 per se induced autophagy deficit with impaired synapse and \ncognitive function in naïve mice. IST1 can facilitate association of CHMP2B \n(charged multivesicular body protein 2B) and CHMP4B/SNF7-2 to form ESCRT-III \ncomplex, while lack of IST1 impeded the complex formation. Finally, we \ndemonstrate that MAPT accumulation suppresses IST1 transcription with the \nmechanisms involving the ANP32A-regulated mask of histone acetylation. Our \nfindings suggest that the AD-like MAPT accumulation can repress \nautophagosome-lysosome fusion by deregulating ANP32A-INHAT-IST1-ESCRT-III \npathway, which also reveals a vicious cycle of MAPT accumulation and autophagy \ndeficit in the chronic course of AD neurodegeneration.",

Locally \nadvanced colon cancers often invade into surrounding adipose tissue with a \ndirect contact with adipocytes. We have previously shown that adipocytes promote \ntumor growth by modulating cellular metabolism. Here we demonstrate that \ncarnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1A), a key enzyme controlling fatty acid \noxidation (FAO), was upregulated in colon cancer cells upon exposure to \nadipocytes or fatty acids. In addition, CPT1A expression was increased in \ninvasive tumor cells within the adipose tissue compared to tumors without direct \ncontact with adipocytes. Silencing CPT1A abolished the protective effect \nprovided by fatty acids against nutrient deprivation and reduced tumor organoid \nformation in 3D culture and the expression of genes associated with cancer stem \ncells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin. Mechanistically, CPT1A-dependent FAO promoted \nthe acetylation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Furthermore, knockdown \nof CPT1A blocked the tumor-promoting effect of adipocytes in vivo and inhibited \nxenograft tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings identify CPT1A-depedent \nFAO as an essential metabolic pathway that enables the interaction between \nadipocytes and colon cancer cells.",

            "TEXT": "FNDC5 alleviates oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in \ndoxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via activating AKT.\n\nOxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis play critical roles in doxorubicin \n(DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. Previous studies indicated that fibronectin type \nIII domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) and its cleaved form, irisin, could preserve \nmitochondrial function and attenuate oxidative damage as well as cell apoptosis, \nhowever, its role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains unknown. Our present \nstudy aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of FNDC5 on \noxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. \nCardiomyocyte-specific FNDC5 overexpression was achieved using an \nadeno-associated virus system, and then the mice were exposed to a single \nintraperitoneal injection of DOX (15 mg/kg) to generate DOX-induced \ncardiotoxicity. Herein, we found that FNDC5 expression was downregulated in \nDOX-treated murine hearts and cardiomyocytes. Fndc5 deficiency resulted in \nincreased oxidative damage and apoptosis in H9C2 cells under basal conditions, \nimitating the phenotype of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in vitro, conversely, \nFNDC5 overexpression or irisin treatment alleviated DOX-induced oxidative stress \nand cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified \nthat FNDC5/Irisin activated AKT/mTOR signaling and decreased DOX-induced \ncardiomyocyte apoptosis, and moreover, we provided direct evidence that the \nanti-oxidant effect of FNDC5/Irisin was mediated by the AKT/GSK3β/FYN/Nrf2 axis \nin an mTOR-independent manner. And we also demonstrated that heat shock protein \n20 was responsible for the activation of AKT caused by FNDC5/Irisin. In line \nwith the data in acute model, we also found that FNDC5/Irisin exerted beneficial \neffects in chronic model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (5 mg/kg, i.p., once a \nweek for three times, the total cumulative dose is 15 mg/kg) in mice. Based on \nthese findings, we supposed that FNDC5/Irisin was a potential therapeutic agent \nagainst DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",

The aim of this study \nwas to investigate roles of SKIL in tumorigenesis and immune escape of \nnon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SKIL expression levels in NSCLC cell line, \nclinical sample, and adjacent normal tissue were measured by quantitative PCR, \nwestern blot, or immunohistochemistry. Lentivirus was used to \noverexpress/silence SKIL or TAZ expression. Malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells \nwere evaluated by colony formation, transwell, and MTT assays, and in xenograft \nmice model. Syngeneic mice model and flow cytometry were used to evaluate T cell \ninfiltration. Quantitative PCR and western blot were applied to evaluate \nrelevant mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation was \napplied to unveil the interaction between SKIL and TAZ. SKIL expression was \nhigher in NSCLC tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Silencing of SKIL \ninhibited malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells and promoted T cell infiltration. \nSKIL-knockdown inhibited autophagy and activated the STING pathway in NSCLC \ncells through down-regulation of TAZ. Silencing of TAZ cancelled the effects of \nSKIL overexpression on malignant phenotypes and autophagy of NSCLC cells. \nInhibition of autophagy reversed the effects of SKIL/TAZ overexpression on the \nSTING pathway. In conclusion, SKIL promoted tumorigenesis and immune escape of \nNSCLC cells through upregulation of TAZ/autophagy axis and inhibition on \ndownstream STING pathway.",

            "TEXT": "AFP promotes HCC progression by suppressing the HuR-mediated Fas/FADD apoptotic \npathway.\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major leading cause of cancer-related death \nworldwide. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is reactivated in a majority of \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with poor patient outcomes. \nAlthough increasing evidence has shown that AFP can regulate HCC cell growth, \nthe precise functions of AFP in hepatocarcinogenesis and the associated \nunderlying mechanism remain incompletely understood. In this study, we \ndemostrated that depleting AFP significantly suppressed diethylnitrosamine \n(DEN)-induced liver tumor progression in an AFP gene-deficient mouse model. \nSimilarly, knocking down AFP expression inhibited human HCC cell proliferation \nand tumor growth by inducing apoptosis. AFP expression level was inversely \nassociated with the apoptotic rate in mouse and human HCC specimens. \nInvestigation of potential cross-talk between AFP and apoptotic signaling \nrevealed that AFP exerted its growth-promoting effect by suppressing the \nFas/FADD-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Mechanistically, AFP bound to the \nRNA-binding protein HuR, increasing the accumulation of HuR in the cytoplasm and \nsubsequent inhibition of Fas mRNA translation. In addition, we found that \ninhibiting AFP enhanced the cytotoxicity of therapeutics to AFP-positive HCC \ncells by activating HuR-mediated Fas/FADD apoptotic signaling. Conclusion: Our \nstudy defined the pro-oncogenic role of AFP in HCC progression and uncovered a \nnovel antiapoptotic mechanism connecting AFP to HuR-mediated Fas translation. \nOur findings suggest that AFP is involved in the pathogenesis and \nchemosensitivity of HCC and that blockade of AFP may be a promising strategy to \ntreat advanced HCC.",

However, \nresistance to enzalutamide inevitably develops in these patients, and the \nunderlying mechanisms of this resistance are not fully defined. Here we \ndemonstrate that the kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) contributes to \nenzalutamide resistance by enhancing the AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. \nKIF15 directly bound the N-terminus of AR/AR-V7 and prevented AR/AR-V7 proteins \nfrom degradation by increasing the protein association of ubiquitin-specific \nprotease 14 (USP14) with AR/AR-V7. In turn, the transcriptionally active AR \nstimulated KIF15 expression. KIF15 inhibitors alone or in combination with \nenzalutamide significantly suppressed enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer \ncell growth and xenograft progression. These findings highlight a key role of \nKIF15 in enabling prostate cancer cells to develop therapy resistance to \nenzalutamide and rationalize KIF15 as a potential therapeutic target. \nSIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate how reciprocal activation between KIF15 \nand AR contributes to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer and highlights \ncotargeting KIF15 and AR as a therapeutic strategy for these tumors.",

Since MTOR is known to \ngenerally suppress autophagy, the apparently independent regulation of these two \nkey pathways of glomerular maintenance remained puzzling. We now report that \nlong-term genetic manipulation of MTOR activity does in fact not influence high \nbasal levels of autophagy in podocytes either in vitro or in vivo. Instead we \npresent data showing that autophagy in podocytes is mainly controlled by \nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1 (unc-51 like kinase 1). \nPharmacological inhibition of MTOR further shows that the uncoupling of MTOR \nactivity and autophagy is time dependent. Together, our data reveal a novel and \nunexpected cell-specific mechanism, which permits concurrent MTOR activity as \nwell as high basal autophagy rates in podocytes. Thus, these data indicate \nmanipulation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis rather than inhibition of MTOR as a promising \ntherapeutic intervention to enhance autophagy and preserve podocyte homeostasis \nin glomerular diseases.",

Functional \ncharacterization indicated that CPAP overexpression increases tumor growth, \nangiogenesis, and metastasis ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, overexpressed \nCPAP contributes to sorafenib resistance. Mechanical investigation showed that \nthe expression level of CPAP is positively correlated with activated STAT3 in \nHCC. CPAP acts as a transcriptional coactivator of STAT3 by directly binding \nwith STAT3. Interrupting the interaction between CPAP and STAT3 attenuates \nSTAT3-mediated tumor growth and angiogenesis. Overexpression of CPAP upregulates \nseveral STAT3 target genes such as IL-8 and CD44 that are involved in \nangiogenesis, and CPAP mRNA expression is positively correlated with the levels \nof both mRNAs in HCC. Knocked-down expression of CPAP impairs IL-6-mediated \nSTAT3 activation, target gene expression, cell migration, and invasion \nabilities. IL-6/STAT3-mediated angiogenesis is significantly increased by CPAP \noverexpression and can be blocked by decreased expression of IL-8. Our findings \nnot only shed light on the importance of CPAP in HCC malignancies, but also \nprovide potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the angiogenesis pathway \nand treating metastatic HCC.",

            "TEXT": "PHB2 (prohibitin 2) promotes PINK1-PRKN/Parkin-dependent mitophagy by the \nPARL-PGAM5-PINK1 axis.\n\nMitophagy, which is a conserved cellular process for selectively removing \ndamaged or unwanted mitochondria, is critical for mitochondrial quality control \nand the maintenance of normal cellular physiology. However, the precise \nmechanisms underlying mitophagy remain largely unknown. Prior studies on \nmitophagy focused on the events in the mitochondrial outer membrane. PHB2 \n(prohibitin 2), which is a highly conserved membrane scaffold protein, was \nrecently identified as a novel inner membrane mitophagy receptor that mediates \nmitophagy. Here, we report a new signaling pathway for PHB2-mediated mitophagy. \nUpon mitochondrial membrane depolarization or misfolded protein aggregation, \nPHB2 depletion destabilizes PINK1 in the mitochondria, which blocks the \nmitochondrial recruitment of PRKN/Parkin, ubiquitin and OPTN (optineurin), \nleading to an inhibition of mitophagy. In addition, PHB2 overexpression directly \ninduces PRKN recruitment to the mitochondria. Moreover, PHB2-mediated mitophagy \nis dependent on the mitochondrial inner membrane protease PARL, which interacts \nwith PHB2 and is activated upon PHB2 depletion. Furthermore, PGAM5, which is \nprocessed by PARL, participates in PHB2-mediated PINK1 stabilization. Finally, a \nligand of PHB proteins that we synthesized, called FL3, was found to strongly \ninhibit PHB2-mediated mitophagy and to effectively block cancer cell growth and \nenergy production at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, our findings reveal that \nthe PHB2-PARL-PGAM5-PINK1 axis is a novel pathway of PHB2-mediated mitophagy and \nthat targeting PHB2 with the chemical compound FL3 is a promising strategy for \ncancer therapy.",

We have previously demonstrated \nthat certain miRNAs play a crucial role in the innate immune responses of human \noral epithelial cells to Porphyromonas gingivalis. While addressing the \nmechanisms of P. gingivalis induced apoptosis in these cells, we discovered that \ncertain miRNAs are upregulated upon stimulation with live bacteria. These \nupregulated miRNAs include hsa-miR-584, hsa-miR-572, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-492, \nhsa-miR-623 and hsa-miR-663. Further analysis revealed an unexpected role for \nhsa-miR-663 (miR-663). To further evaluate miR-663 function, we overexpressed \nmiR-663 in epithelial cells which resulted in cellular apoptosis. The \nbioinformatics analysis of the miR-663 target prediction, revealed a strong \nbinding affinity to a 3' UTR region of Apoptosis Antagonizing Transcription \nFactor (AATF) mRNA. To demonstrate the binding of miR-663 to AATF mRNA, the \nputative miR-663 target site within the 3'-UTR region of AATF was cloned in \nluciferase vector and transfected to HEK293T cells. Luminescence data showed the \ndownregulation of luciferase activity in cells that had the full length target \nregion of the putative binding site, confirming that AATF is one of the targets \nfor miR-663. This prompted us to further evaluate its role in a cancer cell line \n(MCF-7) to determine miR-663s' apoptotic function. The overexpression of miR-663 \nled to a significant increase in apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, \nmiR-663 may function as an 'apoptomiR' by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic gene \nAATF to induce apoptosis.

            "TEXT": "Activating transcription factor-4 promotes neuronal death induced by Parkinson's \ndisease neurotoxins and α-synuclein aggregates.\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the \nloss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra resulting in severe and \nprogressive motor impairments. However, the mechanisms underlying this neuronal \nloss remain largely unknown. Oxidative stress and ER stress have been implicated \nin PD and these factors are known to activate the integrated stress response \n(ISR). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key mediator of the ISR, and \nhas been reported to induce the expression of genes involved in cellular \nhomeostasis. However, during prolonged activation ATF4 can also induce the \nexpression of pro-death target genes. Therefore, in the present study, we \ninvestigated the role of ATF4 in neuronal cell death in models of PD. We \ndemonstrate that PD neurotoxins (MPP+ and 6-OHDA) and α-synuclein aggregation \ninduced by pre-formed human alpha-synuclein fibrils (PFFs) cause sustained \nupregulation of ATF4 expression in mouse cortical and mesencephalic dopaminergic \nneurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PD neurotoxins induce the expression \nof the pro-apoptotic factors Chop, Trb3, and Puma in dopaminergic neurons in an \nATF4-dependent manner. Importantly, we have determined that PD neurotoxin and \nα-synuclein PFF induced neuronal death is attenuated in ATF4-deficient \ndopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ATF4 but not \ntranscriptionally defective ATF4ΔRK restores sensitivity of ATF4-deficient \nneurons to PD neurotoxins. Finally, we demonstrate that the eIF2α kinase \ninhibitor C16 suppresses MPP+ and 6-OHDA induced ATF4 activation and protects \nagainst PD neurotoxin induced dopaminergic neuronal death. Taken together these \nresults indicate that ATF4 promotes dopaminergic cell death induced by PD \nneurotoxins and pathogenic α-synuclein aggregates and highlight the ISR factor \nATF4 as a potential therapeutic target in PD.",

Although directly targeting KRAS still is a challenge in \nanti-cancer therapies, alternatively inhibiting KRAS related signaling pathways \nhas been approached effectively. Here we firstly reported that MAP kinase, \ntransforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), commonly expressed in \nCRC cell lines and significantly associated with KRAS mutation status. \nInhibition of TAK1 by the small molecular inhibitor NG25 could inhibit CRC cells \nproliferation in vitro and in vivo, especially in KRAS-mutant cells. NG25 \ninduced caspase-dependent apoptosis in KRAS-mutant cells and in orthotopic CRC \nmouse models by regulating the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family and the \ninhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. Besides inhibiting molecules \ndownstream of MAPK, including ERK, JNK and p38 phosphorylation, NG25 could block \nNF-κB activation in KRAS-mutant cells. As a target gene of NF-κB, down-regulated \nXIAP expression may be not only involved in apoptosis induced by NG25, but also \nreducing the formation of TAK1-XIAP complex that can activate TAK1 downstream \nsignaling pathways, which forms a positive feedback loop to further induce \napoptosis in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. Together, these findings indicated that TAK1 \nis an important kinase for survival of CRCs harboring KRAS mutations, and that \nNG25 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant CRC.",

However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications \nand inactivating mutations in TRPS1 have been reported. Here, we used in vitro \nand in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary \ngland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by \nfunctional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary \nepithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling \npromotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 \nexpression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo \nsurvival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, \nthe consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined \ninactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary \norganoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results \ndemonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in \nbreast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal \nmammary epithelial cells.",

The profile of gene \nexpression changes following 6-OHDA treatment of MN9D dopaminergic neuronal \ncells was investigated using a TwinChip Mouse-7.4K microarray. Functional \nclustering of altered sets of genes identified RING-finger protein 166 (RNF166). \nRNF166 is composed of an N-terminal RING domain and C-terminal ubiquitin \ninteraction motif. RNF166 localized in the cytosol and nucleus. At the tissue \nlevel, RNF166 was widely expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral \norgans. In the cerebral cortex, its expression decreased over time. In certain \nconditions, overexpression of RNF166 accelerates the naturally occurring \nneuronal death and 6-OHDA-induced MN9D cell death as determined by TUNEL and \nannexin-V staining, and caspase activation. Consequently, 6-OHDA-induced \napoptotic cell death was attenuated in RNF166-knockdown cells. In an attempt to \nelucidate the mechanism underlying this pro-apoptotic activity, binding protein \nprofiles were assessed using the yeast two-hybrid system. Among several \npotential binding candidates, RNF166 was shown to interact with the cytoplasmic \nX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), inducing ubiquitin-dependent degradation \nof XIAP and eventually accelerating caspase activation following 6-OHDA \ntreatment. RNF166's interaction with and resulting inhibition of the XIAP \nanti-caspase activity was further enhanced by XIAP-associated factor-1 (XAF-1). \nConsequently, depletion of RNF166 suppressed 6-OHDA-induced caspase activation \nand apoptotic cell death, which was reversed by XIAP knockdown. In summary, our \ndata suggest that RNF166, a novel E3 ligase, plays a pro-apoptotic role via \ncaspase activation in neuronal cells.",

            "TEXT": "IRE1α Disruption in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cooperates with Antiangiogenic \nTherapy by Reversing ER Stress Adaptation and Remodeling the Tumor \nMicroenvironment.\n\nCancer cells exploit the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) stress caused by cellular oncogene activation and a hostile tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME). The key UPR sensor IRE1α resides in the ER and deploys a \ncytoplasmic kinase-endoribonuclease module to activate the transcription factor \nXBP1s, which facilitates ER-mediated protein folding. Studies of triple-negative \nbreast cancer (TNBC)-a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal posttreatment \nprognosis-implicate XBP1s in promoting tumor vascularization and progression. \nHowever, it remains unknown whether IRE1α adapts the ER in TNBC cells and \nmodulates their TME, and whether IRE1α inhibition can enhance antiangiogenic \ntherapy-previously found to be ineffective in patients with TNBC. To gauge IRE1α \nfunction, we defined an XBP1s-dependent gene signature, which revealed \nsignificant IRE1α pathway activation in multiple solid cancers, including TNBC. \nIRE1α knockout in TNBC cells markedly reversed substantial ultrastructural \nexpansion of their ER upon growth in vivo. IRE1α disruption also led to \nsignificant remodeling of the cellular TME, increasing pericyte numbers while \ndecreasing cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. \nPharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition strongly attenuated growth of cell \nline-based and patient-derived TNBC xenografts in mice and synergized with \nanti-VEGFA treatment to cause tumor stasis or regression. Thus, TNBC cells \ncritically rely on IRE1α to adapt their ER to in vivo stress and to adjust the \nTME to facilitate malignant growth. TNBC reliance on IRE1α is an important \nvulnerability that can be uniquely exploited in combination with antiangiogenic \ntherapy as a promising new biologic approach to combat this lethal disease. \nSIGNIFICANCE: Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition reverses ultrastructural \ndistension of the ER, normalizes the tumor vasculature, and remodels the \ncellular TME, attenuating TNBC growth in mice.",

            "TEXT": "The mitochondrial retrograde signaling regulates Wnt signaling to promote \ntumorigenesis in colon cancer.\n\nCancer cells are known to upregulate aerobic glycolysis to promote growth, \nproliferation, and survival. However, the role of mitochondrial respiration in \ntumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we report that inhibition of mitochondrial \nfunction by silencing TFAM, a key transcription factor essential for \nmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and the transcription of mtDNA-encoded \ngenes, markedly reduced tumor-initiating potential of colon cancer cells. \nKnockdown of TFAM significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration in colon \ncancer cells; however, the cellular levels of ATP remained largely unchanged as \na result of increased glycolysis. This metabolic alteration rendered cancer \ncells highly susceptible to glucose deprivation. Interestingly, upregulation of \nglycolysis was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) as TFAM \nknockdown cells fail to stabilize HIF1α under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, \nknockdown of TFAM results in decreased expression of genes-associated cancer \nstem cells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Metabolic analysis reveals \nthat the level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) was significantly upregulated in TFAM \nknockout cells. Silencing of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 \n(PHD2), a α-KG-dependent dioxyenase, rescued the expression of target genes of \nboth HIF1α and Wnt/β-catenin. Furthermore, intestinal-specific knockout of TFAM \nprevents tumor formation in Apc-mutant mouse models of colon cancer. Taken \ntogether, our findings identify a novel role of mitochondria-mediated retrograde \nsignaling in regulating Wnt signaling and tumor initiation in colon cancer.",

            "TEXT": "Endothelin 1-induced retinal ganglion cell death is largely mediated by JUN \nactivation.\n\nGlaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of retinal \nganglion cells (RGCs), the output neurons of the retina. Multiple lines of \nevidence show the endothelin (EDN, also known as ET) system is important in \nglaucomatous neurodegeneration. To date, the molecular mechanisms within RGCs \ndriving EDN-induced RGC death have not been clarified. The pro-apoptotic \ntranscription factor JUN (the canonical target of JNK signaling) and the \nendoplasmic reticulum stress effector and transcription factor DNA damage \ninducible transcript 3 (DDIT3, also known as CHOP) have been shown to act \ndownstream of EDN receptors. Previous studies demonstrated that JUN and DDIT3 \nwere important regulators of RGC death after glaucoma-relevant injures. Here, we \ncharacterized EDN insult in vivo and investigated the role of JUN and DDIT3 in \nEDN-induced RGC death. To accomplish this, EDN1 ligand was intravitreally \ninjected into the eyes of wildtype, Six3-cre+Junfl/fl (Jun-/-), Ddit3 null \n(Ddit3-/-), and Ddit3-/-Jun-/- mice. Intravitreal EDN1 was sufficient to drive \nRGC death in vivo. EDN1 insult caused JUN activation in RGCs, and deletion of \nJun from the neural retina attenuated RGC death after EDN insult. However, \ndeletion of Ddit3 did not confer significant protection to RGCs after EDN1 \ninsult. These results indicate that EDN caused RGC death via a JUN-dependent \nmechanism. In addition, EDN signaling is known to elicit potent \nvasoconstriction. JUN signaling was shown to drive neuronal death after ischemic \ninsult. Therefore, the effects of intravitreal EDN1 on retinal vessel diameter \nand hypoxia were explored. Intravitreal EDN1 caused transient retinal \nvasoconstriction and regions of RGC and Müller glia hypoxia. Thus, it remains a \npossibility that EDN elicits a hypoxic insult to RGCs, causing apoptosis via \nJNK-JUN signaling. The importance of EDN-induced vasoconstriction and hypoxia in \ncausing RGC death after EDN insult and in models of glaucoma requires further \ninvestigation.",

Sqstm1 siRNA increased senescence basally and in \nresponse to AGT II (angiotensin II) and zinc overload, two known inducers of \nsenescence. Furthermore, Sqstm1 gene deficiency mimicked the phenotype of \nPpargc1a depletion by presenting reduced autophagy and increased senescence in \nvitro and in vivo.

            "TEXT": "Deubiquitylatinase inhibitor b-AP15 induces c-Myc-Noxa-mediated apoptosis in \nesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most malignant tumors in \neast Asia. However, the molecular mechanism underlying its progression remains \nunclear. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a central mechanism for \nprotein degradation and turnover. Accumulating evidence showed that more and \nmore deubiquitinases could serve as attractive anti-cancer target. The \nexpression of USP14 and UCH37 in esophagus squamous cell carcinoma tissues were \nexamined by immunohistochemistry and western blot assays. Effect of b-AP15, a \nUSP14 and UCH37 inhibitor, on ESCC cell growth was evaluated by cell viability \nassay. After cell lines being treated with b-AP15, cell cycle, apoptosis and the \nexpression of related proteins were further explored to investigate the \nanti-ESCC mechanism of b-AP15. Results showed that deubiquitinating enzymes \n(DUBs) USP14 and UCH37 expressed at higher levels in ESCC tissues than in \nadjacent tissues. b-AP15 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce G2/M cell \ncycle arrest and apoptosis in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, b-AP15 treatment \ntriggered Noxa-dependent apoptosis, which was regulated by c-Myc. Silencing Noxa \nand c-Myc could reduce b-AP15-induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Our results \nrevealed a novel mechanism of anti-tumor activity of b-AP15 in ESCC, and b-AP15 \ncould be used as a potential therapeutic agent in ESCC.",

Here, using CD2-cre; mTORC1 \nRaptor-f/f, and mTORC2 Rictor-f/f mice (KO mice), we found that mTORC1, but not \nmTORC2, was required for the proliferation and survival of peripheral γδ T \ncells, especially Vγ4 γδ T cells. Moreover, mTORC1 was essential for both γδ T1 \nand γδ Τ17 differentiation, whereas mTORC2 was required for γδ T17, but not for \nγδ Τ1, differentiation. We further studied the underlying molecular mechanisms \nand found that depletion of mTORC1 resulted in the increased expression of \nSOCS1, which in turn suppressed the key transcription factor Eomes, \nconsequentially reducing IFN-γ production. Whereas the reduced glycolysis \nresulted in impaired γδ Τ17 differentiation in Raptor KO γδ T cells. In \ncontrast, mTORC2 potentiated γδ Τ17 induction by suppressing mitochondrial ROS \n(mitoROS) production. Consistent with their cytokine production profiles, the \nRaptor KO γδ T cells lost their anti-tumor function both in vitro and in vivo, \nwhereas both Raptor and Rictor KO mice were resistant to imiquimod (IMQ)-induced \npsoriasis-like skin pathogenesis. In summary, we identified previously unknown \nfunctions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in γδ T cell differentiation and clarified their \ndivergent roles in mediating the activity of γδ T cells in tumors and \nautoimmunity.",

As such, new targets and \ntherapeutic strategies are urgently required. Here, we show that bone \nmorphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) blocks metastasis in animal models of breast \ncancer and predicts improved survival in patients. In preclinical models of \nspontaneous metastasis, BMP4 acted as an autocrine mediator to modulate a range \nof known metastasis-regulating genes, including Smad7, via activation of \ncanonical BMP-SMAD signaling. Restored BMP4 expression or therapeutically \nadministered BMP4 protein, blocked metastasis and increased survival by \nsensitizing cancer cells to anoikis, thereby reducing the number of circulating \ntumor cells. Gene silencing of Bmp4 or its downstream mediator Smad7, reversed \nthis phenotype. Administration of recombinant BMP4 markedly reduced spontaneous \nmetastasis to lung and bone. Elevated levels of BMP4 and SMAD7 were prognostic \nfor improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients with \nbreast cancer, indicating the importance of canonical BMP4 signaling in the \nsuppression of metastasis and highlighting new avenues for therapy against \nmetastatic disease.",

            "TEXT": "Hypoxia-induced autophagy drives colorectal cancer initiation and progression by \nactivating the PRKC/PKC-EZR (ezrin) pathway.\n\nIn solid tumors, cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are \noften found in hypoxic niches. Nevertheless, the influence of hypoxia on TICs is \npoorly understood. Using previously established, TIC-enrichedpatient-derived \ncolorectal cancer (CRC) cultures, we show that hypoxia increases the \nself-renewal capacity of TICs while inducing proliferation arrest in their more \ndifferentiated counterpart cultures. Gene expression data revealed \nmacroautophagy/autophagy as one of the major pathways induced by hypoxia in \nTICs. Interestingly, hypoxia-induced autophagy was found to induce \nphosphorylation of EZR (ezrin) at Thr567 residue, which could be reversed by \nknocking down ATG5, BNIP3, BNIP3L, or BECN1. Furthermore, we identified \nPRKCA/PKCα as a potential kinase involved in hypoxia-induced autophagy-mediated \nTIC self-renewal. Genetic targeting of autophagy or pharmacological inhibition \nof PRKC/PKC and EZR resulted in decreased tumor-initiating potential of TICs. In \naddition, we observed significantly reduced in vivo tumor initiation and growth \nafter a stable knockdown of ATG5. Analysis of human CRC samples showed that \np-EZR is often present in TICs located in the hypoxic and autophagic regions of \nthe tumor. Altogether, our results establish the hypoxia-autophagy-PKC-EZR \nsignaling axis as a novel regulatory mechanism of TIC self-renewal and CRC \nprogression. Autophagy inhibition might thus represent a promising therapeutic \nstrategy for cancer patients.",

CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 3 (CNOT3), a \npost-translational regulator, is suggested to be involved in cancer development \nand progression. However, its role in chemotherapeutic resistance is not well \nunderstood. In this study, after screening the CNOT3 mRNA in a cancer microarray \ndatabase called Oncomine and examining the expression levels of CNOT3 mRNA in \nnormal tissues and lung cancer tissues, we found that CNOT3 was up-regulated in \nlung cancer tissues. Besides, its high-expression was associated with poor \nprognosis of lung cancer patients. We also found higher expression level of \nCNOT3 and lower expression level of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 \n(RIPK3) in cisplatin-resistant A549 (A549/DDP) cells, and knocking down CNOT3 \nexpression could sensitize A549/DDP cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We \ndemonstrated that CNOT3 depletion up-regulated the expression level of RIPK3 and \nthe enhanced apoptosis was mediated by the elevated RIPK3 to further trigger \nCaspase 8 activation. Taken together, our results reveal a role of CNOT3 in \ncisplatin resistance of lung cancer and provide a potential target for lung \ncancer therapy.",

Increasing studies have found that TMZ treatment \ncould induce autophagy that may link to therapeutic resistance in GBM, but, the \nprecise mechanisms are not fully understood. Understanding the molecular \nmechanisms underlying the response of GBM to chemotherapy is paramount for \ndeveloping improved cancer therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrated that the \nloss of DOC-2/DAB2 interacting protein (DAB2IP) is responsible for \nTMZ-resistance in GBM through ATG9B. DAB2IP sensitized GBM to TMZ and suppressed \nTMZ-induced autophagy by negatively regulating ATG9B expression. A higher level \nof ATG9B expression was associated with GBM compared to low-grade glioma. The \nknockdown of ATG9B expression in GBM cells suppressed TMZ-induced autophagy as \nwell as TMZ-resistance. Furthermore, we showed that DAB2IP negatively regulated \nATG9B expression by blocking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. To enhance the benefit \nof TMZ and avoid therapeutic resistance, effective combination strategies were \ntested using a small molecule inhibitor blocking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in \naddition to TMZ. The combination treatment synergistically enhanced the efficacy \nof TMZ in GBM cells. In conclusion, the present study identified the mechanisms \nof TMZ-resistance of GBM mediated by DAB2IP and ATG9B which provides insight \ninto a potential strategy to overcome TMZ chemo-resistance.",

While both paradigms of metabolic \nstress dampen MTOR signaling, they affect the autophagy pathway differently. \nFurther, we find that starvation-induced autophagic flux is dependent on the \nbuffering system of the starvation solution. Lastly, starvation conditions that \nstrongly activate autophagy in astrocytes have less pronounced effects on \nautophagy in neurons. Combined, our study reveals the complexity of regulating \nautophagy in different paradigms of metabolic stress, as well as in different \ncell types of the brain.

The phosphoinositide \nphosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) effector Atg18 is essential for \nautophagosome formation in yeast. Mammalian cells contain four Atg18 homologs, \nbelonging to two subclasses, WIPI1 (WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide \ninteracting 1), WIPI2 and WDR45B/WIPI3 (WD repeat domain 45B), WDR45/WIPI4. The \nrole of Wdr45b in autophagy and in neural homeostasis, however, remains unknown. \nRecent human genetic studies have revealed a potential causative role of WDR45B \nin intellectual disability. Here we demonstrated that mice deficient in Wdr45b \nexhibit motor deficits and learning and memory defects. Histological analysis \nreveals that wdr45b knockout (KO) mice exhibit a large number of swollen axons \nand show cerebellar atrophy. SQSTM1- and ubiquitin-positive aggregates, which \nare autophagy substrates, accumulate in various brain regions in wdr45b KO mice. \nDouble KO mice, wdr45b and wdr45, die within one day after birth and exhibit \nmore severe autophagy defects than either of the single KO mice, suggesting that \nthese two genes act cooperatively in autophagy. Our studies demonstrated that \nWDR45B is critical for neural homeostasis in mice. The wdr45b KO mice provide a \nmodel to study the pathogenesis of intellectual disability.",

In this study, we \ninvestigated whether PAQR3 modulates EGFR-mediated autophagy and whether such \nregulation is associated with the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3. PAQR3 is \nable to inhibit the in vitro and in vivo growth of non-small cell lung cancer \n(NSCLC) cells. PAQR3 potentiates autophagy induced by EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. \nKnockdown of PAQR3 abrogates erlotinib-mediated reduction of BECN1 interaction \nwith autophagy inhibitory proteins RUBCN/Rubicon and BCL2. PAQR3 blocks the \ninteraction of BECN1 with the activated form of EGFR and inhibits tyrosine \nphosphorylation of BECN1. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by knocking down \nATG7 abrogates the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3 in NSCLC cells. \nCollectively, these data indicate that PAQR3 suppresses tumor progression of \nNSCLC cells through modulating EGFR-regulated autophagy.",

A newly reported circular RNA \nHIPK3 (circHIPK3) is critical in cell proliferation of various cancer types, \nalthough its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has yet to be \nelucidated. Our results provided evidence that silencing of circHIPK3 \nsignificantly impaired cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induced \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Mechanistically, we uncovered that autophagy was \ninduced upon loss of circHIPK3 via the MIR124-3p-STAT3-PRKAA/AMPKa axis in STK11 \nmutant lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H838). STAT3 abrogation as well as \ntransfection with a MIR124-3p mimic, recapitulated the induction of autophagy. \nWe also demonstrated antagonistic regulation on autophagy between circHIPK3 and \nlinear HIPK3 (linHIPK3). We therefore propose that the ratio between circHIPK3 \nand linHIPK3 (C:L ratio) may reflect autophagy levels in cancer cells. We \nobserved that a high C:L ratio (>0.49) was an indicator of poor survival, \nespecially in advanced-stage NSCLC patients. These results support that \ncircHIPK3 is a key autophagy regulator in a subset of lung cancer and has \npotential clinical use as a prognostic factor. The circular RNA HIPK3 \n(circHIPK3) functions as an oncogene and autophagy regulator may potential use \nas a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in lung cancer.",

            "TEXT": "USP10 Promotes Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Deubiquitinating and \nStabilizing YAP/TAZ.\n\nYes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with \nPDZ-binding motif (TAZ), play pivotal roles in promoting the progression of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism underpinning \naberrant activation of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In \nthis study, we globally profiled the contribution of deubiquitinating enzymes \n(DUB) to both transcriptional activity and protein abundance of YAP/TAZ in \nhepatocellular carcinoma models and identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 \n(USP10) as a potent YAP/TAZ-activating DUB. Mechanistically, USP10 directly \ninteracted with and stabilized YAP/TAZ by reverting their proteolytic \nubiquitination. Depletion of USP10 enhanced polyubiquitination of YAP/TAZ, \npromoted their proteasomal degradation, and ultimately arrested the \nproliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Expression \nlevels of USP10 positively correlated with the abundance of YAP/TAZ in \nhepatocellular carcinoma patient samples as well as in N-nitrosodiethylamine \n(DEN)-induced liver cancer mice models. Collectively, this study establishes the \ncausal link between USP10 and hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma \ncells and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the \ntreatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma harboring a high level of \nYAP/TAZ. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify USP10 as a DUB of YAP/TAZ and its \nrole in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, which may serve as a potential \ntherapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.",

            "TEXT": "HDAC6 differentially regulates autophagy in stem-like versus differentiated \ncancer cells.\n\nCancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a small population of pluripotent cells residing \nwithin heterogeneous tumor mass, remain highly resistant to various \nchemotherapies as compared to the differentiated cancer cells. It is being \npostulated that CSCs possess unique molecular mechanisms, such as autophagic \nhomeostasis, that allow CSCs to withstand the therapeutic assaults. Here we \ndemonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition differentially modulates \nmacroautophagy/autophagy in CSCs as compared to that of differentiated cancer \ncells. Using human and murine CSC models and differentiated cells, we show that \nthe inhibition or knockdown (KD) of HDAC6 decreases CSC pluripotency by \ndownregulating major pluripotency factors POU5F1, NANOG and SOX2. This decreased \nHDAC6 expression increases ACTB, TUBB3 and CSN2 expression and promotes \ndifferentiation in CSCs in an apoptosis-independent manner. Mechanistically, \nHDAC6 KD in CSCs decreases pluripotency by promoting autophagy, whereas the \ninhibition of pluripotency via retinoic acid treatment, POU5F1 or \nautophagy-related gene (ATG7 and ATG12) KD in CSCs decreases HDAC6 expression \nand promotes differentiation. Interestingly, HDAC6 KD-mediated CSC growth \ninhibition is further enhanced in the presence of autophagy inducers Tat-Beclin \n1 peptide and rapamycin. In contrast to the results observed in CSCs, HDAC6 KD \nin differentiated breast cancer cells downregulates autophagy and increases \napoptosis. Furthermore, the autophagy regulator p-MTOR, upstream negative \nregulators of p-MTOR (TSC1 and TSC2) and downstream effectors of p-MTOR \n(p-RPS6KB and p-EIF4EBP1) are differentially regulated in CSCs versus \ndifferentiated cancer cells following HDAC6 KD. Overall these data identify the \ndifferential regulation of autophagy as a molecular link behind the differing \nchemo-susceptibility of CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.",

The activity of mammalian sterile20-like kinases (MST1/2) has been \nlinked to apoptosis and tumor suppression via YAP/Hippo pathway-independent and \n-dependent mechanisms. Using a kinase substrate screen, we identified here MST1 \nand MST2 among the top substrates for fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 \n(FGFR4). In COS-1 cells, MST1 was phosphorylated at Y433 residue in an FGFR4 \nkinase activity-dependent manner, as assessed by mass spectrometry. Blockade of \nthis phosphorylation by Y433F mutation induced MST1 activation, as indicated by \nincreased threonine phosphorylation of MST1/2, and the downstream substrate \nMOB1, in FGFR4-overexpressing T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. \nImportantly, the specific knockdown or short-term inhibition of FGFR4 in \nendogenous models of human HER2+ breast cancer cells likewise led to increased \nMST1/2 activation, in conjunction with enhanced MST1 nuclear localization and \ngeneration of N-terminal cleaved and autophosphorylated MST1. Unexpectedly, MST2 \nwas also essential for this MST1/N activation and coincident apoptosis \ninduction, although these two kinases, as well as YAP, were differentially \nregulated in the breast cancer models analyzed. Moreover, pharmacological FGFR4 \ninhibition specifically sensitized the HER2+ MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, not \nonly to HER2/EGFR and AKT/mTOR inhibitors, but also to clinically relevant \napoptosis modulators. In TCGA cohort, FGFR4 overexpression correlated with \nabysmal HER2+ breast carcinoma patient outcome. Therefore, our results uncover a \nclinically relevant, targetable mechanism of FGFR4 oncogenic activity via \nsuppression of the stress-associated MST1/2-induced apoptosis machinery in tumor \ncells with prominent HER/ERBB and FGFR4 signaling-driven proliferation.",

            "TEXT": "EZH2-Mediated Downregulation of the Tumor Suppressor DAB2IP Maintains Ovarian \nCancer Stem Cells.\n\nThe majority of women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer eventually \ndevelop recurrence, which rapidly evolves into chemoresistant disease. \nPersistence of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) at the end of therapy may be \nresponsible for emergence of resistant tumors. In this study, we demonstrate \nthat in OCSC, the tumor suppressor disabled homolog 2-interacting protein \n(DAB2IP) is silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation of the DAB2IP \npromoter. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of DAB2IP in epithelial ovarian cancer \ncell lines upregulated expression of stemness-related genes and induced \nconversion of non-CSC to CSC, while enforced expression of DAB2IP suppressed CSC \nproperties. Transcriptomic analysis showed that overexpression of DAB2IP in \novarian cancer significantly altered stemness-associated genes and bioinformatic \nanalysis revealed WNT signaling as a dominant pathway mediating the CSC \ninhibitory effect of DAB2IP. Specifically, DAB2IP inhibited WNT signaling via \ndownregulation of WNT5B, an important stemness inducer. Reverse phase protein \narray further demonstrated activation of noncanonical WNT signaling via C-JUN as \na downstream target of WNT5B, which was blocked by inhibiting RAC1, a prominent \nregulator of C-JUN activation. Coadministration of EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and \nRAC1 inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed OCSC survival in vitro and inhibited tumor \ngrowth and increased platinum sensitivity in vivo. Overall, these data establish \nthat DAB2IP suppresses the cancer stem cell phenotype via inhibition of \nWNT5B-induced activation of C-JUN and can be epigenetically silenced by EZH2 in \nOCSC. Targeting the EZH2/DAB2IP/C-JUN axis therefore presents a promising \nstrategy to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence and has potential for clinical \ntranslation.",

Searching for strategies that would extend the \nuse of PARP inhibitors to BRCA1-proficient tumors, we found that the stability \nof BRCA1 protein following ionizing radiation (IR) is maintained by \npostphosphorylational prolyl-isomerization adjacent to Ser1191 of BRCA1, \ncatalyzed by prolyl-isomerase Pin1. Extinction of Pin1 decreased homologous \nrecombination (HR) to the level of BRCA1-deficient cells. Pin1 stabilizes BRCA1 \nby preventing ubiquitination of Lys1037 of BRCA1. Loss of Pin1, or introduction \nof a BRCA1-mutant refractory to Pin1 binding, decreased the ability of BRCA1 to \nlocalize to repair foci and augmented IR-induced DNA damage. In vitro growth of \nHR-proficient breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer cells were modestly \nrepressed by olaparib or Pin1 inhibition using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), \nwhile combination treatment resulted in near-complete block of cell \nproliferation. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts and triple-negative breast cancer \npatient-derived xenografts, either loss of Pin1 or ATRA treatment reduced BRCA1 \nexpression and sensitized breast tumors to olaparib. Together, our study reveals \nthat Pin1 inhibition, with clinical widely used ATRA, acts as an effective HR \ndisrupter that sensitizes BRCA1-proficient tumors to PARP inhibition.",

            "TEXT": "OTULIN protects the liver against cell death, inflammation, fibrosis, and \ncancer.\n\nMethionine-1 (M1)-linked polyubiquitin chains conjugated by the linear ubiquitin \nchain assembly complex (LUBAC) control NF-κB activation, immune homoeostasis, \nand prevents tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death. The deubiquitinase \nOTULIN negatively regulates M1-linked polyubiquitin signalling by removing the \nchains conjugated by LUBAC, and OTULIN deficiency causes OTULIN-related \nautoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS) in humans. However, the cellular pathways and \nphysiological functions controlled by OTULIN remain poorly understood. Here, we \nshow that OTULIN prevents development of liver disease in mice and humans. In an \nORAS patient, OTULIN deficiency caused spontaneous and progressive steatotic \nliver disease at 10-13 months of age. Similarly, liver-specific deletion of \nOTULIN in mice leads to neonatally onset steatosis and hepatitis, akin to the \nORAS patient. OTULIN deficiency triggers metabolic alterations, apoptosis, and \ninflammation in the liver. In mice, steatosis progresses to steatohepatitis, \nfibrosis and pre-malignant tumour formation by 8 weeks of age, and by the age of \n7-12 months the phenotype has advanced to malignant hepatocellular carcinoma. \nSurprisingly, the pathology in OTULIN-deficient livers is independent of TNFR1 \nsignalling. Instead, we find that steatohepatitis in OTULIN-deficient livers is \nassociated with aberrant mTOR activation, and inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin \nadministration significantly reduces the liver pathology. Collectively, our \nresults reveal that OTULIN is critical for maintaining liver homoeostasis and \nsuggest that M1-linked polyubiquitin chains may play a role in regulation of \nmTOR signalling and metabolism in the liver.",

            "TEXT": "AMPK activation does not enhance autophagy in neurons in contrast to MTORC1 \ninhibition: different impact on β-amyloid clearance.\n\nThe physiological AKT-MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways are considered key \nnodes in the regulation of anabolism-catabolism, and particularly of \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Indeed, it is reported that these are altered \nprocesses in neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD), \nmainly characterized by deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated MAPT. \nThese accumulations disrupt the optimal neuronal proteostasis, and hence, the \nrecovery/enhancement of autophagy has been proposed as a therapeutic approach \nagainst these proteinopathies. The purpose of the present study was to \ncharacterize the modulation of autophagy by MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways \nin the highly specialized neurons, as well as their repercussions on Aβ \nproduction. Using a double transgenic mice model of AD, we demonstrated that \nMTORC1 inhibition, either in vivo or ex vivo (primary neuronal cultures), was \nable to reduce amyloid secretion through moderate autophagy induction in \nneurons. The pharmacological prevention of autophagy in neurons augmented the Aβ \nsecretion and reversed the effect of rapamycin, confirming the \nanti-amyloidogenic effects of autophagy in neurons. Inhibition of AMPK with \ncompound C generated the expected decrease in autophagy induction, though \nsurprisingly did not increase the Aβ secretion. In contrast, increased activity \nof AMPK with metformin, AICAR, 2DG, or by gene overexpression did not enhance \nautophagy but had different effects on Aβ secretion: whereas metformin and 2DG \ndiminished the secreted Aβ levels, AICAR and PRKAA1/AMPK gene overexpression \nincreased them. We conclude that AMPK has a significantly different role in \nprimary neurons than in other reported cells, lacking a direct effect on \nautophagy-dependent amyloidosis.",

Previous studies suggested that metadherin (MTDH) is involved in the \ndevelopment of colorectal and lung cancers. However, how MTDH regulates the \npathogenesis of these cancers remains largely unknown. Using genetically \nmodified mouse models of spontaneous colorectal and lung cancers, we found that \nMTDH promotes cancer progression by facilitating Wnt activation and by inducing \ncytotoxic T-cell exhaustion, respectively. Moreover, we developed locked nucleic \nacid-modified (LNA) MTDH antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) that effectively and \nspecifically suppress MTDH expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatments with MTDH \nASOs in mouse models significantly attenuated progression and metastasis of \ncolorectal, lung, and breast cancers. Our study opens a new avenue for \ndeveloping therap",

Therefore, there is an unmet \nneed for novel treatment options for RASMT mCRC. RALA and RALB GTPases function \ndownstream of RAS and have been found to be key regulators of several cell \nfunctions implicated in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis. However, their role as \nregulators of the apoptotic machinery remains to be elucidated. Here, we found \nthat inhibition of RALB expression, but not RALA, resulted in \nCaspase-8-dependent cell death in KRASMT CRC cells, which was not further \nincreased following MEK1/2 inhibition. Proteomic analysis and mechanistic \nstudies revealed that RALB depletion induced a marked upregulation of the \npro-apoptotic cell surface TRAIL Death Receptor 5 (DR5) (also known as \nTRAIL-R2), primarily through modulating DR5 protein lysosomal degradation. \nMoreover, DR5 knockdown or knockout attenuated siRALB-induced apoptosis, \nconfirming the role of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway as a regulator of \nsiRALB-induced cell death. Importantly, TRAIL treatment resulted in the \nassociation of RALB with the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and \ntargeting RALB using pharmacologic inhibition or RNAi approaches triggered a \npotent increase in TRAIL-induced cell death in KRASMT CRC cells. Significantly, \nhigh RALB mRNA levels were found in the poor prognostic Colorectal Cancer \nIntrinsic Subtypes (CRIS)-B CRC subgroup. Collectively, this study provides to \nour knowledge the first evidence for a role for RALB in apoptotic priming and \nsuggests that RALB inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve response to \nTRAIL treatment in poor prognostic RASMT CRIS-B CRC.",

            "TEXT": "GPD1 Enhances the Anticancer Effects of Metformin by Synergistically Increasing \nTotal Cellular Glycerol-3-Phosphate.\n\nMetformin is an oral drug widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of metformin in cancer \ntreatment. However, for metformin to elicit effects on cancer often requires a \nhigh dosage, and any underlying mechanism for how to improve its inhibitory \neffects remains unknown. Here, we found that low mRNA expression of \nglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) may predict a poor response to \nmetformin treatment in 15 cancer cell lines. In vitro and in vivo, metformin \ntreatment alone significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, a phenotype \nenhanced by GPD1 overexpression. Total cellular glycerol-3-phosphate \nconcentration was significantly increased by the combination of GPD1 \noverexpression and metformin treatment, which suppressed cancer growth via \ninhibition of mitochondrial function. Eventually, increased reactive oxygen \nspecies and mitochondrial structural damage was observed in GPD1-overexpressing \ncell lines treated with metformin, which may contribute to cell death. In \nsummary, this study demonstrates that GPD1 overexpression enhances the \nanticancer activity of metformin and that patients with increased GPD1 \nexpression in tumor cells may respond better to metformin therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: \nGPD1 overexpression enhances the anticancer effect of metformin through \nsynergistic inhibition of mitochondrial function, thereby providing new insight \ninto metformin-mediated cancer therapy.",

            "TEXT": "CD9 induces cellular senescence and aggravates atherosclerotic plaque formation.\n\nCD9, a 24 kDa tetraspanin membrane protein, is known to regulate cell adhesion \nand migration, cancer progression and metastasis, immune and allergic responses, \nand viral infection. CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, \nneointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in \ncellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the \npotential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in \natherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical \nvein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 \nupregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular \nsenescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. \nCD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and \nin atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody \nnoticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice \nand Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased \natherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that \nCD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the \npathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for \nprevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.",

            "TEXT": "Two-factor specification of apoptosis: TGF-β signaling acts cooperatively with \necdysone signaling to induce cell- and stage-specific apoptosis of larval \nneurons during metamorphosis in Drosophila melanogaster.\n\nDevelopmentally regulated programmed cell death (PCD) is one of the key cellular \nevents for precise controlling of neuronal population during postembryonic \ndevelopment of the central nervous system. Previously we have shown that a group \nof corazonin-producing peptidergic neurons (vCrz) undergo apoptosis in response \nto ecdysone signaling via ecdysone receptor (EcR)-B isoforms and Ultraspiracle \nduring early phase of metamorphosis. Further utilizing genetic, transgenic, and \nmosaic analyses, we have found that TGF-β signaling mediated by a glia-produced \nligand, Myoglianin, type-I receptor Baboon (particularly Babo-A isoform) and \ndSmad2, is also required autonomously for PCD of the vCrz neurons. Our studies \nshow that TGF-β signaling is not acting epistatically to EcR or vice versa. We \nalso show that ectopic expression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic form \nof dSmad2 (dSmad2PM) is capable of inducing premature death of vCrz neurons in \nlarva but not other larval neurons. Intriguingly, the dSmad2PM-mediated killing \nis completely suppressed by coexpression of a dominant-negative form of EcR \n(EcRDN), suggesting that EcR function is required for the proapoptotic dSmad2PM \nfunction. Based on these data, we suggest that TGF-β and ecdysone signaling \npathways act cooperatively to induce vCrz neuronal PCD. We propose that this \ntype of two-factor authentication is a key developmental strategy to ensure the \ntimely PCD of specific larval neurons during metamorphosis.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying \nhigh, constitutive NF-κB activity in GBM remains to be elucidated. Here, we \nscreened a panel of tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins and identified \nTRIM22 as a potential activator of NF-κB using an NF-κB driven luciferase \nreporter construct in GBM cell lines. Knockout of TRIM22 using Cas9-sgRNAs led \nto reduced GBM cell proliferation, while TRIM22 overexpression enhanced \nproliferation of cell populations, in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft \nmodel. However, two TRIM22 mutants, one with a critical RING-finger domain \ndeletion and the other with amino acid changes at two active sites of RING E3 \nligase (C15/18A), were both unable to promote GBM cell proliferation over \ncontrols, thus implicating E3 ligase activity in the growth-promoting properties \nof TRIM22. Co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that TRIM22 bound a negative \nregulator of NF-κB, NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα), and accelerated its \ndegradation by inducing K48-linked ubiquitination. TRIM22 also formed a complex \nwith the NF-κB upstream regulator IKKγ and promoted K63-linked ubiquitination, \nwhich led to the phosphorylation of both IKKα/β and IκBα. Expression of a \nnon-phosphorylation mutant, srIκBα, inhibited the growth-promoting properties of \nTRIM22 in GBM cell lines. Finally, TRIM22 was increased in a cohort of primary \nGBM samples on a tissue microarray, and high expression of TRIM22 correlated \nwith other clinical parameters associated with progressive gliomas, such as \nwild-type IDH1 status. In summary, our study revealed that TRIM22 activated \nNF-κB signaling through posttranslational modification of two critical \nregulators of NF-κB signaling in GBM cells.",

            "TEXT": "ETV4 Is Necessary for Estrogen Signaling and Growth in Endometrial Cancer Cells.\n\nEstrogen signaling through estrogen receptor alpha (ER) plays a major role in \nendometrial cancer risk and progression, however, the molecular mechanisms \nunderlying ER's regulatory role in endometrial cancer are poorly understood. In \nbreast cancer cells, ER genomic binding is enabled by FOXA1 and GATA3, but the \ntranscription factors that control ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer \ncells remain unknown. We previously identified ETV4 as a candidate factor \ncontrolling ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer cells, and here we explore \nthe functional importance of ETV4. Homozygous deletion of ETV4, using \nCRISPR/Cas9, led to greatly reduced ER binding at the majority of loci normally \nbound by ER. Consistent with the dramatic loss of ER binding, the gene \nexpression response to estradiol was dampened for most genes. ETV4 contributes \nto estrogen signaling in two distinct ways. ETV4 loss affects chromatin \naccessibility at some ER bound loci and impairs ER nuclear translocation. The \ndiminished estrogen signaling upon ETV4 deletion led to decreased growth, \nparticularly in 3D culture, where hollow organoids were formed and in vivo in \nthe context of estrogen-dependent growth. These results show that ETV4 plays an \nimportant role in estrogen signaling in endometrial cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: \nEstrogen receptor alpha (ER) is a key oncogene in endometrial cancer. This study \nuncovers ETV4 as an important factor in controlling the activity of ER and the \ngrowth of endometrial cancer cells.",

Here, we employ modern genetic tools to \nevaluate the role of G6PD in lung, breast, and colon cancer driven by oncogenic \nK-Ras. Human HCT116 colorectal cancer cells lacking G6PD exhibited metabolic \nindicators of oxidative stress, but developed into subcutaneous xenografts with \ngrowth comparable with that of wild-type controls. In a genetically engineered \nmouse model of non-small cell lung cancer driven by K-Ras G12D and p53 \ndeficiency, G6PD knockout did not block formation or proliferation of primary \nlung tumors. In MDA-MB-231-derived human triple-negative breast cancer cells \nimplanted as orthotopic xenografts, loss of G6PD modestly decreased primary site \ngrowth without ablating spontaneous metastasis to the lung and moderately \nimpaired the ability of breast cancer cells to colonize the lung when delivered \nvia tail vein injection. Thus, in the studied K-Ras tumor models, G6PD was not \nstrictly essential for tumorigenesis and at most modestly promoted disease \nprogression.

It is known to result from iron-dependent \naccumulation of lipid peroxides rather than caspase activation. However, we \nreported recently that ferroptosis interplays with apoptosis. In this study, we \ninvestigated a possible mechanism of this interplay between ferroptosis and \napoptosis. Results from our studies reveal that combined treatment of the \nferroptotic agent erastin and the apoptotic agent TRAIL effectively disrupted \nmitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and subsequently promoted caspase \nactivation. The alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential are probably due \nto an increase in oligomerization of BAX and its accumulation at the \nmitochondria during treatment with erastin and TRAIL. Interestingly, the \ncombined treatment-promoted apoptosis was effectively inhibited in BAX-deficient \nHCT116 cells, but not BAK-deficient cells. These results indicate that the \nBAX-associated mitochondria-dependent pathway plays a pivotal role in \nerastin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis.",

Numerous \nforms of cardiomyopathies share a common end-pathway in which apoptotic loss of \ncardiomyocytes is mediated by p38α mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). \nAlthough we have previously shown that palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty \nacid (SFA) elevated in plasma of type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity, \ninduces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via p38α MAPK-dependent signaling, the \ndownstream cascade events that cause cell death remain unknown. The objective of \nthis study was to investigate mechanisms involved in palmitic acid-induced \ncardiomyocyte apoptosis. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte line (AC16 cells) \nexposed to high physiological levels of PA for 16 h showed enhanced \ntranscription and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun subunits of AP-1 and \ntranscription of caspase 8. When AC16 cells were transfected with small \ninterfering RNA specific against p38α MAPK (si-p38α) for 24 or 48 h, the \namplified phosphorylation of c-fos was dose-dependently attenuated, and \nprocaspase 8 was dose-dependently reduced. With translational knockdown of \nc-fos, PA-induced apoptosis was diminished. Inhibition of caspase 8 for 24 h \nreduced apoptosis in PA-treated cardiomyocytes. These findings provide evidence \nfor induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to high SFA by a novel \npathway requiring activation of c-fos/AP-1 and caspase 8. These results \ndemonstrate how elevated plasma SFA may lead to continual and cumulative loss of \ncardiomyocytes and potentially contribute to the development of diabetic \ncardiomyopathy.",

            "TEXT": "Caspase cleavage of transcription factor Sp1 enhances apoptosis.\n\nSp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates many genes involved in \napoptosis and senescence. Sp1 also has a role in the DNA damage response; at low \nlevels of DNA damage, Sp1 is phosphorylated by ATM and localizes to \ndouble-strand break sites where it facilitates DNA double-strand-break repair. \nDepletion of Sp1 increases the sensitivity of cells to DNA damage, whereas \noverexpression of Sp1 can drive cells into apoptosis. In response to a variety \nof stimuli, Sp1 can be regulated through proteolytic cleavage by caspases and/or \ndegradation. Here, we show that activation of apoptosis through DNA damage or \nTRAIL-mediated activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway induces \ncaspase-mediated cleavage of Sp1. Cleavage of Sp1 was coincident with the \nappearance of cleaved caspase 3, and produced a 70 kDa Sp1 product. In vitro \nanalysis revealed a novel caspase cleavage site at aspartic acid 183. Mutation \nof aspartic acid 183 to alanine conferred resistance to cleavage, and ectopic \nexpression of the Sp1 D183A rendered cells resistant to apoptotic stimuli, \nindicating that Sp1 cleavage is involved in the induction of apoptosis. The \n70 kDa product resulting from caspase cleavage of Sp1 comprises amino acids \n184-785. This truncated form, designated Sp1-70C, which retains transcriptional \nactivity, induced apoptosis when overexpressed in normal epithelial cells, \nwhereas Sp1D183A induced significantly less apoptosis. Together, these data \nreveal a new caspase cleavage site in Sp1 and demonstrate for the first time \nthat caspase cleavage of Sp1 promotes apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "Tumor Fibroblast-Derived FGF2 Regulates Expression of SPRY1 in Esophageal \nTumor-Infiltrating T Cells and Plays a Role in T-cell Exhaustion.\n\nT-cell exhaustion was initially identified in chronic infection in mice and was \nsubsequently described in humans with cancer. Although the distinct signature of \nexhausted T (TEX) cells in cancer has been well investigated, the molecular \nmechanism of T-cell exhaustion in cancer is not fully understood. Using \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing, we report here that TEX cells in esophageal cancer \nare more heterogeneous than previously clarified. Sprouty RTK signaling \nantagonist 1 (SPRY1) was notably enriched in two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T \ncells. When overexpressed, SPRY1 impaired T-cell activation by interacting with \nCBL, a negative regulator of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation. Data from the \nTumor Immune Estimation Resource revealed a strong correlation between FGF2 and \nSPRY1 expression in esophageal cancer. High expression of FGF2 was evident in \nfibroblasts from esophageal cancer tissue and correlated with poor overall \nsurvival. In vitro administration of FGF2 significantly upregulated expression \nof SPRY1 in CD8+ T cells and attenuated T-cell receptor-triggered CD8+ T-cell \nactivation. A mouse tumor model confirmed that overexpression of FGF2 in \nfibroblasts significantly upregulated SPRY1 expression in TEX cells, impaired \nT-cell cytotoxic activity, and promoted tumor growth. Thus, these findings \nidentify FGF2 as an important regulator of SPRY1 expression involved in \nestablishing the dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells in esophageal cancer.",

Caspase-8 inhibits necroptosis by suppressing the \nfunction of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1 or RIP1) and RIPK3 to \nactivate mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Disruption of Caspase-8 \nexpression causes embryonic lethality in mice, which is rescued by depletion of \neither Ripk3 or Mlkl, indicating that the embryonic lethality is caused by \nactivation of necroptosis. Here, we show that knockdown of Caspase-8 expression \nin embryoid bodies derived from ES cells markedly enhances retinoic acid \n(RA)-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis, both of which are dependent \non Ripk1 and Ripk3; however, the enhancement of RA-induced cell differentiation \nis independent of Mlkl and necrosome formation. RA treatment obviously enhanced \nthe expression of RA-specific target genes having the retinoic acid response \nelement (RARE) in their promoter regions to induce cell differentiation, and \ninduced marked expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL to stimulate necroptosis. \nCaspase-8 knockdown induced RIPK1 and RIPK3 to translocate into the nucleus and \nto form a complex with RA receptor (RAR), and RAR interacting with RIPK1 and \nRIPK3 showed much stronger binding activity to RARE than RAR without RIPK1 or \nRIPK3. In Caspase-8-deficient as well as Caspase-8- and Mlkl-deficient mouse \nembryos, the expression of RA-specific target genes was obviously enhanced. \nThus, Caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3 regulate RA-induced cell differentiation and \nnecroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.",

            "TEXT": "Stromal SNAI2 Is Required for ERBB2 Breast Cancer Progression.\n\nSNAI2 overexpression appears to be associated with poor prognosis in breast \ncancer, yet it remains unclear in which breast cancer subtypes this occurs. Here \nwe show that excess SNAI2 is associated with a poor prognosis of luminal B \nHER2+/ERBB2+ breast cancers in which SNAI2 expression in the stroma but not the \nepithelium correlates with tumor proliferation. To determine how stromal SNAI2 \nmight influence HER2+ tumor behavior, Snai2-deficient mice were crossed with a \nmouse line carrying the ErbB2/Neu protooncogene to generate HER2+/ERBB2+ breast \ncancer. Tumors generated in this model expressed SNAI2 in the stroma but not the \nepithelium, allowing for the role of stromal SNAI2 to be studied without \ninterference from the epithelial compartment. The absence of SNAI2 in the stroma \nof HER2+/ERBB2+ tumors is associated with: (i) lower levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) \nand reduced tumor epithelium proliferation; (ii) higher levels of AKT and a \nlower incidence of metastasis; (iii) lower levels of angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), \nand more necrosis. Together, these results indicate that the loss of SNAI2 in \ncancer-associated fibroblasts limits the production of some cytokines, which \ninfluences AKT/ERK tumor signaling and subsequent proliferative and metastatic \ncapacity of ERBB2+ breast cancer cells. Accordingly, SNAI2 expression in the \nstroma enhanced the tumorigenicity of luminal B HER2+/ERBB2+ breast cancers. \nThis work emphasizes the importance of stromal SNAI2 in breast cancer \nprogression and patients' prognosis.",

            "TEXT": "TNF-α-elicited miR-29b potentiates resistance to apoptosis in peripheral blood \nmonocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nCD14-positive monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more \nresistant to apoptosis, which promotes their persistence at the inflammatory \nsite and thereby contributes crucially to immunopathology. We sought to \nelucidate one mechanism underlying this unique pathogenesis: resistance to \napoptosis and the potential involvement of miR-29b in this process. \nCD14-positive peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) from RA patients were observed \nto be resistant to spontaneous apoptosis compared to PBMs from healthy \nvolunteers. Intriguingly, expression of miR-29b was significantly upregulated in \nPBMs from RA patients than those from healthy volunteers, and this upregulation \nwas correlated with RA disease activity. Functionally, forced expression of the \nexogenous miR-29b in CD14-positive Ctrl PBMs conferred resistance to spontaneous \napoptosis and Fas-induced death, thereafter enhancing the production of major \nproinflammatory cytokines in there cells. Following identification of the \npotential miR-29b target transcripts using bioinformatic algorithms, we showed \nthat miR-29b could directly bind to the 3'-UTR of the high-mobility group \nbox-containing protein 1 (HBP1) and inhibited its transcription in PBMs. \nImportantly, stable expression of the exogenous HBP1 in differentiated THP-1 \nmonocytes effectively abolished miR-29b-elicited resistance to Fas-induced \napoptosis. Finally, among patients with RA and good clinical responses to \nimmunotherapy, expression levels of miR-29b were significantly compromised in \nthose treated with infliximab (a TNF-α inhibitor) but not in those treated with \ntocilizumab (a humanized mAb against the IL-6 receptor), pointing to a potential \nassociation between miR-29b activation and TNF-α induction. The available data \ncollectively suggest that TNF-α-elicited miR-29b potentiates resistance to \napoptosis in PBMs from RA patients via inhibition of HBP1 signaling, and testing \npatients for miR-29b/HBP1 expression ratios may provide more accurate prognostic \ninformation and could influence the recommended course of immunotherapy.",

Several YAP1 \ngene fusions have been identified in various human cancers and identifying the \nessential components of this family of gene fusions has significant therapeutic \nvalue. Here, we show that the YAP1 gene fusions YAP1-MAMLD1, YAP1-FAM118B, \nYAP1-TFE3, and YAP1-SS18 are oncogenic in mice. Using reporter assays, RNA-seq, \nChIP-seq, and loss-of-function mutations, we can show that all of these YAP1 \nfusion proteins exert TEAD-dependent YAP activity, while some also exert \nactivity of the C'-terminal fusion partner. The YAP activity of the different \nYAP1 fusions is resistant to negative Hippo pathway regulation due to \nconstitutive nuclear localization and resistance to degradation of the YAP1 \nfusion proteins. Genetic disruption of the TEAD-binding domain of these \noncogenic YAP1 fusions is sufficient to inhibit tumor formation in vivo, while \npharmacological inhibition of the YAP1-TEAD interaction inhibits the growth of \nYAP1 fusion-expressing cell lines in vitro. These results highlight \nTEAD-dependent YAP activity found in these gene fusions as critical for \noncogenesis and implicate these YAP functions as potential therapeutic targets \nin YAP1 fusion-positive tumors.",

            "TEXT": "A fine-tuning mechanism underlying self-control for autophagy: deSUMOylation of \nBECN1 by SENP3.\n\nThe roles of SUMOylation and the related enzymes in autophagic regulation are \nunclear. Based on our previous studies that identified the SUMO2/3-specific \npeptidase SENP3 as an oxidative stress-responsive molecule, we investigated the \ncorrelation between SUMOylation and macroautophagy/autophagy. We found that \nSenp3± mice showed increased autophagy in the liver under basal and fasting \nconditions, compared to Senp3+/+ mice. We constructed a liver-specific senp3 \nknockout mouse; these Senp3-deficient liver tissues showed increased autophagy \nas well. Autophagic flux was accelerated in hepatic and other cell lines \nfollowing knockdown of SENP3, both before and after the cells underwent \nstarvation in the form of the serum and amino acid deprivation. We demonstrated \nthat BECN1/beclin 1, the core molecule of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, could be \nSUMO3-conjugated by PIAS3 predominantly at K380 and deSUMOylated by SENP3. The \nbasal SUMOylation of BECN1 was increased upon cellular starvation, which \nenhanced autophagosome formation by facilitating BECN1 interaction with other \ncomplex components UVRAG, PIK3C3 and ATG14, thus promoting PIK3C3 activity. In \ncontrast, SENP3 deSUMOylated BECN1, which impaired BECN1-PIK3C3 complex \nformation or stability to suppress the PIK3C3 activity. DeSUMOylation of BECN1 \nrestrained autophagy induction under basal conditions and especially upon \nstarvation when SENP3 had accumulated in response to the increased generation of \nreactive oxygen species. Thus, while reversible SUMOylation regulated the degree \nof autophagy, SENP3 provided an intrinsic overflow valve for fine-tuning \nautophagy induction.",

            "TEXT": "SYK inhibition targets acute myeloid leukemia stem cells by blocking their \noxidative metabolism.\n\nSpleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is an important oncogene and signaling mediator \nactivated by cell surface receptors crucial for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) \nmaintenance and progression. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of SYK in AML \ncells leads to increased differentiation, reduced proliferation, and cellular \napoptosis. Herein, we addressed the consequences of SYK inhibition to leukemia \nstem-cell (LSC) function and assessed SYK-associated pathways in AML cell \nbiology. Using gain-of-function MEK kinase mutant and constitutively active \nSTAT5A, we demonstrate that R406, the active metabolite of a small-molecule SYK \ninhibitor fostamatinib, induces differentiation and blocks clonogenic potential \nof AML cells through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway and STAT5A transcription factor, \nrespectively. Pharmacological inhibition of SYK with R406 reduced LSC \ncompartment defined as CD34+CD38-CD123+ and CD34+CD38-CD25+ in vitro, and \ndecreased viability of LSCs identified by a low abundance of reactive oxygen \nspecies. Primary leukemic blasts treated ex vivo with R406 exhibited lower \nengraftment potential when xenotransplanted to immunodeficient NSG/J mice. \nMechanistically, these effects are mediated by disturbed mitochondrial \nbiogenesis and suppression of oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) in LSCs. These \nmechanisms appear to be partially dependent on inhibition of STAT5 and its \ntarget gene MYC, a well-defined inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis. In \naddition, inhibition of SYK increases the sensitivity of LSCs to cytarabine \n(AraC), a standard of AML induction therapy. Taken together, our findings \nindicate that SYK fosters OXPHOS and participates in metabolic reprogramming of \nAML LSCs in a mechanism that at least partially involves STAT5, and that SYK \ninhibition targets LSCs in AML. Since active SYK is expressed in a majority of \nAML patients and confers inferior prognosis, the combination of SYK inhibitors \nwith standard chemotherapeutics such as AraC constitutes a new therapeutic \nmodality that should be evaluated in future clinical trials.",

AURKB directly phosphorylates MYC at \nserine 67, counteracting GSK3β-directed threonine 58 phosphorylation and \nsubsequent FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation. Stabilized MYC, in concert \nwith T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (TAL1), directly activates AURKB \ntranscription, constituting a positive feedforward loop that reinforces \nMYC-regulated oncogenic programs. Therefore, inhibitors of AURKB induce \nprominent MYC degradation concomitant with robust leukemia cell death. These \nfindings reveal an AURKB-MYC regulatory circuit that underlies T cell \nleukemogenesis, and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of oncogenic \nMYC via AURKB inhibition.",

Here we show that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C \n(CPT1C), an enzyme that catalyzes carnitinylation of fatty acids for transport \ninto mitochondria for β-oxidation, plays a major role in the regulation of \ncancer cell senescence through mitochondria-associated metabolic reprograming. \nMetabolomics analysis suggested alterations in mitochondria activity, as \nrevealed by the marked decrease in acylcarnitines in senescent human pancreatic \ncarcinoma PANC-1 cells, indicating low CPT1C activity. Direct analyses of mRNA \nand protein show that CPT1C is significantly reduced in senescent cells. \nFurthermore, abnormal mitochondrial function was observed in senescent PANC-1 \ncells, leading to lower cell survival under metabolic stress and suppressed \ntumorigenesis in a mouse xenograft model. Knock-down of CPT1C in PANC-1 cells \ninduced mitochondrial dysfunction, caused senescence-like growth suppression and \ncellular senescence, suppressed cell survival under metabolic stress, and \ninhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Further, CPT1C knock-down suppressed xenograft \ntumor growth in situ. Silencing of CPT1C in five other tumor cell lines also \ncaused cellular senescence. On the contrary, gain-of-function of CPT1C reversed \nPANC-1 cell senescence and enhanced mitochondrial function. This study \nidentifies CPT1C as a novel biomarker and key regulator of cancer cell \nsenescence through mitochondria-associated metabolic reprograming, and suggests \nthat inhibition of CPT1C may represent a new therapeutic strategy for cancer \ntreatment through induction of tumor senescence.",

We previously found \nthat EZH2 regulates RNA polymerase III-transcribed 5S ribosomal RNA gene \ntranscription. However, whether EZH2 regulates ribosome synthesis is still \nunknown. Here, we report that EZH2 promotes ribosome synthesis by targeting and \nsilencing a long noncoding RNA PHACTR2-AS1. PHACTR2-AS1 directly bound ribosome \nDNA genes and recruited histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, which in turn \ntriggered H3K9 methylation of these genes. Depletion of PHACTR2-AS1 resulted in \nhyperactivation of ribosome synthesis and instability of ribosomal DNA, which \npromoted cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Administration of \nPHACTR2-AS1-30nt-RNA, which binds to SUV39H1, effectively inhibited breast \ncancer growth and lung metastasis in mice. PHACTR2-AS1 was downregulated in \nbreast cancer patients, where lower PHACTR2-AS1 expression promoted breast \ncancer development and correlated with poor patient outcome. Taken together, we \ndemonstrate that PHACTR2-AS1 maintains a H3K9 methylation-marked silent state of \nribosomal DNA genes, comprising a regulatory axis that controls breast cancer \ngrowth and metastasis.",

            "TEXT": "Activation of PPARA-mediated autophagy reduces Alzheimer disease-like pathology \nand cognitive decline in a murine model.\n\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. An \nimbalance between the production and clearance of Aβ (amyloid beta) is \nconsidered to be actively involved in AD pathogenesis. Macroautophagy/autophagy \nis a major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins, and \nupregulation of autophagy represents a plausible therapeutic strategy to combat \noverproduction of neurotoxic Aβ. PPARA/PPARα (peroxisome proliferator activated \nreceptor alpha) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in fatty \nacid metabolism and activates hepatic autophagy. We hypothesized that PPARA \nregulates autophagy in the nervous system and PPARA-mediated autophagy affects \nAD. We found that pharmacological activation of PPARA by the PPARA agonists \ngemfibrozil and Wy14643 induces autophagy in human microglia (HM) cells and U251 \nhuman glioma cells stably expressing the human APP (amyloid beta precursor \nprotein) mutant (APP-p.M671L) and this effect is PPARA-dependent. Administration \nof PPARA agonists decreases amyloid pathology and reverses memory deficits and \nanxiety symptoms in APP-PSEN1ΔE9 mice. There is a reduced level of soluble Aβ \nand insoluble Aβ in hippocampus and cortex tissues from APP-PSEN1ΔE9 mice after \ntreatment with either gemfibrozil or Wy14643, which promoted the recruitment of \nmicroglia and astrocytes to the vicinity of Aβ plaques and enhanced \nautophagosome biogenesis. These results indicated that PPARA is an important \nfactor regulating autophagy in the clearance of Aβ and suggested gemfibrozil be \nassessed as a possible treatment for AD.",

They can retain cells in a prolonged mitotic arrest imposing two \nmajor fates, mitotic slippage, or mitotic cell death. While the former is \nmolecularly well characterized, the mechanisms that control mitotic cell death \nremain poorly understood. Here, we performed quantitative proteomics of HeLa \ncells under mitotic arrest induced with paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizer \ndrug, to identify regulators of such cell fate decision. We identified \nalterations in several apoptosis-related proteins, among which the mitochondrial \nfission protein Drp1 presented increased levels. We found that Drp1 depletion \nduring prolonged mitotic arrest led to strong mitochondrial depolarization and \nfaster mitotic cell death as well as enhanced mitophagy, a mechanism to remove \ndamaged mitochondria. Our findings support a new role of Drp1 in orchestrating \nthe cellular stress responses during mitosis, where mitochondrial function and \ndistribution into the daughter cells need to be coordinated with cell fate. This \nnovel function of Drp1 in the cell cycle becomes best visible under conditions \nof prolonged mitotic arrest.",

Here, we report that cancer cells with reduced autophagy-related protein \n12 (ATG12) expression undergo an oncotic cell death, a phenotype distinct from \nthat seen in ATG5-deficient cells described before. In addition, using \nuntargeted metabolomics with ATG12-deficient cancer cells, we observed a global \nreduction in cellular bioenergetic pathways, such as β-oxidation (FAO), \nglycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, as well as a decrease in \nmitochondrial respiration as monitored with Seahorse experiments. Analyzing the \nbiogenesis of mitochondria by quantifying mitochondrial DNA content together \nwith several mitochondrion-localizing proteins indicated a reduction in \nmitochondrial biogenesis in ATG12-deficient cancer cells, which also showed \nreduced hexokinase II expression and the upregulation of uncoupling protein 2. \nATG12, which we observed in normal cells to be partially localized in \nmitochondria, is upregulated in multiple types of solid tumors in comparison \nwith normal tissues. Strikingly, mouse xenografts of ATG12-deficient cells grew \nsignificantly slower as compared with vector control cells. Collectively, our \nwork has revealed a previously unreported role for ATG12 in regulating \nmitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism and points up an \nessential role for mitochondria as a failsafe mechanism in the growth and \nsurvival of glycolysis-dependent cancer cells. Inducing oncosis by imposing an \nATG12 deficiency in solid tumors might represent an anticancer therapy \npreferable to conventional caspase-dependent apoptosis that often leads to \nundesirable consequences, such as incomplete cancer cell killing and a silencing \nof the host immune system.",

However, the \nfunction and underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs in glioma remain unclear. This \nstudy aimed to investigate the role of LINC00998 in glioma progression. Through \nscreening using TCGA database, we found that LINC00998 was downregulated in \nglioblastoma tissues and that low expression of LINC00998 was associated with \npoor prognosis. Overexpression of LINC00998 inhibited glioma cell proliferation \nin vitro and in vivo and blocked the G1/S cell cycle transition, which exerted a \ntumor-suppressive effect on glioma progression. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down \nand mass spectrometry results showed an interaction between LINC00998 and CBX3. \nIP assays demonstrated that LINC00998 could stabilize CBX3 and prevent its \nubiquitination degradation. GSEA indicated that LINC00998 could regulate the \nc-Met/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which was further confirmed by a rescue assay \nusing siRNA-mediated knockdown of CBX3 and the Akt inhibitor MK2206. In \naddition, dual-luciferase assays showed that miR-34c-5p could directly bind to \nLINC00998 and downregulate its expression.

            "TEXT": "Blocking SHH/Patched Interaction Triggers Tumor Growth Inhibition through \nPatched-Induced Apoptosis.\n\nThe Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway plays a key role in cancer. Alterations of SHH \ncanonical signaling, causally linked to tumor progression, have become rational \ntargets for cancer therapy. However, Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors have failed to \nshow clinical benefit in patients with cancers displaying SHH \nautocrine/paracrine expression. We reported earlier that the SHH receptor \nPatched (PTCH) is a dependence receptor that triggers apoptosis in the absence \nof SHH through a pathway that differs from the canonical one, thus generating a \nstate of dependence on SHH for survival. Here, we propose a dual function for \nSHH: its binding to PTCH not only activates the SHH canonical pathway but also \nblocks PTCH-induced apoptosis. Eighty percent, 64%, and 8% of human colon, \npancreatic, and lung cancer cells, respectively, overexpressed SHH at \ntranscriptional and protein levels. In addition, SHH-overexpressing cells \nexpressed all the effectors of the PTCH-induced apoptotic pathway. Although the \ncanonical pathway remained unchanged, autocrine SHH interference in colon, \npancreatic, and lung cell lines triggered cell death through PTCH proapoptotic \nsignaling. In vivo, SHH interference in colon cancer cell lines decreased \nprimary tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the antitumor effect associated \nto SHH deprivation, usually thought to be a consequence of the inactivation of \nthe canonical SHH pathway, is, at least in part, because of the engagement of \nPTCH proapoptotic activity. Together, these data strongly suggest that \ntherapeutic strategies based on the disruption of SHH/PTCH interaction in \nSHH-overexpressing cancers should be explored. SIGNIFICANCE: Sonic \nHedgehog-overexpressing tumors express PTCH-induced cell death effectors, \nsuggesting that this death signaling could be activated as an antitumor \nstrategy.",

            "TEXT": "Isobacachalcone induces autophagy and improves the outcome of immunogenic \nchemotherapy.\n\nA number of natural plant products have a long-standing history in both \ntraditional and modern medical applications. Some secondary metabolites induce \nautophagy and mediate autophagy-dependent healthspan- and lifespan-extending \neffects in suitable mouse models. Here, we identified isobacachalcone (ISO) as a \nnon-toxic inducer of autophagic flux that acts on human and mouse cells in \nvitro, as well as mouse organs in vivo. Mechanistically, ISO inhibits AKT as \nwell as, downstream of AKT, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 \n(mTORC1), coupled to the activation of the pro-autophagic transcription factors \nEB (TFEB) and E3 (TFE3). Cells equipped with a constitutively active AKT mutant \nfailed to activate autophagy. ISO also stimulated the AKT-repressible activation \nof all three arms of the unfolded stress response (UPR), including the \nPERK-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). \nKnockout of TFEB and/or TFE3 blunted the UPR, while knockout of PERK or \nreplacement of eIF2α by a non-phosphorylable mutant reduced TFEB/TFE3 activation \nand autophagy induced by ISO. This points to crosstalk between the UPR and \nautophagy. Of note, the administration of ISO to mice improved the efficacy of \nimmunogenic anticancer chemotherapy. This effect relied on an improved T \nlymphocyte-dependent anticancer immune response and was lost upon constitutive \nAKT activation in, or deletion of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 from, the \nmalignant cells. In conclusion, ISO is a bioavailable autophagy inducer that \nwarrants further preclinical characterization.",

Current efforts are now focused on improving the \ntreatment efficacy of ICB in breast cancer using new combination designs such as \nmolecularly targeted agents, including histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). \nThese epigenetic drugs have been widely described as potent cytotoxic agents for \ncancer cells. In this work, we report new noncanonical regulatory properties of \nultra-selective HDAC6i over the expression and function of \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition pathways and the invasiveness potential of \nbreast cancer. These unexplored roles position HDAC6i as attractive options to \npotentiate ongoing immunotherapeutic approaches. These new functional activities \nof HDAC6i involved regulation of the E-cadherin/STAT3 axis. Pretreatment of \ntumors with HDAC6i induced critical changes in the tumor microenvironment, \nresulting in improved effectiveness of ICB and preventing dissemination of \ncancer cells to secondary niches. Our results demonstrate for the first time \nthat HDAC6i can both improve ICB antitumor immune responses and diminish the \ninvasiveness of breast cancer with minimal cytotoxic effects, thus departing \nfrom the cytotoxicity-centric paradigm previously assigned to HDACi.",

            "TEXT": "Risk SNP-Mediated Enhancer-Promoter Interaction Drives Colorectal Cancer through \nBoth FADS2 and AP002754.2.\n\nAlthough genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 \ncolorectal cancer risk loci, most of the biological mechanisms associated with \nthese loci remain unclear. Here we first performed a comprehensive expression \nquantitative trait loci analysis in colorectal cancer tissues adjusted for \nmultiple confounders to test the determinants of germline variants in \nestablished GWAS susceptibility loci on mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) \nexpression. Combining integrative functional genomic/epigenomic analyses and a \nlarge-scale population study consisting of 6,024 cases and 10,022 controls, we \nthen prioritized rs174575 with a C>G change as a potential causal candidate for \ncolorectal cancer at 11q12.2, as its G allele was associated with an increased \nrisk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.36; P = \n2.57 × 10-9). rs174575 acted as an allele-specific enhancer to distally \nfacilitate expression of both FADS2 and lncRNA AP002754.2 via long-range \nenhancer-promoter interaction loops, which were mediated by E2F1. AP002754.2 \nfurther activated a transcriptional activator that upregulated FADS2 expression. \nFADS2, in turn, was overexpressed in colorectal cancer tumor tissues and \nfunctioned as a potential oncogene that facilitated colorectal cancer cell \nproliferation and xenograft growth in vitro and in vivo by increasing the \nmetabolism of PGE2, an oncogenic molecule involved in colorectal cancer \ntumorigenesis. Our findings represent a novel mechanism by which a noncoding \nvariant can facilitate long-range genome interactions to modulate the expression \nof multiple genes including not only mRNA, but also lncRNA, which provides new \ninsights into the understanding of colorectal cancer etiology. SIGNIFICANCE: \nThis study provides an oncogenic regulatory circuit among several oncogenes \nincluding E2F1, FADS2, and AP002754.2 underlying the association of rs174575 \nwith colorectal cancer risk, which is driven by long-range enhancer-promoter \ninteraction loops.",

            "TEXT": "Hypoxia-induced acetylation of PAK1 enhances autophagy and promotes brain \ntumorigenesis via phosphorylating ATG5.\n\nAlthough the treatment of brain tumors by targeting kinase-regulated \nmacroautophagy/autophagy, is under investigation, the precise mechanism \nunderlying autophagy initiation and its significance in glioblastoma (GBM) \nremains to be defined. Here, we report that PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1) \nis significantly upregulated and promotes GBM development. The Cancer Genome \nAtlas analysis suggests that the oncogenic role of PAK1 in GBM is mainly \nassociated with autophagy. Subsequent experiments demonstrate that PAK1 indeed \nserves as a positive modulator for hypoxia-induced autophagy in GBM. \nMechanistically, hypoxia induces ELP3-mediated PAK1 acetylation at K420, which \nsuppresses the dimerization of PAK1 and enhances its activity, thereby leading \nto subsequent PAK1-mediated ATG5 (autophagy related 5) phosphorylation at the \nT101 residue. This event not only protects ATG5 from ubiquitination-dependent \ndegradation but also increases the affinity between the ATG12-ATG5 complex and \nATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1). Consequently, ELP3-dependent PAK1 (K420) \nacetylation and PAK1-mediated ATG5 (T101) phosphorylation are required for \nhypoxia-induced autophagy and brain tumorigenesis by promoting autophagosome \nformation. Silencing PAK1 with shRNA or small molecule inhibitor FRAX597 \npotentially blocks autophagy and GBM growth. Furthermore, SIRT1-mediated \nPAK1-deacetylation at K420 hinders autophagy and GBM growth. Clinically, the \nlevels of PAK1 (K420) acetylation significantly correlate with the expression of \nATG5 (T101) phosphorylation in GBM patients. Together, this report uncovers that \nthe acetylation modification and kinase activity of PAK1 plays an instrumental \nrole in hypoxia-induced autophagy initiation and maintaining GBM growth. \nTherefore, PAK1 and its regulator in the autophagy pathway might represent \npotential therapeutic targets for GBM treatment.",

Here we report a role for the broadly conserved miR-26 family of \nmicroRNAs (miR-26a-1, miR-26a-2, and miR-26b) as major regulators of APC \ndifferentiation and adipose tissue mass. Deletion of all miR-26-encoding loci in \nmice resulted in a dramatic expansion of adipose tissue in adult animals fed \nnormal chow. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of miR-26a protected mice \nfrom high-fat diet-induced obesity. These effects were attributable to a \ncell-autonomous function of miR-26 as a potent inhibitor of APC differentiation. \nmiR-26 blocks adipogenesis, at least in part, by repressing expression of \nFbxl19, a conserved miR-26 target without a previously known role in adipocyte \nbiology that encodes a component of SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. \nThese findings have therefore revealed a novel pathway that plays a critical \nrole in regulating adipose tissue formation in vivo and suggest new potential \ntherapeutic targets for obesity and related disorders.",

The altered balance between pro- and \nantiapoptosis signals within cancer cells is critical to therapeutic resistance. \nHowever, the molecular mechanisms underlying increased antiapoptosis signals \nremain poorly understood. In this study, we report that PRMT1 expression is \nincreased in pancreatic cancer tissues and is associated with higher tumor \ngrade, increased aggressiveness, and worse prognosis. PRMT1 overexpression \nincreased arginine methylation of HSPs of 70 kDa (HSP70); this methylation \nenhanced HSP70 binding and stabilization of BCL2 mRNA through AU-rich elements \nin 3'-untranslated region and consequentially increased BCL2 protein expression \nand protected cancer cells from apoptosis induced by cellular stresses and \ntherapeutics. RNA binding and regulation function of HSP70 was involved in \npancreatic cancer drug resistance and was dependent on protein arginine \nmethylation. These findings not only reveal a novel PRMT1-HSP70-BCL2 signaling \naxis that is crucial to pancreatic cancer cell survival and therapeutic \nresistance, but they also provide a proof of concept that targeted inhibition of \nthis axis may represent a new therapeutic strategy.",

In this study, we uncover distinct and novel \nfunctions for these kinases in regulating tumor formation and metastatic \ncolonization in various solid tumors, including those of the breast, prostate, \nand pancreas. Combining in vivo CRISPR-based CDK4 and CDK6 gene editing with \npharmacologic inhibition approaches in orthotopic transplantation and \npatient-derived xenograft preclinical models, we defined clear functions for \nCDK4 and CDK6 in facilitating tumor growth and progression in metastatic \ncancers. Transcriptomic profiling of CDK4/6 CRISPR knockouts in breast cancer \nrevealed these two kinases to regulate cancer progression through distinct \nmechanisms. CDK4 regulated prometastatic inflammatory cytokine signaling, \nwhereas CDK6 mainly controlled DNA replication and repair processes. Inhibition \nof CDK6 but not CDK4 resulted in defective DNA repair and increased DNA damage. \nMultiple CDK6 DNA replication/repair genes were not only associated with cancer \nsubtype, grades, and poor clinical outcomes, but also facilitated primary tumor \ngrowth and metastasis in vivo.

Knockdown of HMBOX1 promoted apoptosis and \ninhibited autophagy through regulating intracellular free zinc level in cultured \nVECs. In current study, in order to investigate the roles of HMBOX1 in vivo and \nin endothelium, we generated a knockout (KO) mouse for HMBOX1 by using \ntranscription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) technology. Herein, we \nreported that the protein level of HMBOX1 was gradually increased during mouse \ndevelopment. The HMBOX1 KO mouse was viable and fertile. There existed no \ndifferences in apoptosis and autophagy of aortic endothelial cells between wild \ntype and KO mouse. Whereas, loss of HMBOX1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited \nautophagy of aortic endothelial cells under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation \nin mouse. We also demonstrated that HMBOX1 deletion had no influence on the \nsecretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, overexpression or \nknockdown of HMBOX1 failed to regulate multiple pro-apoptotic genes expression \nin vitro. In conclusion, HMBOX1 participated in the functional maintenance of \nmouse aortic endothelial cells, the aortic endothelial cells of HMBOX1 KO mouse \nshowed increased apoptosis and decreased autophagy with LPS treatment.",

            "TEXT": "Consequences of Zmat3 loss in c-MYC- and mutant KRAS-driven tumorigenesis.\n\nTP53 is a critical tumor suppressor that is mutated in approximately 50% of \nhuman cancers. Unveiling the downstream target genes of TP53 that fulfill its \ntumor suppressor function is an area of intense investigation. Zmat3 (also known \nas Wig-1 or PAG608) is one such downstream target of p53, whose loss in \nhemopoietic stem cells lacking the apoptosis and cell cycle regulators, Puma and \np21, respectively, promotes the development of leukemia. The function of Zmat3 \nin tumorigenesis however remains unclear. Here, to investigate which oncogenic \ndrivers co-operate with Zmat3 loss to promote neoplastic transformation, we \nutilized Zmat3 knockout mice in models of c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis and \nKrasG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma development. Interestingly, unlike loss of \np53, Zmat3 germline loss had little impact on the rate of tumor development or \nseverity of malignant disease upon either the c-MYC or KrasG12D oncogenic \nactivation. Furthermore, loss of Zmat3 failed to rescue KrasG12D primary lung \ntumor cells from oncogene-induced senescence. Taken together, we conclude that \nin the context of c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis or mutant KrasG12D-driven lung \nadenocarcinoma development, additional co-occurring mutations are required to \nresolve Zmat3 tumor suppressive activity.",

However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we \ninvestigated the role of the tumor suppressor Zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 \n(ZHX2) in the progression of NAFLD to HCC. ZHX2 expression was significantly \ndecreased in fatty liver tissues, especially in the liver with NAFLD-HCC. ZHX2 \noverexpression disturbed lipid homeostasis of cultured HCC cells, and inhibited \nlipid deposition in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ZHX2 \ninhibited uptake of exogenous lipids through transcriptional suppression of \nlipid lipase (LPL), leading to retarded proliferation of HCC cells. Importantly, \nLPL overexpression significantly reversed ZHX2-mediated inhibition of HCC cell \nproliferation, xenograft tumor growth, lipid deposition, and spontaneous liver \ntumor formation. Consistently, IHC staining demonstrated a negative correlation \nof ZHX2 with LPL in an HCC cohort. Collectively, ZHX2 protects hepatocytes from \nabnormal lipid deposition in NAFLD through transcriptional repression of LPL, \nwhich subsequently retards cell growth and NAFLD-HCC progression. These findings \nillustrate a novel mechanism of NAFLD progression into HCC.",

Regulation of \nmitochondrial calcium influx from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is considered a \npromising strategy for the prevention of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) accumulation \nthat occurs in the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathogenesis in DM \npatients. Among the metabolites of ellagitannins that are produced in the gut \nmicrobiome, urolithin A has received an increasing amount of attention as a \nnovel candidate with anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects in AD. Here, we \ninvestigated the effect of urolithin A on high glucose-induced amyloidogenesis \ncaused by mitochondrial calcium dysregulation and mtROS accumulation resulting \nin neuronal degeneration. We also identified the mechanism related to \nmitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) formation. We found that urolithin \nA-lowered mitochondrial calcium influx significantly alleviated high \nglucose-induced mtROS accumulation and expression of amyloid beta (Aβ)-producing \nenzymes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase-1 (BACE1), as \nwell as Aβ production. Urolithin A injections in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced \ndiabetic mouse model alleviated APP and BACE1 expressions, Tau phosphorylation, \nAβ deposition, and cognitive impairment. In addition, high glucose stimulated \nMAM formation and transglutaminase type 2 (TGM2) expression. We first discovered \nthat urolithin A significantly reduced high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. In \naddition, disruption of the AIP-AhR complex was involved in urolithin A-mediated \nsuppression of high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. Markedly, TGM2 silencing \ninhibited inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor type \n1 (IP3R1)-voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) \ninteractions and prevented high glucose-induced mitochondrial calcium influx and \nmtROS accumulation. We also found that urolithin A or TGM2 silencing prevented \nAβ-induced mitochondrial calcium influx, mtROS accumulation, Tau \nphosphorylation, and cell death in neuronal cells. In conclusion, we suggest \nthat urolithin A is a promising candidate for the development of therapies to \nprevent DM-associated AD pathogenesis by reducing TGM2-dependent MAM formation \nand maintaining mitochondrial calcium and ROS homeostasis.",

The gene encoding INA, a type IV intermediate filament, was \nfrequently hypermethylated in CpG islands located in the promoter region. This \nhypermethylation preferentially occurred in large tumors and was a prognostic \nmarker for poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. This type \nof epigenetic alteration silenced INA expression in both adenoma and \nadenocarcinoma tissues. Gene silencing of INA in colorectal cancer cells \nincreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Restored INA expression \nblocked migration and invasion in vitro and reduced lung metastasis in vivo. \nMechanistically, INA directly inhibited microtubule polymerization in vitro and \ndecreased intracellular microtubule plus-end assembly rates. A peptide array \nscreen surveying the tubulin-binding sites in INA identified a tubulin-binding \nmotif located in the N-terminal head domain that plays a tumor-suppressive role \nby binding to unpolymerized tubulins and impeding microtubule polymerization. \nThus, epigenetic inactivation of INA is an intermediate filament reorganization \nevent that is essential to accelerate microtubule polymerization in the early \nstages of colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides insight into the \nepigenetic inactivation of INA, a novel identified tumor suppressor, which \nincreases microtubule polymerization during colorectal cancer progression.",

Direct tracing of ChoPLs with \nfluorescence and immunogold labeling imaging revealed the incorporation of newly \nsynthesized ChoPLs into autophagosomal membranes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and \nmitochondria during anticancer drug-induced autophagy. Significant increase in \nthe colocalization of fluorescence signals from the newly synthesized ChoPLs and \nmCherry-MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) was also \nfound on autophagosomes accumulating in cells treated with autophagy-modulating \ncompounds.

            "TEXT": "Accumulation of tissue factor in endothelial cells promotes cellular apoptosis \nthrough over-activation of Src1 and involves β1-integrin signalling.\n\nAccumulation of tissue factor (TF) within cells leads to cellular apoptosis \nmediated through p38 and p53 pathways. In this study, the involvement of Src1 in \nthe induction of TF-mediated cell apoptosis, and the mechanisms of Src1 \nactivation were investigated. Human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) \nwere transfected with plasmids to express the wild-type TF (TFWt-tGFP), or a \nmutant (Ser253 → Ala) which is incapable of being released from cells \n(TFAla253-tGFP). The cells were then activated with PAR2-agonist peptide \n(SLIGKV-NH) and the phosphorylation of Src and Rac, and also the kinase activity \nof Src were assessed. Transfected cells were also pre-incubated with pp60c Src \ninhibitor, FAK inhibitor-14, or a blocking anti-β1-integrin antibody prior to \nactivation and the phosphorylation of p38 as well as cellular apoptosis was \nexamined. Finally, cells were co-transfected with the plasmids, together with a \nSrc1-specific siRNA, activated as above and the cellular apoptosis measured. \nActivation of PAR2 lead to the phosphorylation of Src1 and Rac1 proteins at \n60 min regardless of TF expression. Moreover, Src phosphorylation and kinase \nactivity was prolonged up to 100 min in the presence of TF, with a significantly \nhigher magnitude when the non-releasable TFAla253-tGFP was expressed in HCAEC. \nInhibition of Src with pp60c, or suppression of Src1 expression in cells, \nreduced p38 phosphorylation and prevented cellular apoptosis. In contrast, \ninhibition of FAK had no significant influence on Src kinase activity or \ncellular apoptosis. Finally, pre-incubation of cells with an inhibitory \nanti-β1-integrin antibody reduced both Src1 activation and cellular apoptosis. \nOur data show for the first time that the over-activation of Src1 is a mediator \nof TF-induced cellular apoptosis in endothelial cells through a mechanism that \nis dependent on its interaction with β1-integrin.",

SQSTM1 can \nbe modified by ubiquitination, and this modification modulates its autophagic \nactivity. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning its reversible \ndeubiquitination have never been described. Here we report that USP8 (ubiquitin \nspecific peptidase 8) directly interacted with and deubiquitinated SQSTM1. USP8 \npreferentially removed the lysine 11 (K11)-linked ubiquitin chains from SQSTM1. \nMoreover, USP8 deubiquitinated SQSTM1 principally at K420 within its \nubiquitin-association (UBA) domain. Finally, USP8 inhibited SQSTM1 degradation \nand autophagic influx in cells with wild-type SQSTM1, but not its mutant with \nsubstitution of K420 with an arginine. Taken together, USP8 acts as a negative \nregulator of autophagy by deubiquitinating SQSTM1 at K420.",

Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) \nact as proangiogenic and mitogenic cytokines in multiple myeloma. Here, we \ndemonstrate that the autocrine FGF/FGFR axis is essential for multiple myeloma \ncell survival and progression by protecting multiple myeloma cells from \noxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In keeping with the hypothesis that the \nintracellular redox status can be a target for cancer therapy, FGF/FGFR blockade \nby FGF trapping or tyrosine kinase inhibitor impaired the growth and \ndissemination of multiple myeloma cells by inducing mitochondrial oxidative \nstress, DNA damage, and apoptotic cell death that were prevented by the \nantioxidant vitamin E or mitochondrial catalase overexpression. In addition, \nmitochondrial oxidative stress occurred as a consequence of proteasomal \ndegradation of the c-Myc oncoprotein that led to glutathione depletion. \nAccordingly, expression of a proteasome-nondegradable c-Myc protein mutant was \nsufficient to avoid glutathione depletion and rescue the proapoptotic effects \ndue to FGF blockade. These findings were confirmed on bortezomib-resistant \nmultiple myeloma cells as well as on bone marrow-derived primary multiple \nmyeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory patients, including \nplasma cells bearing the t(4;14) translocation obtained from patients with \nhigh-risk multiple myeloma. Altogether, these findings dissect the mechanism by \nwhich the FGF/FGFR system plays a nonredundant role in multiple myeloma cell \nsurvival and disease progression, and indicate that FGF targeting may represent \na therapeutic approach for patients with multiple myeloma with poor prognosis \nand advanced disease stage.",

The results showed that ATP treatment induced lytic cell \ndeath morphologically resembling canonical pyroptosis in both MCC950-treated \nBMDMs and RAW264.7 cells, but did not cause the activation of caspase-1 (by \ndetecting caspase-1p10 and mature interleukin-1β) and cleavage of GSDMD. \nInstead, both apoptotic initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 \nand -7) caspases were evidently activated and gasdermin E (GSDME) was cleaved to \ngenerate its N-terminal fragment (GSDME-NT) which executes pyroptosis. The \nGSDME-NT production and lytic cell death induced by ATP were diminished by \ncaspase-3 inhibitor. In BMDMs without MCC950 treatment, ATP induced the \nformation of ASC specks which were co-localized with caspase-8; with MCC950 \ntreatment, however, ATP did not induced the formation of ASC specks. In RAW264.7 \ncells, knockdown of GSDME by small interfering RNA attenuated ATP-induced lytic \ncell death and HMGB1 release into culture supernatants. Collectively, our \nresults indicate that ATP induces pyroptosis in macrophages through the \ncaspase-3/GSDME axis when the canonical NLRP3 pathway is blocked, suggestive of \nan alternative mechanism for combating against pathogen evasion.",

            "TEXT": "Dclk1 in tuft cells promotes inflammation-driven epithelial restitution and \nmitigates chronic colitis.\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by \ndefective intestinal barrier integrity toward the microbiota and epithelial \ndamage. Double cortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), a marker of intestinal tuft cells, \ncan regulate tissue regenerative responses, but its role in epithelial repair \nduring bacterial-dependent chronic colitis is unclear. We addressed this \nquestion using our recently developed mouse model of spontaneous \nmicrobiota-dependent colitis induced by mucin-type O-glycan deficiency (DKO), \nwhich recapitulates most features of human UC. We generated DKO mice lacking \nintestinal epithelial Dclk1 (DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC) and analyzed colitis onset and \nseverity using clinical and histologic indices, immune responses by qPCR and \nimmunostaining, and epithelial responses using proliferation markers and \norganoid culture. We found 3-4-week-old DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC mice developed worsened \nspontaneous colitis characterized by reduced body weight, loose stool, severe \ncolon thickening, epithelial lesions, and inflammatory cell infiltrates compared \nwith DKO mice. The primary defect was an impaired epithelial proliferative \nresponse during inflammation. Dclk1 deficiency also reduced inflammation-induced \nproliferation and growth of colon organoids ex vivo. Mechanistically, Dclk1 \nexpression was important for inflammation-induced Cox2 expression and \nprostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in vivo, and PGE2 rescued proliferative \ndefects in Dclk1-deficient colonic organoids. Although tuft cells were expanded \nin both DKO and DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC relative to WT mice, loss of Dclk1 was associated \nwith reduced tuft cell activation (i.e., proliferation) during inflammation. \nSimilar results were found in DKO vs. DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC mice at 3-6 months of age. \nOur results support that tuft cells, via Dclk1, are important responders to \nbacterial-induced colitis by enhancing epithelial repair responses, which in \nturn limits bacterial infiltration into the mucosa.",

            "TEXT": "Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 Promotes pICln-Dependent Androgen Receptor \nTranscription in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\n\nThe majority of advanced prostate cancer therapies aim to inhibit androgen \nreceptor (AR) signaling. However, AR reactivation inevitably drives disease \nprogression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here we demonstrate \nthat protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) functions as an epigenetic \nactivator of AR transcription in CRPC, requiring cooperation with a methylosome \nsubunit pICln. In vitro and in xenograft tumors in mice, targeting PRMT5 or \npICln suppressed growth of CRPC cells. Full-length AR and AR-V7 transcription \nactivation required both PRMT5 and pICln but not MEP50. This activation of \ntranscription was accompanied by PRMT5-mediated symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 \nat the proximal AR promoter. Further, knockdown of PRMT5 abolished the binding \nof pICln (but not vice versa) to the AR proximal promoter region, suggesting \nthat PRMT5 recruits pICln to the AR promoter to activate AR transcription. \nDifferential gene expression analysis in 22Rv1 cells confirmed that PRMT5 and \npICln both regulate the androgen signaling pathway. In addition, PRMT5 and pICln \nprotein expression positively correlated with AR and AR-V7 protein expression in \nCRPC tissues and their expression was highly correlated at the mRNA level across \nmultiple publicly available CRPC datasets. Our results suggest that targeting \nPRMT5 or pICln may be explored as a novel therapy for CRPC treatment by \nsuppressing expression of AR and AR splice variants to circumvent AR \nreactivation.",

To investigate the \nspecific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in \nmonocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine \n(3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and \nadenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells \nand multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, \nGGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these \nprocesses. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly \ndecreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic \ndifferentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level \nof Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic \ndifferentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of \nBeclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the \nlevel of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid \ncell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules \n(CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27kip1). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of \nBecn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone \nactivation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and \noverexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In \naddition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 \nacetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the \nfirst time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy \nprocess during osteoclastogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "Ubiquitination of UVRAG by SMURF1 promotes autophagosome maturation and inhibits \nhepatocellular carcinoma growth.\n\nUVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated) is an important regulator of \nmammalian macroautophagy/autophagy by interacting with BECN1, PIK3C3, and RUBCN. \nPhosphorylation of UVRAG by MTORC1 negatively regulates autophagosome maturation \nunder nutrient-enriched conditions. However, how UVRAG ubiquitination is \nregulated is still unknown. Here we report that UVRAG is ubiquitinated by SMURF1 \nat lysine residues 517 and 559, which decreases the association of UVRAG with \nRUBCN and promotes autophagosome maturation. However, the deubiquitinase ZRANB1 \nspecifically cleaves SMURF1-induced K29 and K33-linked polyubiquitin chains from \nUVRAG, thereby increasing the binding of UVRAG to RUBCN and inhibiting autophagy \nflux. We also demonstrate that CSNK1A1-mediated UVRAG phosphorylation at Ser522 \ndisrupts the binding of SMURF1 to UVRAG through PPxY motif and blocks UVRAG \nubiquitination-mediated autophagosome maturation. Interestingly, ZRANB1 is \nphosphorylated at Thr35, and Ser209 residues by CSNK1A1, and this \nphosphorylation activates its deubiquitinating activity. Importantly, we provide \nin vitro and in vivo evidence that UVRAG ubiquitination at lysine residues 517 \nand 559 or prevention of Ser522 phosphorylation by D4476, a CSNK1A1 inhibitor, \nenhances the lysosomal degradation of EGFR, which significantly inhibits \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth. Furthermore, UVRAG S522 phosphorylation \nlevels correlate with ZRANB1 T35/S209 phosphorylation levels and poor prognosis \nin HCC patients. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism by which \nubiquitination and phosphorylation of UVRAG regulate its function in \nautophagosome maturation and HCC growth, encouraging further study of their \npotential therapeutic implications.",

            "TEXT": "DEPTOR is a direct p53 target that suppresses cell growth and chemosensitivity.\n\nDEP-domain containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), a natural mTOR \ninhibitor, has essential roles in several processes, including cell growth, \nmetabolism, apoptosis, and immunity. DEPTOR expression has been shown to be \ndiversely controlled at transcriptional levels in cell- and context-specific \nmanners. However, whether there is a general mechanism for the regulation of \nDEPTOR expression remains largely unknown. Here, we report that DEPTOR is a \ndownstream target of the tumor suppressor, p53, whose activity is positively \ncorrelated with DEPTOR expression both in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in \nmouse tissues. Mechanistically, p53 directly binds to the DEPTOR promoter and \ntransactivates its expression. Depletion of the p53-binding site on the DEPTOR \npromoter by CRISPR-Cas9 technology decreases DEPTOR expression and promotes cell \nproliferation and survival by activating AKT signaling. Importantly, inhibition \nof AKT by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown abrogates the \ninduction of cell growth and survival induced by deletion of the p53-binding \nregion on the DEPTOR promoter. Furthermore, p53, upon activation by the \ngenotoxic agent doxorubicin, induces DEPTOR expression, leading to cancer cell \nresistance to doxorubicin. Together, DEPTOR is a direct p53 downstream target \nand contributes to p53-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, survival, and \nchemosensitivity.",

Multiple bioinformatic analyses of different human cancer \ndatabases identified key m6A-associated genetic mutations that regulated gastric \ntumorigenesis. YTHDF1 was mutated in about 7% of gastric cancer patients and \nhigh expression of YTHDF1 was associated with more aggressive tumor progression \nand poor overall survival. Inhibition of YTHDF1 attenuated GC cell proliferation \nand tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YTHDF1 promoted the \ntranslation of a key Wnt receptor frizzled7 (FZD7) in an m6A-dependent manner, \nand mutated YTHDF1 enhanced expression of FZD7, leading to hyper-activation of \nthe Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promotion of gastric carcinogenesis. Our results \ndemonstrate the oncogenic role of YTHDF1 and its m6A-mediated regulation of \nWnt/β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer, providing a novel approach of \ntargeting such epigenetic regulators in this disease.",

            "TEXT": "RIP1 kinase activity promotes steatohepatitis through mediating cell death and \ninflammation in macrophages.\n\nHepatocyte cell death and liver inflammation have been well recognized as \ncentral characteristics of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), however, the \nunderlying molecular basis remains elusive. The kinase receptor-interacting \nprotein 1 (RIP1) is a multitasking molecule with distinct functions in \nregulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation. Dissecting the role of RIP1 \ndistinct functions in different pathophysiology has absorbed huge research \nenthusiasm. Wild-type and RIP1 kinase-dead (Rip1K45A/K45A) mice were fed with \nhigh-fat diet (HFD) to investigate the role of RIP1 kinase activity in the \npathogenesis of NASH. Rip1K45A/K45A mice exhibited significantly alleviated NASH \nphenotype of hepatic steatosis, liver damage, fibrosis as well as reduced \nhepatic cell death and inflammation compared to WT mice. Our results also \nindicated that both in vivo lipotoxicity and in vitro saturated fatty acids \n(palmitic acid) treatment were able to induce the kinase activation of RIP1 in \nliver macrophages. RIP1 kinase was required for mediating inflammasome \nactivation, apoptotic and necrotic cell death induced by palmitic acid in both \nbone marrow-derived macrophage and mouse primary Kupffer cells. Results from \nchimeric mice established through lethal irradiation and bone marrow \ntransplantation further confirmed that the RIP1 kinase in hematopoietic-derived \nmacrophages contributed mostly to the disease progression in NASH. Consistent \nwith murine models, we also found that RIP1 kinase was markedly activated in \nhuman NASH, and the kinase activation mainly occurred in liver macrophages as \nindicated by immunofluorescence double staining. In summary, our study indicated \nthat RIP1 kinase was phosphorylated and activated mainly in liver macrophages in \nboth experimental and clinical NASH. We provided direct genetic evidence that \nthe kinase activity of RIP1 especially in hematopoietic-derived macrophages \ncontributes to the pathogenesis of NASH, through mediating inflammasome \nactivation and cell death induction. Macrophage RIP1 kinase represents a \nspecific and potential therapeutic target for NASH.",

            "TEXT": "Kinome screen of ferroptosis reveals a novel role of ATM in regulating iron \nmetabolism.\n\nFerroptosis is a specialized iron-dependent cell death that is associated with \nlethal lipid peroxidation. Modulation of ferroptosis may have therapeutic \npotential since it has been implicated in various human diseases as well as \npotential antitumor activities. However, much remains unknown about the \nunderlying mechanisms and genetic determinants of ferroptosis. Given the \ncritical role of kinases in most biological processes and the availability of \nvarious kinase inhibitors, we sought to systemically identify kinases essential \nfor ferroptosis. We performed a forward genetic-based kinome screen against \nferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells triggered by cystine deprivation. This screen \nidentified 34 essential kinases involved in TNFα and NF-kB signaling. \nUnexpectedly, the DNA damage response serine/threonine kinase ATM (mutated in \nAtaxia-Telangiectasia) was found to be essential for ferroptosis. The \npharmacological or genetic inhibition of ATM consistently rescued multiple \ncancer cells from ferroptosis triggered by cystine deprivation or erastin. \nInstead of the canonical DNA damage pathways, ATM inhibition rescued ferroptosis \nby increasing the expression of iron regulators involved in iron storage \n(ferritin heavy and light chain, FTH1 and FTL) and export (ferroportin, FPN1). \nThe coordinated changes of these iron regulators during ATM inhibition resulted \nin a lowering of labile iron and prevented the iron-dependent ferroptosis. \nFurthermore, we found that ATM inhibition enhanced the nuclear translocation of \nmetal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1), responsible for regulating \nexpression of Ferritin/FPN1 and ferroptosis protection. Genetic depletion of \nMTF-1 abolished the regulation of iron-regulatory elements by ATM and \nresensitized the cells to ferroptosis. Together, we have identified an \nunexpected ATM-MTF1-Ferritin/FPN1 regulatory axis as novel determinants of \nferroptosis through regulating labile iron levels.",

            "TEXT": "CSF1R signaling is a regulator of pathogenesis in progressive MS.\n\nMicroglia serve as the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) \nby providing continuous surveillance of the CNS microenvironment and initiating \ndefense mechanisms to protect CNS tissue. Upon injury, microglia transition into \nan activated state altering their transcriptional profile, transforming their \nmorphology, and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. These activated microglia \ninitially serve a beneficial role, but their continued activation drives \nneuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, \ninflammatory, demyelinating disease of the CNS, and activated microglia and \nmacrophages play a significant role in mediating disease pathophysiology and \nprogression. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and its ligand CSF1 \nare elevated in CNS tissue derived from MS patients. We performed a large-scale \nRNA-sequencing experiment and identified CSF1R as a key node of disease \nprogression in a mouse model of progressive MS. We hypothesized that modulating \nmicroglia and infiltrating macrophages through the inhibition of CSF1R will \nattenuate deleterious CNS inflammation and reduce subsequent demyelination and \nneurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel potent and \nselective small-molecule CSF1R inhibitor (sCSF1Rinh) for preclinical testing. \nsCSF1Rinh blocked receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling in both \nmicroglia and macrophages and altered cellular functions including \nproliferation, survival, and cytokine production. In vivo, CSF1R inhibition with \nsCSF1Rinh attenuated neuroinflammation and reduced microglial proliferation in a \nmurine acute LPS model. Furthermore, the sCSF1Rinh attenuated a \ndisease-associated microglial phenotype and blocked both axonal damage and \nneurological impairments in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) \nmodel of MS. While previous studies have focused on microglial depletion \nfollowing CSF1R inhibition, our data clearly show that signaling downstream of \nthis receptor can be beneficially modulated in the context of CNS injury. \nTogether, these data suggest that CSF1R inhibition can reduce deleterious \nmicroglial proliferation and modulate microglial phenotypes during \nneuroinflammatory pathogenesis, particularly in progressive MS.",

However, as autophagy shares signaling pathways with cell \ndeath and interferes with protein synthesis, prolonged use of autophagy inducers \navailable nowadays is considered unwise. The search for novel autophagy inducers \nindicates that DRD2 (dopamine receptor 2)-DRD3 ligands may also activate \nautophagy, though critical aspects of the action mechanisms and effects of \ndopamine ligands on autophagy are still unknown. In order to shed light on this \nissue, DRD2- and DRD3-overexpressing cells and drd2 KO, drd3 KO and wild-type \nmice were treated with the DRD2-DRD3 agonist pramipexole. The results revealed \nthat pramipexole induces autophagy through MTOR inhibition and a DRD3-dependent \nbut DRD2-independent mechanism. DRD3 activated AMPK followed by inhibitory \nphosphorylation of RPTOR, MTORC1 and RPS6KB1 inhibition and ULK1 activation. \nInterestingly, despite RPS6KB1 inhibition, the activity of RPS6 was maintained \nthrough activation of the MAPK1/3-RPS6KA pathway, and the activity of MTORC1 \nkinase target EIF4EBP1 along with protein synthesis and cell viability, were \nalso preserved. This pattern of autophagy through MTORC1 inhibition without \nsuppression of protein synthesis, contrasts with that of direct allosteric and \ncatalytic MTOR inhibitors and opens up new opportunities for G protein-coupled \nreceptor ligands as autophagy inducers in the treatment of neurodegenerative and \npsychiatric diseases.",

Despite the proven \ntumorigenic role of SLC3A2 in a number of cancers including head and neck \nsquamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the link between SLC3A2, autophagy regulation \nand tumor radioresistance remained elusive. In a recently published study we \ndemonstrated that low levels of SLC3A2 and SLC7A5/LAT1 protein expression \nsignificantly correlate with good clinical prognosis in locally advanced HNSCC \ntreated with primary radiochemotherapy. The SLC3A2-deficient HNSCC cells show a \nhigher radiosensitivity and increased autophagy levels. We found that autophagy \nactivation is a tumor survival strategy to overcome nutrient stress by lack of \nSLC3A2 and to withstand radiation-mediated cell damage. Inhibition of the \nautophagy activation in SLC3A2 knockout HNSCC cells by knockdown of ATG5 \nexpression or treatment with bafilomycin A1 results in radiosensitivity. \nConsequently, the expression levels of ATG5 correlates with overall survival in \nHNSCC patients, and autophagy inhibition in combination with SLC3A2-targeted \ntherapy can be a promising strategy for HNSCC radiosensitization.",

            "TEXT": "BRDT promotes ovarian cancer cell growth.\n\nBromodomain testis-specific factor (BRDT) is a member of the bromodomain and \nextra-terminal (BET) family proteins. Its expression and potential functions in \novarian cancer were examined. We show that BRDT is overexpressed in human \novarian cancer tissues and in established (CaOV3)/primary ovarian cancer cells. \nHowever, its expression is low in ovarian epithelial tissues and cells. \nSignificantly, shRNA-induced silencing or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of BRDT \ninhibited ovarian cancer cell growth, viability, proliferation and migration, \nand induced significant apoptosis activation. Conversely, exogenous \noverexpression of BRDT, by a lentiviral construct, augmented CaOV3 cell \nproliferation and migration. In CaOV3 cells expression of two key BRDT target \ngenes, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and aurora kinase C (AURKC), was downregulated \nby BRDT shRNA or knockout, but upregulated with BRDT overexpression. In vivo, \nxenograft tumors-derived from BRDT-knockout CaOV3 cells grew significantly \nslower than control tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. \nFurthermore, intratumoral injection of BRDT shRNA lentivirus potently inhibited \nthe growth of primary ovarian cancer xenografts in SCID mice. Downregulation of \nPLK1 and AURKC was detected in BRDT-knockout and BRDT-silenced tumor tissues. \nCollectively, BRDT overexpression promotes ovarian cancer cell progression. \nTargeting BRDT could be a novel strategy to treat ovarian cancer.",

            "TEXT": "Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomal microRNA-193a reduces \ncisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer cells via targeting LRRC1.\n\nExosomes are small endogenous membrane vesicles that can mediate cell \ncommunication by transferring genetic materials. Based on that, exosomes have \nalways been discussed as a cargo carrier for microRNA (miRNA) transportation. \nAccumulating data have reported the inhibitory effects of microRNA-193a \n(miR-193a) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell progression. However, the \nmechanisms of miR-193a delivery to cancer cells and miR-193a in exosomes have \nnot been explored clearly in NSCLC. Given that, this work aims to decode \nexosomal miR-193a in cisplatin (DDP) resistance of NSCLC cells. A549 and H1299 \ncell lines were screened out and their parent cells and drug-resistant cells \nwere co-cultured with human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-derived \nexosomes (BMSC-Exo) that had been transfected with miR-193a mimic or si-LRRC1 to \ndetect the colony formation, migration, apoptosis, invasion and proliferation of \nNSCLC cells. In vivo experiment was conducted to verify the in vitro results. \nBMSC-Exo with upregulated miR-193a and downregulated LRRC1 suppressed colony \nformation, invasion, proliferation and migration as well as advanced apoptosis \nof NSCLC parent cells and drug-resistant cells. BMSC-Exo combined with \nupregulated miR-193a reduced tumor volume and weight in mice with NSCLC. \nFunctional studies report that BMSC-Exo shuffle miR-193a to suppress the colony \nformation, invasion, migration, and proliferation as well as advance apoptosis \nof NSCLC DDP-resistant cells via downregulating LRRC1.",

            "TEXT": "NF-κB contributes to Smac mimetic-conferred protection from tunicamycin-induced \napoptosis.\n\nSmac mimetics that deplete cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins have \nbeen shown to activate Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Here, we report that Smac \nmimetic-mediated activation of NF-κB contributes to the rescue of cancer cells \nfrom tunicamycin (TM)-triggered apoptosis. The prototypic Smac mimetic BV6 \nactivates non-canonical and canonical NF-κB pathways, while TM has little effect \non NF-κB signaling. Importantly, ectopic expression of dominant-negative IκBα \nsuperrepressor (IκBα-SR), which inhibits canonical and non-canonical NF-κB \nactivation, significantly reversed this BV6-imposed protection against TM. \nSimilarly, transient or stable knockdown of NF-κB-inducing kinase, which \naccumulated upon exposure to BV6 alone and in combination with TM, significantly \ncounteracted BV6-mediated inhibition of TM-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, \nwhile cIAP2 was initially degraded upon BV6 treatment, it was subsequently \nupregulated in an NF-κB-dependent manner, as this restoration of cIAP2 \nexpression was abolished in IκBα-SR-overexpressing cells. Interestingly, upon \nexposure to TM/BV6 apoptosis was significantly increased in cIAP2 knockdown \ncells. Furthermore, NF-κB inhibition partially prevented BV6-stimulated \nexpression of Mcl-1 upon TM treatment. Consistently, Mcl-1 silencing \nsignificantly inhibited BV6-mediated protection from TM-induced apoptosis. Thus, \nNF-κB activation by Smac mimetic contributes to Smac mimetic-mediated protection \nagainst TM-induced apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "The long noncoding RNA LUCAT1 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation by \nantagonizing Nucleolin to regulate MYC expression.\n\nThe long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LUCAT1 was recently reported to be upregulated \nand to play an essential role in multiple cancer types, especially colorectal \ncancer (CRC), but the molecular mechanisms of LUCAT1 in CRC are mostly \nunreported. Here, a systematic analysis of LUACT1 expression is performed with \ndata from TCGA database and clinic CRC samples. LUCAT1 is identified as a \nputative oncogene, which is significantly upregulated in CRC and is associated \nwith poor prognosis. Loss of LUCAT1 restricts CRC proliferative capacities in \nvitro and in vivo. Mechanically, NCL is identified as the protein binding \npartner of LUCAT1 by using chromatin isolation by RNA purification coupled with \nmass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. We also show \nthat NCL directly binds to LUCAT1 via its putative G-quadruplex-forming regions \nfrom nucleotides 717 to 746. The interaction between LUCAT1 and NCL interferes \nNCL-mediated inhibition of MYC and promote the expression of MYC. Cells lacking \nLUCAT1 show a decreased MYC expression, and NCL knockdown rescue LUCAT1 \ndepletion-induced inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and MYC expression. Our \nresults suggest that LUCAT1 plays a critical role in CRC cell proliferation by \ninhibiting the function of NCL via its G-quadruplex structure and may serve as a \nnew prognostic biomarker and effective therapeutic target for CRC.",

Here we generated \nconstitutive wdr45 knockout (KO) mice that displayed cognitive impairments, \nabnormal synaptic transmission and lesions in several brain regions. \nImmunohistochemistry analysis showed loss of neurons in prefrontal cortex and \nbasal ganglion in aged mice, and increased apoptosis in prefrontal cortex, \nrecapitulating a hallmark of neurodegeneration. Quantitative proteomic analysis \nshowed accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins in KO mouse. At the \ncellular level, accumulation of ER proteins due to WDR45 deficiency resulted in \nincreased ER stress and impaired ER quality control. The unfolded protein \nresponse (UPR) was elevated through ERN1/IRE1 or EIF2AK3/PERK pathway, and \neventually led to neuronal apoptosis. Suppression of ER stress or activation of \nautophagy through MTOR inhibition alleviated cell death. Thus, the loss of WDR45 \ncripples macroautophagy machinery in neurons and leads to impairment in \norganelle autophagy, which provides a mechanistic understanding of cause of BPAN \nand a potential therapeutic strategy to treat this genetic \ndisorder.",

            "TEXT": "Tumor Cell-Derived Angiopoietin-2 Promotes Metastasis in Melanoma.\n\nThe angiopoietin (Angpt)-TIE signaling pathway controls vascular maturation and \nmaintains the quiescent phenotype of resting vasculature. The contextual \nagonistic and antagonistic Tie2 ligand ANGPT2 is believed to be exclusively \nproduced by endothelial cells, disrupting constitutive ANGPT1-TIE2 signaling to \ndestabilize the microvasculature during pathologic disorders like inflammation \nand cancer. However, scattered reports have also portrayed tumor cells as a \nsource of ANGPT2. Employing ISH-based detection of ANGPT2, we found strong tumor \ncell expression of ANGPT2 in a subset of patients with melanoma. Comparative \nanalysis of biopsies revealed a higher fraction of ANGPT2-expressing tumor cells \nin metastatic versus primary sites. Tumor cell-expressed Angpt2 was dispensable \nfor primary tumor growth, yet in-depth analysis of primary tumors revealed \nenhanced intratumoral necrosis upon silencing of tumor cell Angpt2 expression in \nthe absence of significant immune and vascular alterations. Global \ntranscriptional profiling of Angpt2-deficient tumor cells identified \nperturbations in redox homeostasis and an increased response to cellular \noxidative stress. Ultrastructural analyses illustrated a significant increase of \ndysfunctional mitochondria in Angpt2-silenced tumor cells, thereby resulting in \nenhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and downstream MAPK stress \nsignaling. Functionally, enhanced ROS in Angpt2-silenced tumor cells reduced \ncolonization potential in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these findings \nuncover the hitherto unappreciated role of tumor cell-expressed ANGPT2 as an \nautocrine-positive regulator of metastatic colonization and validate ANGPT2 as a \ntherapeutic target for a well-defined subset of patients with melanoma. \nSIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that tumor cells can be a source of ANGPT2 in \nthe tumor microenvironment and that tumor cell-derived ANGPT2 augments \nmetastatic colonization by protecting tumor cells from oxidative stress.",

            "TEXT": "Mitophagy regulates mitochondrial network signaling, oxidative stress, and \napoptosis during myoblast differentiation.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a degradative process essential for various cellular \nprocesses. We previously demonstrated that autophagy-deficiency causes myoblast \napoptosis and impairs myotube formation. In this study, we continued this work \nwith particular emphasis on mitochondrial remodelling and stress/apoptotic \nsignaling. We found increased (p < 0.05) autophagic (e.g., altered LC3B levels, \nincreased ATG7, decreased SQSTM1) and mitophagic (e.g., BNIP3 upregulation, \nmitochondrial localized GFP-LC3 puncta, and elevated mitochondrial LC3B-II) \nsignaling during myoblast differentiation. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7 \n(shAtg7) decreased these autophagic and mitophagic responses, while increasing \nCASP3 activity and ANXA5/annexin V staining in differentiating myoblasts; \nultimately resulting in dramatically impaired myogenesis. Further confirming the \nimportance of mitophagy in these responses, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of \nBnip3 (bnip3-/-) resulted in increased CASP3 activity and DNA fragmentation as \nwell as impaired myoblast differentiation. In addition, shAtg7 myoblasts \ndisplayed greater endoplasmic reticulum (e.g., increased CAPN activity and HSPA) \nand mitochondrial (e.g., mPTP formation, reduced mitochondrial membrane \npotential, elevated mitochondrial 4-HNE) stress. shAtg7 and bnip3-/- myoblasts \nalso displayed altered mitochondria-associated signaling (e.g., PPARGC1A, DNM1L, \nOPA1) and protein content (e.g., SLC25A4, VDAC1, CYCS). Moreover, shAtg7 \nmyoblasts displayed CYCS and AIFM1 release from mitochondria, and CASP9 \nactivation. Similarly, bnip3-/- myoblasts had significantly higher CASP9 \nactivation during differentiation. Importantly, administration of a chemical \ninhibitor of CASP9 (Ac-LEHD-CHO) or dominant-negative CASP9 (ad-DNCASP9) \npartially recovered differentiation and myogenesis in shAtg7 myoblasts. \nTogether, these data demonstrate an essential role for autophagy in protecting \nmyoblasts from mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling during \ndifferentiation, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial network \nremodelling and myogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "NRAS Status Determines Sensitivity to SHP2 Inhibitor Combination Therapies \nTargeting the RAS-MAPK Pathway in Neuroblastoma.\n\nSurvival for high-risk neuroblastoma remains poor and treatment for relapsed \ndisease rarely leads to long-term cures. Large sequencing studies of \nneuroblastoma tumors from diagnosis have not identified common targetable driver \nmutations other than the 10% of tumors that harbor mutations in the anaplastic \nlymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. However, at neuroblastoma recurrence, more frequent \nmutations in genes in the RAS-MAPK pathway have been detected. The \nPTPN11-encoded tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is an activator of the RAS pathway, and \nwe and others have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of SHP2 suppresses the \ngrowth of various tumor types harboring KRAS mutations such as pancreatic and \nlung cancers. Here we report inhibition of growth and downstream RAS-MAPK \nsignaling in neuroblastoma cells in response to treatment with the SHP2 \ninhibitors SHP099, II-B08, and RMC-4550. However, neuroblastoma cell lines \nharboring endogenous NRAS Q61K mutation (which is commonly detected at relapse) \nor isogenic neuroblastoma cells engineered to overexpress NRASQ61K were \ndistinctly resistant to SHP2 inhibitors. Combinations of SHP2 inhibitors with \nother RAS pathway inhibitors such as trametinib, vemurafenib, and ulixertinib \nwere synergistic and reversed resistance to SHP2 inhibition in neuroblastoma in \nvitro and in vivo. These results suggest for the first time that combination \ntherapies targeting SHP2 and other components of the RAS-MAPK pathway may be \neffective against conventional therapy-resistant relapsed neuroblastoma, \nincluding those that have acquired NRAS mutations.",

How cell-autonomous \nregulatory mechanisms modulate the balance among cells committed to \ndifferentiation and those committed to self-renewal to maintain the stem cell \npool remains poorly explored. Here, we show that miR-31 inactivation compromises \nmuscle regeneration in adult mice by impairing the expansion of myoblasts. \nmiR-31 is pivotal for SC proliferation, and its deletion promotes asymmetric \ncell fate segregation of proliferating cells, resulting in enhanced myogenic \ncommitment and re-entry into quiescence. Further analysis revealed that miR-31 \nposttranscriptionally suppresses interleukin 34 (IL34) mRNA, the protein product \nof which activates JAK-STAT3 signaling required for myogenic progression. IL34 \ninhibition rescues the regenerative deficiency of miR-31 knockout mice. Our \nresults provide evidence that targeting miR-31 or IL34 activities in SCs could \nbe used to counteract the functional exhaustion of SCs in pathological \nconditions.",

            "TEXT": "Bcl-2 silencing attenuates hypoxia-induced apoptosis resistance in pulmonary \nmicrovascular endothelial cells.\n\nPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder that \nultimately causes heart failure. While the underlying causes of this condition \nare not well understood, previous studies suggest that the anti-apoptotic nature \nof pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) in hypoxic environments \ncontributes to PAH pathogenesis. In this study, we focus on the contribution of \nBcl-2 and hypoxia response element (HRE) to apoptosis-resistant endothelial \ncells and investigate the mechanism. PMVECs obtained from either normal rats or \napoptosis-resistant PMVECs obtained from PAH rats were transduced with \nrecombinant lentiviral vectors carrying either Bcl-2-shRNA or HRE combined \nBcl-2-shRNA, and then cultured these cells for 24 h under hypoxic (5% O2) or \nnormoxic (21% O2) conditions. In normal PMVECs, Bcl-2-shRNA or HRE combined with \nBcl-2-shRNA transduction successfully decreased Bcl-2 expression, while \nincreasing apoptosis as well as caspase-3 and P53 expression in a normoxic \nenvironment. In a hypoxic environment, the effects of Bcl-2-shRNA treatment on \ncell apoptosis, and on Bcl-2, caspase-3, P53 expression were significantly \nsuppressed. Conversely, HRE activation combined with Bcl-2-shRNA transduction \nmarkedly enhanced cell apoptosis and upregulated caspase-3 and P53 expression, \nwhile decreasing Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, in apoptosis-resistant PMVECs, \nHRE-mediated Bcl-2 silencing effectively enhanced cell apoptosis and caspase-3 \nactivity. The apoptosis rate was significantly depressed when Lv-HRE-Bcl-2-shRNA \nwas combined with Lv-P53-shRNA or Lv-caspase3-shRNA transduction in a hypoxic \nenvironment. These results suggest that HRE-mediated Bcl-2 inhibition can \neffectively attenuate hypoxia-induced apoptosis resistance in PMVECs by \ndownregulating Bcl-2 expression and upregulating caspase-3 and P53 expression. \nThis study therefore reveals critical insight into potential therapeutic targets \nfor treating PAH.",

            "TEXT": "Stem cell niche-specific Ebf3 maintains the bone marrow cavity.\n\nBone marrow is the tissue filling the space between bone surfaces. Hematopoietic \nstem cells (HSCs) are maintained by special microenvironments known as niches \nwithin bone marrow cavities. Mesenchymal cells, termed CXC chemokine ligand 12 \n(CXCL12)-abundant reticular (CAR) cells or leptin receptor-positive (LepR+) \ncells, are a major cellular component of HSC niches that gives rise to \nosteoblasts in bone marrow. However, it remains unclear how osteogenesis is \nprevented in most CAR/LepR+ cells to maintain HSC niches and marrow cavities. \nHere, using lineage tracing, we found that the transcription factor early B-cell \nfactor 3 (Ebf3) is preferentially expressed in CAR/LepR+ cells and that \nEbf3-expressing cells are self-renewing mesenchymal stem cells in adult marrow. \nWhen Ebf3 is deleted in CAR/LepR+ cells, HSC niche function is severely \nimpaired, and bone marrow is osteosclerotic with increased bone in aged mice. In \nmice lacking Ebf1 and Ebf3, CAR/LepR+ cells exhibiting a normal morphology are \nabundantly present, but their niche function is markedly impaired with depleted \nHSCs in infant marrow. Subsequently, the mutants become progressively more \nosteosclerotic, leading to the complete occlusion of marrow cavities in early \nadulthood. CAR/LepR+ cells differentiate into bone-producing cells with reduced \nHSC niche factor expression in the absence of Ebf1/Ebf3 Thus, HSC cellular \nniches express Ebf3 that is required to create HSC niches, to inhibit their \nosteoblast differentiation, and to maintain spaces for HSCs.",

            "TEXT": "The P2RY12 receptor promotes VSMC-derived foam cell formation by inhibiting \nautophagy in advanced atherosclerosis.\n\nVascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are an important source of foam cells in \natherosclerosis. The mechanism for VSMC-derived foam cell formation is, however, \npoorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the P2RY12/P2Y12 receptor is \nimportant in regulating macroautophagy/autophagy and VSMC-derived foam cell \nformation in advanced atherosclerosis. Inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor \nameliorated lipid accumulation and VSMC-derived foam cell formation in high-fat \ndiet-fed apoe-/- mice (atherosclerosis model) independent of LDL-c levels. \nActivation of the P2RY12 receptor blocked cholesterol efflux via PI3K-AKT, while \ngenetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor inhibited \nthis effect in VSMCs. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed that the P2RY12 receptor \nregulated the autophagy pathway in VSMCs. Additionally, activation of the P2RY12 \nreceptor inhibited MAP1LC3/LC3 maturation, SQSTM1 degradation, and autophagosome \nformation in VSMCs. Genetic knockdown of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 \nsignificantly attenuated P2RY12 receptor inhibitor-induced cholesterol efflux in \nVSMCs. Furthermore, activation of the P2RY12 receptor led to the activation of \nMTOR through PI3K-AKT in VSMCs, whereas blocking MTOR activity (rapamycin) or \nreducing MTOR expression reversed the inhibition of cholesterol efflux mediated \nby the P2RY12 receptor in VSMCs. In vivo, inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor \npromoted autophagy of VSMCs through PI3K-AKT-MTOR in advanced atherosclerosis in \napoe-/- mice, which could be impeded by an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine). \nTherefore, we conclude that activation of the P2RY12 receptor decreases \ncholesterol efflux and promotes VSMC-derived foam cell formation by blocking \nautophagy in advanced atherosclerosis. Our study thus suggests that the P2RY12 \nreceptor is a therapeutic target for treating atherosclerosis.",

Elevated expression of human telomerase reverse \ntranscriptase (TERT) is an important hallmark in cancers, but the mechanism by \nwhich TERT is activated differentially in cancers is poorly understood. Here, we \nhave identified nuclear receptor coactivator-3 (NCOA3) as a new modulator of \nTERT expression and tumor growth in HCC. NACO3 specifically binds to the TERT \npromoter at the -234 to -144 region and transcriptionally activates TERT \nexpression. NCOA3 promotes HCC cell growth and tumor progression in vitro and in \nvivo through upregulating the TERT signaling. Knockdown of NACO3 suppresses HCC \ncell viability and colony formation, whereas TERT overexpression rescues this \nsuppression. NCOA3 interacts with and recruits SP1 binding on the TERT promoter. \nKnockdown of NCOA3 also inhibits the expression of the Wnt signaling-related \ngenes but has no effect on the Notch signaling-targeting genes. Moreover, NCOA3 \nis positively correlated with TERT expression in HCC tumor tissues, and high \nexpression of both NCOA3 and TERT predicts a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Our \nfindings indicate that targeting the NCOA3-SP1-TERT signaling axis may benefit \nHCC patients.",

We specifically examined the role of Afadin as a potential \nClaudin-2-interacting partner that promotes breast cancer liver metastasis. \nAfadin associates with Claudin-2, an interaction that requires the PDZ-binding \nmotif of Claudin-2. Loss of Afadin also impairs the ability of breast cancer \ncells to form colonies in soft agar and metastasize to the lungs or liver. \nImmunohistochemical analysis of Claudin-2 and/or Afadin expression in 206 \nmetastatic breast cancer tumors revealed that high levels of both Claudin-2 and \nAfadin in primary tumors were associated with poor disease-specific survival, \nrelapse-free survival, lung-specific relapse, and liver-specific relapse.

            "TEXT": "Inhibition of SIRT1/2 upregulates HSPA5 acetylation and induces pro-survival \nautophagy via ATF4-DDIT4-mTORC1 axis in human lung cancer cells.\n\nSirtuins have emerged as a promising novel class of anti-cancer drug targets. \nInhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 induces apoptosis in cancer cells and they play \nmultifaceted roles in regulating autophagy. In the present study, we found that \nsalermide, a SIRT1/2-specific inhibitor or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to \nblock SIRT1/2 expression could induce autophagy in human NSCLC cells. Moreover, \nSIRT1/2 inhibition increased the expression levels of ATF4 and DDIT4 and \ndownregulated p-RPS6KB1 and p-EIF4EBP1, two downstream molecules of mTORC1. \nMoreover, ATF4 or DDIT4 knockdown attenuated salermide-induced autophagy, \nsuggesting that SIRT1/2 inhibition induced autophagy through the \nATF4-DDIT4-mTORC1 axis. Mechanistically, SIRT1/2 inhibition led to HSPA5 \nacetylation and dissociation from EIF2AK3, leading to ER stress response and \nfollowed by upregulation of ATF4 and DDIT4, triggering autophagy. Silencing of \nthe autophagic gene ATG5 in lung cancer cells resulted in increased apoptotic \ncell death induced by SIRT1/2 inhibition. Our data show that inhibition of \nSIRT1/2 induces pro-survival autophagy via acetylation of HSPA5 and subsequent \nactivation of ATF4 and DDIT4 to inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway in NSCLC \ncells. These findings suggest that combinatorial treatment with SIRT1/2 \ninhibitors and pharmacological autophagy inhibitors is an effective therapeutic \nstrategy for cancer therapy.",

Alternative means to treat melanoma, in particular through the \ninduction of programmed cell death modalities such as apoptosis or necroptosis, \ntherefore still need to be explored. Here, we report that melanoma cell lines \nexpressing notable amounts of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL, the key players of \nnecroptosis signal transduction, fail to execute necroptotic cell death. \nInterestingly, the activity of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 \n(TAK1) appears to prevent RIPK1 from contributing to cell death induction, since \nTAK1 inhibition by (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol, deletion of MAP3K7 or the expression of \ninactive TAK1 were sufficient to sensitize melanoma cells to RIPK1-dependent \ncell death in response to TNFα or TRAIL based combination treatments. However, \ncell death was executed exclusively by apoptosis, even when RIPK3 expression was \nhigh. In addition, TAK1 inhibitor (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol suppressed intrinsic or \ntreatment-induced pro-survival signaling as well as the secretion of cytokines \nand soluble factors associated with melanoma disease progression. \nCorrespondingly, elevated expression of TAK1 correlates with reduced disease \nfree survival in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma. Overall, our results \ntherefore demonstrate that TAK1 suppresses the susceptibility to RIPK1-dependent \ncell death and that high expression of TAK1 indicates an increased risk for \ndisease progression in melanoma.",

Our data \ndemonstrate that LMP occurs in neurons following controlled cortical impact \ninduced (CCI) traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice, leading to impaired \nmacroautophagy (autophagy) and neuronal cell death. Comparison of LC-MS/MS \nlysosomal membrane lipid profiles from TBI and sham animals suggested a role for \nPLA2G4A/cPLA2 (phospholipase A2, group IVA [cytosolic, calcium-dependent]) in \nTBI-induced LMP. Activation of PLA2G4A caused LMP and inhibition of autophagy \nflux in cell lines and primary neurons. In vivo pharmacological inhibition of \nPLA2G4A attenuated TBI-induced LMP, as well as subsequent impairment of \nautophagy and neuronal loss, and was associated with improved neurological \noutcomes. Inhibition of PLA2G4A in vitro limited amyloid-β-induced LMP and \ninhibition of autophagy. Together, our data indicate that PLA2G4A -mediated \nlysosomal membrane damage is involved in neuronal cell death following \nCCI-induced TBI and potentially in other neurodegenerative \ndisorders.",

Here, we show a \nnon-canonical oxidative-stress defense mechanism through TRPA1, a neuronal \nredox-sensing Ca2+-influx channel. In TRPA1-enriched breast and lung cancer \nspheroids, TRPA1 is critical for survival of inner cells that exhibit ROS \naccumulation. Moreover, TRPA1 promotes resistance to ROS-producing \nchemotherapies, and TRPA1 inhibition suppresses xenograft tumor growth and \nenhances chemosensitivity. TRPA1 does not affect redox status but upregulates \nCa2+-dependent anti-apoptotic pathways. NRF2, an oxidant-defense transcription \nfactor, directly controls TRPA1 expression, thus providing an orthogonal \nmechanism for protection against oxidative stress together with canonical \nROS-neutralizing mechanisms. These findings reveal an oxidative-stress defense \nprogram involving TRPA1 that could be exploited for targeted cancer therapies.",

Cellular senescence, another means of responding to \nlong-term cellular stress, has also been linked to myofibroblast differentiation \nand fibrosis. Here, we evaluate the relationship between senescence and \nmyofibroblast differentiation in the context of sustained autophagy. We analyzed \nmarkers of cell cycle arrest/senescence in fibroblasts in vitro, where autophagy \nwas triggered by serum starvation (SS). Autophagic fibroblasts expressed the \nsenescence biomarkers CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 and exhibited increased \nsenescence-associated GLB1/beta-galactosidase activity. Inhibition of autophagy \nin serum-starved fibroblasts with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, or ATG7 (autophagy \nrelated 7) silencing prevented the expression of senescence-associated markers. \nSimilarly, suppressing MTORC2 activation using rapamycin or by silencing RICTOR \nalso prevented senescence hallmarks. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that \nsenescence and myofibroblast differentiation were induced in different cells, \nsuggesting mutually exclusive activation of senescence and myofibroblast \ndifferentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known inducers of senescence \nand exposing fibroblasts to ROS scavengers decreased ROS production during SS, \ninhibited autophagy, and significantly reduced the expression of senescence and \nmyofibroblast differentiation markers. ROS scavengers also curbed the AKT1 \nphosphorylation at Ser473, an MTORC2 target, establishing the importance of ROS \nin fueling MTORC2 activation. Inhibition of senescence by shRNA to TP53/p53 and \nshRNA CDKN2A/p16 increased myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a negative \nfeedback loop of senescence on autophagy-induced myofibroblast differentiation. \nCollectively, our results identify ROS as central inducers of MTORC2 activation \nduring chronic autophagy, which in turn fuels senescence activation and \nmyofibroblast differentiation in distinct cellular subpopulations.",

            "TEXT": "Fibroblast-Derived IL33 Facilitates Breast Cancer Metastasis by Modifying the \nImmune Microenvironment and Driving Type 2 Immunity.\n\nLungs are one of the main sites of breast cancer metastasis. The metastatic \nmicroenvironment is essential to facilitate growth of disseminated tumor cells. \nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are prominent players in the \nmicroenvironment of breast cancer. However, their role in the formation of a \npermissive metastatic niche is unresolved. Here we show that IL33 is upregulated \nin metastases-associated fibroblasts in mouse models of spontaneous breast \ncancer metastasis and in patients with breast cancer with lung metastasis. \nUpregulation of IL33 instigated type 2 inflammation in the metastatic \nmicroenvironment and mediated recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and \ninflammatory monocytes to lung metastases. Importantly, targeting of IL33 in \nvivo resulted in inhibition of lung metastasis and significant attenuation of \nimmune cell recruitment and type 2 immunity. These findings demonstrate a key \nfunction of IL33 in facilitating lung metastatic relapse by modulating the \nimmune microenvironment. Our study shows a novel interaction axis between CAF \nand immune cells and reveals the central role of CAF in establishing a \nhospitable inflammatory niche in lung metastasis.",

RAB25 blocks chemotherapy-induced \napoptosis upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by either \nincreasing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins or decreasing proapoptotic BCL-2 \nproteins.

            "TEXT": "NOX4 Inhibition Potentiates Immunotherapy by Overcoming Cancer-Associated \nFibroblast-Mediated CD8 T-cell Exclusion from Tumors.\n\nDetermining mechanisms of resistance to αPD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint \nimmunotherapy is key to developing new treatment strategies. Cancer-associated \nfibroblasts (CAF) have many tumor-promoting functions and promote immune evasion \nthrough multiple mechanisms, but as yet, no CAF-specific inhibitors are \nclinically available. Here we generated CAF-rich murine tumor models (TC1, MC38, \nand 4T1) to investigate how CAFs influence the immune microenvironment and \naffect response to different immunotherapy modalities [anticancer vaccination, \nTC1 (HPV E7 DNA vaccine), αPD-1, and MC38] and found that CAFs broadly \nsuppressed response by specifically excluding CD8+ T cells from tumors (not CD4+ \nT cells or macrophages); CD8+ T-cell exclusion was similarly present in CAF-rich \nhuman tumors. RNA sequencing of CD8+ T cells from CAF-rich murine tumors and \nimmunochemistry analysis of human tumors identified significant upregulation of \nCTLA-4 in the absence of other exhaustion markers; inhibiting CTLA-4 with a \nnondepleting antibody overcame the CD8+ T-cell exclusion effect without \naffecting Tregs. We then examined the potential for CAF targeting, focusing on \nthe ROS-producing enzyme NOX4, which is upregulated by CAF in many human \ncancers, and compared this with TGFβ1 inhibition, a key regulator of the CAF \nphenotype. siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition [GKT137831 (Setanaxib)] \nof NOX4 \"normalized\" CAF to a quiescent phenotype and promoted intratumoral CD8+ \nT-cell infiltration, overcoming the exclusion effect; TGFβ1 inhibition could \nprevent, but not reverse, CAF differentiation. Finally, NOX4 inhibition restored \nimmunotherapy response in CAF-rich tumors. These findings demonstrate that \nCAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance can be effectively overcome through NOX4 \ninhibition and could improve outcome in a broad range of cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: \nNOX4 is critical for maintaining the immune-suppressive CAF phenotype in tumors. \nPharmacologic inhibition of NOX4 potentiates immunotherapy by overcoming \nCAF-mediated CD8+ T-cell exclusion.",

            "TEXT": "PRKN-regulated mitophagy and cellular senescence during COPD pathogenesis.\n\nCigarette smoke (CS)-induced accumulation of mitochondrial damage has been \nwidely implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. \nMitophagy plays a crucial role in eliminating damaged mitochondria, and is \ngoverned by the PINK1 (PTEN induced putative protein kinase 1)-PRKN (parkin RBR \nE3 ubiquitin protein ligase) pathway. Although both increased PINK1 and reduced \nPRKN have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis in association with mitophagy, \nthere are conflicting reports for the role of mitophagy in COPD progression. To \nclarify the involvement of PRKN-regulated mitophagy in COPD pathogenesis, prkn \nknockout (KO) mouse models were used. To illuminate how PINK1 and PRKN regulate \nmitophagy in relation to CS-induced mitochondrial damage and cellular \nsenescence, overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in airway \nepithelial cells (AEC). In comparison to wild-type mice, prkn KO mice \ndemonstrated enhanced airway wall thickening with emphysematous changes \nfollowing CS exposure. AEC in CS-exposed prkn KO mice showed accumulation of \ndamaged mitochondria and increased oxidative modifications accompanied by \naccelerated cellular senescence. In vitro experiments showed PRKN overexpression \nwas sufficient to induce mitophagy during CSE exposure even in the setting of \nreduced PINK1 protein levels, resulting in attenuation of mitochondrial ROS \nproduction and cellular senescence. Conversely PINK1 overexpression failed to \nrecover impaired mitophagy caused by PRKN knockdown, indicating that PRKN \nprotein levels can be the rate-limiting factor in PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy \nduring CSE exposure. These results suggest that PRKN levels may play a pivotal \nrole in COPD pathogenesis by regulating mitophagy, suggesting that PRKN \ninduction could mitigate the progression of COPD.",

Autophagy is a protective process involving self-cannibalization \nto maintain cellular energy homeostasis during nutrient deprivation. We \ndeveloped a mouse model for Lkb1-deficient lung cancer with conditional deletion \nof essential autophagy gene Atg7 to test whether autophagy compensates for LKB1 \nloss for tumor cells to survive energy crises. We found that autophagy ablation \nwas synthetically lethal during Lkb1-deficient lung tumorigenesis in both tumor \ninitiation and tumor growth. We further found that autophagy deficiency causes \ndefective intracellular recycling, which limits amino acids to support \nmitochondrial energy production in starved cancer cells and causes \nautophagy-deficient cells to be more dependent on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for \nenergy production, leading to reduced lipid reserve and energy crisis. Our \nfindings strongly suggest that autophagy inhibition could be a strategy for \ntreating LKB1-deficient lung tumors.",

Here we report that the \ninhibition of mutated EGFR promotes the secretion of a potent vasoconstrictor, \nendothelin-1 (EDN1), which continues to increase as the cells become resistant \nwith a mesenchymal phenotype. As EDN1 and its receptor (EDNR) is linked to \ncancer progression, EDNR-antagonists have been evaluated in several clinical \ntrials with disappointing results. These trials were based on a hypothesis that \nthe EDN1-EDNR axis activates the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway that is vital to the \ncancer cell survival; the trials were not designed to evaluate the impact of \ntumor-derived EDN1 in modifying tumor microenvironment or contributing to drug \nresistance. Ectopic overexpression of EDN1 in cells with mutated EGFR resulted \nin poor drug delivery and retarded growth in vivo but not in vitro. Intratumoral \ninjection of recombinant EDN significantly reduced blood flow and subsequent \ngefitinib accumulation in xenografted EGFR-mutant tumors. Furthermore, depletion \nof EDN1 or the use of endothelin receptor inhibitors bosentan and ambrisentan \nimproved drug penetration into tumors and restored blood flow in \ntumor-associated vasculature.

Although the CQ-CDDP combination decreased \nprotein expression of ATM and ATR, phosphorylation of ATM was increased and \nexpression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was also increased in CQ-CDDP-treated cells. \nKnockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1 by shRNA reduced the expression of γH2AX and \nphosphorylated ATM and inhibited caspase-3 activity but induced ATM protein \nexpression. Knockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1 partly inhibited CQ-CDDP-induced G2/M \narrest, demonstrating that knockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1 overcame the cytotoxic \neffect of the CQ-CDDP combination. Ectopic expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 in \nCDDP-treated ATG5-shRNA/A2780-CP20 cells increased expression of γH2AX and \ncaspase-3 activity, demonstrating increased DNA damage and cell death. The \ninhibition of autophagy by ATG5-shRNA demonstrated similar results upon CDDP \ntreatment, except p21WAF1/CIP1 expression. In an in vivo efficacy study, the \nCQ-CDDP combination significantly decreased tumor weight and increased \nexpression of γH2AX and p21WAF1/CIP1 in A2780-CP20 orthotopic xenografts and a \ndrug-resistant patient-derived xenograft model of EOC compared with controls. \nThese results demonstrated that CQ increases cytotoxicity in combination with \nCDDP by inducing lethal DNA damage by induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and \nautophagy inhibition in CDDP-resistant EOC.",

            "TEXT": "Vitamin D improves sunburns by increasing autophagy in M2 macrophages.\n\nCutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, \ncellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that \nexacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory \nM2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. \nVitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to \ninjury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we \ninvestigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated \nsunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we \ndemonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained \ninhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in \nmyeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression \ncorroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron \nmicroscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following \nvitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy \nincreased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented \nvitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective \ndeletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin \nD-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. \nMechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, \nPparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a \nsimilar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, \nidentifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of \nskin from UV damage.",

            "TEXT": "Hemocompatible LAT1-inhibitor can induce apoptosis in cancer cells without \naffecting brain amino acid homeostasis.\n\nIncreased amounts of amino acids are essential for cancer cells to support their \nsustained growth and survival. Therefore, inhibitors of amino acid transporters, \nsuch as L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) have been developed. In this \nstudy, a previously reported LAT1-inhibitor (KMH-233) was studied for its \nhemocompatibility and toxicity towards human umbilical vein endothelial cells \n(HUVEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs). Furthermore, the \ncytotoxic effects against human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and its \nability to affect mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) and \nnuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling \nwere evaluated. Moreover, the effects of this inhibitor to modulate LAT1 \nfunction on the cell surface and the brain amino acid homeostasis were evaluated \nafter intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LAT1-inhibitor (23 µmol/kg) in \nmice. The results showed that LAT1-inhibitor (KMH-233) is hemocompatible at \nconcentrations below 25 µM and it does not affect coagulation in plasma. \nHowever, it can reduce the total protein amount of mTOR and NF-κB, resulting in \nincreased apoptosis in LAT1-expressing cancer cells. Most importantly, the \ninhibitor did not affect mouse brain levels of L-Leu, L-Tyr or L-Trp or modulate \nthe function of LAT1 on the MCF-7 cell surface. Therefore, this inhibitor can be \nconsidered as a safe but effective anti-cancer agent. However, due to the \ncompensative mechanism of cancer cells for their increased amino acid demand, \nthis compound is most effective inducing apoptosis when used in combinations \nwith other chemotherapeutics, such as protease inhibitor, bestatin, as \ndemonstrated in this study.",

However, little is known about the cell \ntype-specific effects of YAP/TAZ on the development of pancreatic cancer. Here \nwe clarify the unique consequences of YAP/TAZ activation in the ductal cell \npopulation of the pancreas by generating mice with pancreatic duct \ncell-specific, inducible knockouts of Lats1 and Lats2, the main kinases upstream \nof YAP/TAZ. Oncogenic activation of YAP by deletion of Lats1/2 in ductal cells \nled to the rapid transformation of the pancreas, which was accompanied by a \nrobust increase in the expression of YAP and AP-1 target genes. Pharmacologic \ninhibition of AP-1 activity induced death in Lats1/2 knockout organoids and \nattenuated YAP-dependent transformation of the pancreas in vivo. Both YAP and \nAP-1 were activated during the development of KRAS-dependent cancer in mice and \nhuman patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this \nsignaling hub represents an important mediator of pancreatic cancer development \nand progression. Collectively, these data define a YAP-dependent mechanism of \npancreatic cancer cell development and suggest that inhibition of AP-1 can \nsuppress this development.",

However, the \nmechanisms that regulate autophagy and metabolic reprogramming during reactive \noxygen species (ROS) generation, and how ROS promote tumorigenesis, still need \nto be fully understood. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) λ/ι loss in \nhepatocytes promotes autophagy and oxidative phosphorylation. This results in \nROS generation, which through NRF2 drives HCC through cell-autonomous and \nnon-autonomous mechanisms. Although PKCλ/ι promotes tumorigenesis in \noncogene-driven cancer models, emerging evidence demonstrate that it is a tumor \nsuppressor in more complex carcinogenic processes.

            "TEXT": "CASP9 (caspase 9) is essential for autophagosome maturation through regulation \nof mitochondrial homeostasis.\n\nCASP9 (caspase 9) is a well-known initiator caspase which triggers intrinsic \napoptosis. Recent studies also suggest various non-apoptotic roles of CASP9, \nincluding macroautophagy/autophagy regulation. However, the involvement of CASP9 \nin autophagy and its molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we \nreport the non-apoptotic function of CASP9 in positive regulation of autophagy \nthrough maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Growth factor or amino acid \ndeprivation-induced autophagy activated CASP9, but without apoptotic features. \nPharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of CASP9 decreased autophagy \nflux, while ectopic expression of CASP9 rescued autophagy defects. In CASP9 \nknockout (KO) cells, initiation and elongation of phagophore membranes were \nnormal, but sealing of the membranes and autophagosome maturation were impaired, \nand the lifetime of autophagosomes was prolonged. Ablation of CASP9 caused an \naccumulation of inactive ATG3 and decreased lipidation of the Atg8-family \nmembers, most severely that of GABARAPL1. Moreover, it resulted in abnormal \nmitochondrial morphology with depolarization of the membrane potential, reduced \nreactive oxygen species production, and aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial \nfusion-fission proteins. CASP9 expression or exogenously added H2O2 in the CASP9 \nKO cells corrected the ATG3 level and lipidation status of Atg8-family members, \nand restored autophagy flux. Of note, only CASP9 expression but not H2O2 rescued \nmitochondrial defects, revealing regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by \nCASP9. Our findings suggest a new regulatory link between mitochondria and \nautophagy through CASP9 activity, especially for the proper operation of the \nAtg8-family conjugation system and autophagosome closure and maturation.",

            "TEXT": "GDF11 inhibits cardiomyocyte pyroptosis and exerts cardioprotection in acute \nmyocardial infarction mice by upregulation of transcription factor HOXA3.\n\nNLRP3 (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin \ndomain-containing 3) inflammasome-mediated cardiomyocytes pyroptosis plays a \ncrucial part in progression of acute myocardial infarction (MI). GDF11 (Growth \nDifferentiation Factor 11) has been reported to generate cytoprotective effects \nin phylogenesis and multiple diseases, but the mechanism that GDF11 contributes \nto cardioprotection of MI and cardiomyocytes pyroptosis remains poorly \nunderstood. In our study, we first determined that GDF11 was abnormally \ndownregulated in the heart tissue of MI mice and hypoxic cardiomyocytes. \nMoreover, AAV9-GDF11 markedly alleviated heart function in MI mice. Meanwhile, \nGDF11 overexpression also decreased the pyroptosis of hypoxic cardiomyocytes. \nPROMO and JASPAR prediction software found that transcription factor HOXA3 was \npredicted as an important regulator of NLRP3, and was confirmed by ChIP assay. \nFurther analysis identifying GDF11 promoted the Smad2/3 pathway resulted in \nHOXA3 overexpression. Taken together, our study implies that GDF11 prevents \ncardiomyocytes pyroptosis via HOXA3/NLRP3 signaling pathway in MI mice.",

The underlying mechanisms remain to be \ndetermined. Here, we found that mTOR signaling was activated in fibroblasts from \nmouse kidneys with ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). Ablation of fibroblast \nRheb or Rictor promoted, while ablation of fibroblast Tsc1 protected against \ntubular cell death and IRI in mice. In tubular cells cultured with conditioned \nmedia (CM) from Rheb-/- or Rictor-/- fibroblasts, less hepatocyte growth factor \n(HGF) receptor c-met signaling activation or staurosporine-induced cell \napoptosis was observed. While CM from Tsc1-/- fibroblasts promoted tubular cell \nc-met signaling activation and inhibited staurosporine-induced cell apoptosis. \nIn kidney fibroblasts, blocking mTOR signaling downregulated the expression of \nperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and HGF. Downregulating \nfibroblast HGF expression or blocking tubular cell c-met signaling facilitated \ntubular cell apoptosis. Notably, renal PPARγ and HGF expression was less in mice \nwith fibroblast Rheb or Rictor ablation, but more in mice with fibroblast Tsc1 \nablation than their littermate controls, respectively. Together, these data \nsuggest that mTOR signaling activation in kidney fibroblasts protects against \ntubular cell death and dictates the outcome of AKI through stimulating PPARγ and \nHGF expression.",

            "TEXT": "miR-322/-503 rescues myoblast defects in myotonic dystrophy type 1 cell model by \ntargeting CUG repeats.\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common type of adult muscular \ndystrophy caused by the expanded triple-nucleotides (CUG) repeats. Myoblast in \nDM1 displayed many defects, including defective myoblast differentiation, \nribonuclear foci, and aberrant alternative splicing. Despite many were revealed \nto function in DM1, microRNAs that regulated DM1 via directly targeting the \nexpanded CUG repeats were rarely reported. Here we discovered that miR-322/-503 \nrescued myoblast defects in DM1 cell model by targeting the expanded CUG \nrepeats. First, we studied the function of miR-322/-503 in normal C2C12 myoblast \ncells. Downregulation of miR-322/-503 significantly hindered the myoblast \ndifferentiation, while miR-322/-503 overexpression promoted the process. Next, \nwe examined the role of miR-322/-503 in the DM1 C2C12 cell model. miR-322/-503 \nwas downregulated in the differentiation of DM1 C2C12 cells. When we introduced \nectopic miR-322/-503 expression into DM1 C2C12 cells, myoblast defects were \nalmost fully rescued, marked by significant improvements of myoblast \ndifferentiation and repressions of ribonuclear foci formation and aberrant \nalternative splicing. Then we investigated the downstream mechanism of \nmiR-322/-503 in DM1. Agreeing with our previous work, Celf1 was proven to be \nmiR-322/-503's target. Celf1 knockdown partially reproduced miR-322/-503's \nfunction in rescuing DM1 C2C12 differentiation but was unable to repress \nribonuclear foci, suggesting other targets of miR-322/-503 existed in the DM1 \nC2C12 cells. As the seed regions of miR-322 and miR-503 were complementary to \nthe CUG repeats, we hypothesized that the CUG repeats were the target of \nmiR-322/-503. Through expression tests, reporter assays, and colocalization \nstaining, miR-322/-503 was proved to directly and specifically target the \nexpanded CUG repeats in the DM1 cell model rather than the shorter ones in \nnormal cells. Those results implied a potential therapeutic function of \nmiR-322/-503 on DM1, which needed further investigations in the future.",

MYC suppressed MXI1 \nexpression via microRNA-155 (miR-155) and the microRNA-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster \n(miR-23a cluster), whereas MXI1, in turn, inhibited MYC expression by binding to \nits promoter. Overexpression of miR-155 and the miR-23a cluster promoted \ntumorigenesis in U87 glioma cells. Furthermore, fat mass and obesity-associated \nprotein (FTO), an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA demethylase, regulated the loop \nby targeting MYC. The ethyl ester form of meclofenamic acid (MA2) inhibited FTO \nand enhanced the effect of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide on suppressing \nproliferation of glioma cells and negatively regulated the loop. These data \ncollectively highlight a key regulatory circuit in glioma and provide potential \ntargets for clinical treatment.",

We report here that ZNF704, a gene mapped to 8q21, is \nrecurrently amplified in various malignancies including breast cancer. ZNF704 \nacted as a transcriptional repressor and interacted with the transcriptional \ncorepressor SIN3A complex. Genome-wide interrogation of transcriptional targets \nrevealed that the ZNF704/SIN3A complex represses a panel of genes including PER2 \nthat are critically involved in the function of the circadian clock. \nOverexpression of ZNF704 prolonged the period and dampened the amplitude of the \ncircadian clock. ZNF704 promoted the proliferation and invasion of breast cancer \ncells in vitro and accelerated the growth and metastasis of breast cancer in \nvivo. Consistently, the level of ZNF704 expression inversely correlated with \nthat of PER2 in breast carcinomas, and high level of ZNF704 correlated with \nadvanced histologic grades, lymph node positivity, and poor prognosis of \npatients with breast cancer, especially those with HER2+ and basal-like \nsubtypes. These results indicate that ZNF704 is an important regulator of the \ncircadian clock and a potential driver for breast carcinogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: \nThis study indicates that ZNF704 could be a potential oncogenic factor, \ndisrupting circadian rhythm of breast cancer cells and contributing to breast \ncarcinogenesis.",

Therefore, to further understand the mechanism \nunderlying melanoma pathogenesis could be helpful for developing novel \ntherapeutic strategy. A20 is a crucial ubiquitin-editing enzyme implicated \nimmunity regulation, inflammatory responses and cancer pathogenesis. Herein, we \nreport that A20 played an oncogenic role in melanoma.

Then, \nwe showed that knockdown of A20 suppressed melanoma cell proliferation in vitro \nand melanoma growth in vivo through the regulation of cell-cycle progression. \nMoreover, A20 could potentiate the invasive and migratory capacities of melanoma \ncell in vitro and melanoma metastasis in vivo by promoting \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, we found that Akt \nactivation mediated the oncogenic effect of A20 on melanoma development, with \nthe involvement of glycolysis. What's more, the up-regulation of A20 conferred \nthe acquired resistance to Vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant melanoma. Taken together, \nwe demonstrated that up-regulated A20 promoted melanoma progression via the \nactivation of Akt pathway, and that A20 could be exploited as a potential \ntherapeutic target for melanoma treatment.",

Here, we initially \nfocused on the bleomycin genotoxin because of the limited information about the \ngenes implicated in the sensitivity or resistance to this compound. Using a \nwhole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout approach, we identified ASH2L, a core \ncomponent of the H3K4 methyl transferase complex, as a protein required for \nbleomycin sensitivity in L1236 Hodgkin lymphoma. Knocking down ASH2L in these \ncells and in the NT2D1 testicular cancer cell line rendered them resistant to \nbleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin but did not affect their sensitivity toward \nATM or ATR inhibitors. ASH2L knockdown decreased cell proliferation and \nfacilitated DNA repair via homologous recombination and nonhomologous \nend-joining mechanisms. Data from the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas indicate that \npatients with testicular cancer carrying alterations in the ASH2L gene are more \nlikely to relapse than patients with unaltered ASH2L genes. The cell models we \nhave used are derived from cancers currently treated either partially (Hodgkin's \nlymphoma), or entirely (testicular cancer) with genotoxins. For such cancers, \nASH2L levels could be used as a biomarker to predict the response to genotoxins. \nIn situations where tumors are expressing low levels of ASH2L, which may allow \nthem to resist genotoxic treatment, the use of ATR or ATM inhibitors may be more \nefficacious as our data indicate that ASH2L knockdown does not affect \nsensitivity to these inhibitors.",

Drosophila \nJumeau (Jumu), a member of this family, participates in cardiogenesis, \nhematopoiesis and immune system homeostasis. Here, we show that loss of jumu \nfunction positively regulates or triggers apoptosis via a JNK-dependent pathway \nin wing development. jumu mutants showed reduced wing size and increased \napoptosis. Moreover, we observed a loss of the anterior cross vein (ACV) \nphenotype that was similar to that observed in wings in which JNK signaling has \nbeen ectopically activated. The JNK signaling markers puckered (puc) and p-JNK \nwere also significantly increased in the wing discs of jumu mutants. In \naddition, apoptosis induced by the loss of jumu was rescued by knocking down \nJNK, indicating a role for JNK in reducing jumu-induced apoptosis. Jumu could \nalso control wing margin development via the positive regulation of cut \nexpression, and the observed wing margin defect did not result from a loss of \njumu-induced apoptosis. Further, jumu deficiency in the pupal wing could induce \nmultiple wing hairs via a Rho1-mediated planar cell polarity pathway, but \nabnormal Rho1 expression was not why jumu loss induced apoptosis via a \nJNK-dependent pathway in wing discs.",

Mutations in \ngenes that ensure genome stability lead to human developmental syndromes. \nMutations in Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) or in ATR-interacting \nprotein (ATRIP) lead to Seckel syndrome, which is characterized by developmental \nmalformations and short life expectancy. While the roles of ATR in replicative \nstress response and chromosomal segregation are well established, it is unknown \nhow ATRIP contributes to maintaining genomic stability in progenitor cells in \nvivo. Here, we generated the first mouse model to investigate ATRIP function. \nConditional inactivation of Atrip in progenitor cells of the CNS and eye led to \nmicrocephaly, microphthalmia and postnatal lethality. To understand the \nmechanisms underlying these malformations, we used lens progenitor cells as a \nmodel and found that ATRIP loss promotes replicative stress and TP53-dependent \ncell death. Trp53 inactivation in Atrip-deficient progenitor cells rescued \napoptosis, but increased mitotic DNA damage and mitotic defects.

However, the \nmolecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we studied the role of mPGES-1/PGE2 \ncascade in activating Stat3 signaling and the contribution of Stat3 in PGE2- and \nAdr-induced podocyte apoptosis. In murine podocytes, PGE2 dose- and \ntime-dependently increased the phosphorylation of Stat3 in line with the \nenhanced cell apoptosis and reduced podocyte protein podocin. In agreement with \nthe increased Stat3 phosphorylation, Stat3-derived cytokines including IL-6, \nIL-17, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 were significantly upregulated following PGE2 \ntreatment. By application of a specific Stat3 inhibitor S3I-201, PGE2-induced \npodocyte apoptosis was largely abolished in parallel with a blockade of podocin \nreduction. Next, we observed that Adr treatment also enhanced p-Stat3 and \nactivated mPGES-1/PGE2 cascade. Blockade of Stat3 by S3I-201 significantly \nameliorated Adr-induced cell apoptosis and podocin reduction. More \ninterestingly, silencing mPGES-1 in podocytes by mPGES-1 siRNA blocked \nAdr-induced increments of Stat-3 phosphorylation, PGE2 production, and \nStat3-derived inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, this study suggested that \nmPGES-1-derived PGE2 could activate Stat3 signaling to promote podocyte \napoptosis. Targeting mPGES-1/PGE2/Stat3 signaling might be a potential strategy \nfor the treatment of podocytopathy.",

However, the underlying mechanism \nremains largely unclear. Here, we show that m6A plays a critical role in \nregulating macroautophagy/autophagy and adipogenesis through targeting Atg5 and \nAtg7. Mechanistically, knockdown of FTO, a well-known m6A demethylase, decreased \nthe expression of ATG5 and ATG7, leading to attenuation of autophagosome \nformation, thereby inhibiting autophagy and adipogenesis. We proved that FTO \ndirectly targeted Atg5 and Atg7 transcripts and mediated their expression in an \nm6A-dependent manner. Further study identified that Atg5 and Atg7 were the \ntargets of YTHDF2 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2). Upon FTO \nsilencing, Atg5 and Atg7 transcripts with higher m6A levels were captured by \nYTHDF2, which resulted in mRNA degradation and reduction of protein expression, \nthus alleviating autophagy and adipogenesis. Furthermore, we generated an \nadipose-selective fto knockout mouse and find that FTO deficiency decreased \nwhite fat mass and impairs ATG5- and ATG7-dependent autophagy in vivo. Together, \nthese findings unveil the functional importance of the m6A methylation machinery \nin autophagy and adipogenesis regulation, which expands our understanding of \nsuch interplay that is essential for development of therapeutic strategies in \nthe prevention and treatment of obesity.",

            "TEXT": "Splicing factor SF3B1 promotes endometrial cancer progression via regulating \nKSR2 RNA maturation.\n\nAlthough endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive \ntract, we have little understanding of what controls endometrial cancer beyond \nthe transcriptional effects of steroid hormones such as estrogen. As a result, \nwe have limited therapeutic options for the ~62,000 women diagnosed with \nendometrial cancer each year in the United States. Here, in an attempt to \nidentify new prognostic and therapeutic targets, we focused on a new area for \nthis cancer-alternative mRNA splicing-and investigated whether splicing factor, \nSF3B1, plays an important role in endometrial cancer pathogenesis. Using a \ntissue microarray, we found that human endometrial tumors expressed more SF3B1 \nprotein than non-cancerous tissues. Furthermore, SF3B1 knockdown reduced in \nvitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of the endometrial cancer cell \nlines Ishikawa and AN3CA. Similarly, the SF3B1 inhibitor, Pladienolide-B \n(PLAD-B), reduced the Ishikawa and AN3CA cell proliferation and invasion in \nvitro. Moreover, PLAD-B reduced tumor growth in an orthotopic endometrial cancer \nmouse model. Using RNA-Seq approach, we identified ~2000 differentially \nexpressed genes (DEGs) with SF3B1 knockdown in endometrial cancer cells. \nAdditionally, alternative splicing (AS) events analysis revealed that SF3B1 \ndepletion led to alteration in multiple categories of AS events including \nalternative exon skipping (ES), transcript start site usage (TSS), and \ntranscript termination site (TTS) usage. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis \nshowed KSR2 as a potential candidate for SF3B1-mediated functions in endometrial \ncancer. Specifically, loss of SF3B1 led to decrease in KSR2 expression, owing to \nreduced maturation of KSR2 pre-mRNA to a mature RNA. Importantly, we found \nrescuing the KSR2 expression with SF3B1 knockdown partially restored the cell \ngrowth of endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggest that SF3B1 \nplays a crucial oncogenic role in the tumorigenesis of endometrial cancer and \nhence may support the development of SF3B1 inhibitors to treat this disease.",

            "TEXT": "TRAF6 inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis through regulating selective \nautophagic CTNNB1/β-catenin degradation and is targeted for GSK3B/GSK3β-mediated \nphosphorylation and degradation.\n\nAberrant CTNNB1 signaling is one of the fundamental processes in cancers, \nespecially colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we reported that TRAF6, an E3 \nubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling, inhibited \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CRC metastasis through driving a \nselective autophagic CTNNB1 degradation machinery. Mechanistically, TRAF6 \ninteracted with MAP1LC3B/LC3B through its LC3-interacting region 'YxxL' and \ncatalyzed K63-linked polyubiquitination of LC3B. The K63-linked ubiquitination \nof LC3B promoted the formation of the LC3B-ATG7 complex and was critical to the \nsubsequent recognition of CTNNB1 by LC3B for the selective autophagic \ndegradation. However, TRAF6 was phosphorylated at Thr266 by GSK3B in most \nclinical CRC, which triggered K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of \nTRAF6 and thereby attenuated its inhibitory activity towards the \nautophagy-dependent CTNNB1 signaling. Clinically, decreased expression of TRAF6 \nwas associated with elevated GSK3B protein levels and activity and reduced \noverall survival in CRC patients. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B activity \nstabilized the TRAF6 protein, promoted CTNNB1 degradation, and effectively \nsuppressed EMT and CRC metastasis. Thus, targeting TRAF6 and its pathway may be \nmeaningful for treating advanced CRC.",

ARTS \nacts upstream of mitochondria to initiate caspase activation. ARTS induces \napoptosis by specifically binding XIAP and allowing de-repression of active \ncaspases required for Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilzation (MOMP). \nMoreover, ARTS promotes apoptosis by inducing ubiquitin-mediated degradation of \nboth major anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP and Bcl-2. In the resolution phase of \ninflammation, the infiltrating leukocytes, which execute the acute innate \nresponse, undergo apoptosis and are subsequently cleared by phagocytic \nmacrophages (i.e. efferocytosis). In this course, macrophages undergo \nreprogramming from inflammatory, to anti-inflammatory, and eventually to \nresolving macrophages that leave the injury sites. Since engulfment of apoptotic \nleukocytes is a key signaling step in macrophage reprogramming and resolution of \ninflammation, we hypothesized that a failed apoptosis in leukocytes in vivo \nwould result in an impaired resolution process. To test this hypothesis, we \nutilized the Sept4/ARTS-/- mice, which exhibit resistance to apoptosis in many \ncell types. During zymosan A-induced peritonitis, Sept4/ARTS-/- mice exhibited \nimpaired resolution of inflammation, characterized by reduced neutrophil \napoptosis, macrophage efferocytosis and expression of pro-resolving mediators. \nThis was associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced \nanti-inflammatory cytokines, secreted by resolution-phase macrophages. Moreover, \nARTS overexpression in leukocytes in vitro promoted an anti-inflammatory \nbehavior. Overall, our results suggest that ARTS is a key master-regulator \nnecessary for neutrophil apoptosis, macrophage efferocytosis and reprogramming \nto the pro-resolving phenotype during the resolution of inflammation.",

However, \nthe mechanism by which BST2 uses the selective autophagy pathway to inhibit \nviral replication is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that BST2 \nexpression was significantly increased during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus \n(PEDV) infection of Vero cells by IRF1 targeting its promoter. We also showed \nthat BST2 suppressed PEDV replication by binding and degrading the PEDV-encoded \nnucleocapsid (N) protein. The downregulation of N protein was blocked by \nmacroautophagy/autophagy inhibitors but not a proteasome inhibitor, implying \nthat the N protein was degraded via the selective autophagy pathway. Both the \nBST2 and N protein interacted with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF8/MARCH8 and \nthe cargo receptor CALCOCO2/NDP52, and the ubiquitination of N protein was \nnecessary for the degradation of N mediated by the BST2-MARCHF8 axis. The \nknockdown of MARCHF8 or ATG5 with small interfering RNAs blocked the selective \nautophagy pathway, rescued the protein abundance of PEDV N in 293T cells, and \nprevented the inhibition of PEDV replication by BST2 in Vero cells. Together, \nour data demonstrate the novel mechanism of BST2-mediated virus restriction, in \nwhich BST2 recruits MARCHF8 to catalyze the ubiquitination of the PEDV N \nprotein. The ubiquitinated N protein is then recognized by CALCOCO2/NDP52, which \ndelivers it to autolysosome for degradation through the selective autophagy \npathway.",

            "TEXT": "Exosome-transferred LINC01559 promotes the progression of gastric cancer via \nPI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n\nIncreasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated \nwith the progression of human cancers. However, the expression level and \nfunction of LINC01559 (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1559) in gastric \ncancer (GC) are rarely reported. Here we found that LINC01559 was upregulated in \nGC tissues based on GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) and \nTCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) databases. Also, LINC01559 was expressed at a \nlower level in GC cells than in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In vitro \nexperiments revealed that silencing LINC01559 remarkably hindered GC cell \nproliferation, migration and stemness. Then, we identified that LINC01559 was \ntransmitted form MSCs to GC cells via the exosomes. Immunofluorescence staining \nand electron microscope validated the existence of exosomes in GC cells. \nMechanistically, LINC01559 sponged miR-1343-3p to upregulate PGK1 \n(phosphoglycerate kinase 1), therefore activating PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, \nLINC01559 recruited EZH2 (enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 \nsubunit) to PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) promoter, inducing the \nmethylation of PTEN promoter and finally resulting in PTEN repression. Of note, \nLINC01559 targeted both PGK1 and PTEN to promote GC progression by activating \nPI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrated that LINC01559 \naccelerated GC progression via upregulating PGK1 and downregulating PTEN to \ntrigger phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) \npathway, indicating LINC01559 as a potential biomarker for GC treatment.",

            "TEXT": "Infiltrating Mast Cell-Mediated Stimulation of Estrogen Receptor Activity in \nBreast Cancer Cells Promotes the Luminal Phenotype.\n\nTumor growth and development is determined by both cancer cell-autonomous and \nmicroenvironmental mechanisms, including the contribution of infiltrating immune \ncells. Because the role of mast cells (MC) in this process is poorly \ncharacterized and even controversial, we investigated their part in breast \ncancer. Crossing C57BL/6 MMTV-PyMT mice, which spontaneously develop mammary \ncarcinomas, with MC-deficient C57BL/6-KitW-sh/W-sh (Wsh) mice, showed that MCs \npromote tumor growth and prevent the development of basal CK5-positive areas in \nfavor of a luminal gene program. When cocultured with breast cancer cells in \nvitro, MCs hindered activation of cMET, a master regulator of the basal program, \nand simultaneously promoted expression and activation of estrogen receptor \n(ESR1/ER) and its target genes (PGR, KRT8/CK8, BCL2), which are all luminal \nmarkers. Moreover, MCs reduced ERBB2/HER2 levels, whose inhibition further \nincreased ESR1 expression. In vivo and in silico analysis of patients with \nbreast cancer revealed a direct correlation between MC density and ESR1 \nexpression. In mice engrafted with HER2-positive breast cancer tumors, \ncoinjection of MCs increased tumor engraftment and outgrowth, supporting the \nlink between MCs and increased risk of relapse in patients with breast cancer. \nTogether, our findings support the notion that MCs influence the phenotype of \nbreast cancer cells by stimulating a luminal phenotype and ultimately modifying \nthe outcome of the disease.",

Here we demonstrate \nan important role of macroautophagy/autophagy (especially mitophagy) in the \nprotective effect of IPC in kidneys. IPC induced autophagy in renal tubular \ncells in mice and suppressed subsequent renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). \nThe protective effect of IPC was abolished by pharmacological inhibitors of \nautophagy and by the ablation of Atg7 from kidney proximal tubules. Pretreatment \nwith BECN1/Beclin1 peptide induced autophagy and protected against IRI. These \nresults suggest the dependence of IPC protection on renal autophagy. During IPC, \nthe mitophagy regulator PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) was activated. \nBoth IPC and BECN1 peptide enhanced mitolysosome formation during renal IRI in \nmitophagy reporter mice, suggesting that IPC may protect kidneys by activating \nmitophagy. We further established an in vitro model of IPC by inducing 'chemical \nischemia' in kidney proximal tubular cells with carbonyl cyanide \n3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Brief treatment with CCCP protected against \nsubsequent injury in these cells and the protective effect was abrogated by \nautophagy inhibition. In vitro IPC increased mitophagosome formation, enhanced \nthe delivery of mitophagosomes to lysosomes, and promoted the clearance of \ndamaged mitochondria during subsequent CCCP treatment. IPC also suppressed \nmitochondrial depolarization, improved ATP production, and inhibited the \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Pink1 suppressed mitophagy \nand reduced the cytoprotective effect of IPC. Together, these results suggest \nthat autophagy, especially mitophagy, plays an important role in the protective \neffect of IPC.",

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the core machinery of autophagy is well \ndefined, but its transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8 \n(autophagy-related 8) protein plays central roles in decorating autophagosomes \nand binding to specific cargo receptors to recruit cargo to autophagosomes. We \npropose that the transcriptional control of ATG8 genes is important during the \nformation of autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during stress. \nHere, we describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for transcription factors \n(TFs) that regulate ATG8 gene expression in Arabidopsis, using the promoters of \n4 ATG8 genes. We identified a total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these \npromoters. The TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF \nfamilies for different promoters, as well as enrichment for families of TFs that \nbound to specific fragments. These TFs are not only involved in plant \ndevelopmental processes but also in the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 \n(TGACG (TGA) motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive \nregulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy under both \ncontrol and stress conditions and transcriptionally up-regulated expression of \nATG8B, ATG8E and additional ATG genes via binding to their promoters. Our \nresults provide a comprehensive resource of TFs that regulate ATG8 gene \nexpression and lay a foundation for understanding the transcriptional regulation \nof plant autophagy.",

Recent studies have revealed that \nRNA-binding proteins (RBP) are involved in tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate \nthat PSF/SFPQ is an RBP that potentially predicts poor prognosis of patients \nwith ER-positive breast cancer by posttranscriptionally regulating ERα (ESR1) \nmRNA expression. Strong PSF immunoreactivity correlated with shorter overall \nsurvival in patients with ER-positive breast cancer. PSF was predominantly \nexpressed in a model of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, and depletion \nof PSF attenuated proliferation of cultured cells and xenografted tumors. PSF \nexpression was significantly associated with estrogen signaling. PSF siRNA \ndownregulated ESR1 mRNA by inhibiting nuclear export of the RNA. Integrative \nanalyses of microarray and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing also identified \nSCFD2, TRA2B, and ASPM as targets of PSF. Among the PSF targets, SCFD2 was a \npoor prognostic indicator of breast cancer and SCFD2 knockdown significantly \nsuppressed breast cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, this study shows that \nPSF plays a pathophysiologic role in ER-positive breast cancer by \nposttranscriptionally regulating expression of its target genes such as ESR1 and \nSCFD2. Overall, PSF and SCFD2 could be potential diagnostic and therapeutic \ntargets for primary and hormone-refractory breast cancers.",

We examined \na growth suppressive activity of CP-31398 which was developed to restore the p53 \nfunctions irrespective of the genotype in mesothelioma with wild-type or mutated \np53. CP-31398 up-regulated p53 levels in cells with wild-type p53 genotype but \ninduced cell growth suppression in a p53-independent manner.

We \ninvestigated a combinatory effect of CP-31398 and nutlin-2a and found the \ncombination produced synergistic growth inhibition in mesothelioma with the \nwild-type p53 but not with mutated p53.

Herein, we demonstrate that \nmice deficient for REGγ, a proteasome activator, exhibited a significant \nreduction in tumor size, numbers, and metastatic rate with prolonged survival in \na conditional Kras/p53 mutant lung cancer model.

Activated TGFβ signaling in REGγ-positive lung \ncancer cells led to diminished expression of E-cadherin, a biomarker of \nepithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), and elevated mesenchymal markers \ncompared with REGγ-deficient lung cancer cells. REGγ overexpression was found in \nlung cancer patients with metastasis, correlating with the reduction of \nE-Cadherin/Smad7 and a poor prognosis.

To this end, we \ncarried out unbiased mass spectrometry-based metabolomic and proteomic profiling \nof cancer cells cocultured with primary human omental adipocytes. Cancer cells \nunderwent significant proteo-metabolomic alteration(s), typified by changes in \nthe lipidome with corresponding upregulation of lipid metabolism proteins. \nFABP4, a lipid chaperone protein, was identified as the critical regulator of \nlipid responses in ovarian cancer cells cocultured with adipocytes. \nSubsequently, knockdown of FABP4 resulted in increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine \nlevels in the DNA, downregulation of gene signatures associated with ovarian \ncancer metastasis, and reduced clonogenic cancer cell survival. In addition, \nclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated \nknockout of FABP4 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells reduced metastatic \ntumor burden in mice. Consequently, a small-molecule inhibitor of FABP4 \n(BMS309403) not only significantly reduced tumor burden in a syngeneic \northotopic mouse model but also increased the sensitivity of cancer cells toward \ncarboplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results show that \ntargeting FABP4 in ovarian cancer cells can inhibit their ability to adapt and \ncolonize lipid-rich tumor microenvironments, providing an opportunity for \nspecific metabolic targeting of ovarian cancer metastasis.

Here, we investigate the \ninfluence of the nutrient sensing and longevity-assuring enzyme SIRT6 on the \ndynamics of apoptosis triggered by serum starvation. Specifically, we \ncharacterize the progression of apoptosis in wild type and SIRT6 deficient mouse \nembryonic fibroblasts using time-lapse flow cytometry and computational \nmodelling based on rate-equations and cell distribution analysis. We find that \nSIRT6 deficient cells resist apoptosis by delaying its initiation. \nInterestingly, once apoptosis is initiated, the rate of its progression is \nhigher in SIRT6 null cells compared to identically cultured wild type cells. \nHowever, SIRT6 null cells succumb to apoptosis more slowly, not only in response \nto nutrient deprivation but also in response to other stresses. Our data suggest \nthat SIRT6 plays a role in several distinct steps of apoptosis. Overall, we \ndemonstrate the utility of our computational model to describe stages of \napoptosis progression and the integrity of the cellular membrane. Such \nmeasurements will be useful in a broad range of biological applications.",

Using these mice to investigate therapeutics for AITL, we found that \ndasatinib, a multikinase inhibitor prolonged their survival through inhibition \nof hyperactivated TCR signaling. A phase I clinical trial study of dasatinib \nmonotherapy in 5 patients with relapsed/refractory AITL was performed.

Recent advance revealed that the sensitivity to \nferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including \nmetabolism of amino acid and the biosynthesis of glutathione. Here, by using a \nhigh-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen in HepG2 hepatocellular \ncarcinoma cells to search for metabolic proteins inhibiting ferroptosis, we \nidentified a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) as a novel \nsuppressor of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, ferroptosis inducers (erastin, \nsorafenib, and sulfasalazine) activated AMPK/SREBP1 signaling pathway through \niron-dependent ferritinophagy, which in turn inhibited BCAT2 transcription. We \nfurther confirmed that BCAT2 as the key enzyme mediating the metabolism of \nsulfur amino acid, regulated intracellular glutamate level, whose activation by \nectopic expression specifically antagonize system Xc- inhibition and protected \nliver and pancreatic cancer cells from ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. On the \ncontrary, direct inhibition of BCAT2 by RNA interference, or indirect inhibition \nby blocking system Xc- activity, triggers ferroptosis. Finally, our results \ndemonstrate the synergistic effect of sorafenib and sulfasalazine in \ndownregulating BCAT2 expression and dictating ferroptotic death, where BCAT2 can \nalso be used to predict the responsiveness of cancer cells to \nferroptosis-inducing therapies. Collectively, these findings identify a novel \nrole of BCAT2 in ferroptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for \novercoming sorafenib resistance.",

However, the clinical significance of specific \nlncRNAs in the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the molecular \nmechanisms by which they regulate this form of cancer remain largely unclear. In \nthis study we found that the lncRNA PVT1 was upregulated in NPC, and that in \npatients this upregulation was associated with reduced survival. RNA sequencing \nrevealed that PVT1 was responsible for regulating NPC cell proliferation and for \ncontrolling a hypoxia-related phenotype in these cells. PVT1 knockdown reduced \nNPC cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenesis in a subcutaneous \nmouse xenograft model systems. We further found that PVT1 serves as a scaffold \nfor the chromatin modification factor KAT2A, which mediates histone 3 lysine 9 \nacetylation (H3K9), recruiting the nuclear receptor binding protein TIF1β to \nactivate NF90 transcription, thereby increasing HIF-1α stability and promoting a \nmalignant phenotype in NPC cells. Overexpression of NF90 or HIF-1α restored the \nproliferation in cells that had ceased proliferating due to PVT1 or KAT2A \ndepletion. Conversely, overexpression of active KAT2A or TIF1β, but not of KAT2A \nacetyltransferase activity-deficient mutants or TIF1β isoforms lacking H3K9ac \nbinding sites, promoted a PVT1-mediated increase in NF90 transcription, as well \nas increased HIF-1α stability and cell proliferation. PVT1 knockdown enhanced \nthe radiosensitization effect in NPC cells via inhibiting binding between H3K9ac \nand TIF1β in a manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PVT1 serves \nan oncogenic role and plays an important role in radiosensitivity in malignant \nNPC via activating the KAT2A acetyltransferase and stabilizing HIF-1α.",

            "TEXT": "MTORC1 coordinates the autophagy and apoptosis signaling in articular \nchondrocytes in osteoarthritic temporomandibular joint.\n\nA switch from autophagy to apoptosis is implicated in chondrocytes during the \nosteoarthritis (OA) progression with currently unknown mechanism(s). In this \nstudy we utilized a flow fluid shear stress (FFSS) model in cultured \nchondrocytes and a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) animal model. We found \nthat both FFSS and UAC actively induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in \nthe temporomandibular joints (TMJ) chondrocytes, as demonstrated by dramatic \nincreases in expression of HSPA5, p-EIF2AK3, p-ERN1 and ATF6. Interestingly, \nboth FFSS and UAC activated not only pro-death p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS-apoptosis \nprograms but also pro-survival p-ERN1-mediated autophagic flux in chondrocytes. \nData from FFSS demonstrated that MTORC1, a downstream of p-ERN1, suppressed \nautophagy but promoted p-EIF2AK3 mediated ERS-apoptosis. Data from UAC model \ndemonstrated that at early stage both the p-ERN1 and p-EIF2AK3 were activated \nand MTORC1 was inhibited in TMJ chondrocytes. At late stage, \nMTORC1-p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS apoptosis were predominant, while p-ERN1 and \nautophagic flux were inhibited. Inhibition of MTORC1 by TMJ local injection of \nrapamycin in rats or inducible ablation of MTORC1 expression selectively in \nchondrocytes in mice promoted chondrocyte autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, \nand reduced TMJ cartilage loss induced by UAC. In contrast, MTORC1 activation by \nTMJ local administration of MHY1485 or genetic deletion of Tsc1, an upstream \nMTORC1 suppressor, resulted in opposite effects. Collectively, our results \nestablish that aberrant mechanical loading causes cartilage degeneration by \nactivating, at least in part, the MTORC1 signaling which modulates the autophagy \nand apoptosis programs in TMJ chondrocytes. Thus, inhibition of MTORC1 provides \na novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of OA.",

            "TEXT": "Small GTPase RAB6 deficiency promotes alveolar progenitor cell renewal and \nattenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis.\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease \ncharacterized by chronic non-specific inflammation of the interstitial lung and \nextensive deposition of collagen fibers leading to destruction of lung function. \nStudies have demonstrated that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) \nincreases the risk of IPF. In order to recover from PM2.5-induced lung injury, \nalveolar epithelial cells need to be repaired and regenerated to maintain lung \nfunction. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) are stem cells in the adult \nlung that contribute to the lung repair process through complex signaling. Our \nprevious studies demonstrated that RAB6, a RAS family member lowly expressed in \nlung cancer, inhibited lung cancer stem cell self-renewal, but it is unclear \nwhether or not and how RAB6 may regulate AEC2 cell proliferation and \nself-renewal in PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that \nknockout of RAB6 inhibited pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and AEC2 cell \ndeath in PM2.5-injured mice. In addition, knockout of RAB6 decreased Dickkopf \n1(DKK1) autocrine and activated proliferation, self-renewal, and wnt/β-catenin \nsignaling of PM2.5-injured AEC2 cells. RAB6 overexpression increased DKK1 \nautocrine and inhibited proliferation, self-renewal and wnt/β-catenin signaling \nin AEC2 cells in vitro. Furthermore, DKK1 inhibitors promoted proliferation, \nself-renewal and wnt/β-catenin signaling of RAB6 overexpressing AEC2 cells, and \nattenuated PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These data establish RAB6 \nas a regulator of DKK1 autocrine and wnt/β-catenin signal that serves to \nregulate AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal, and suggest a mechanism that \nRAB6 disruption may promote AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal to enhance \nlung repair following PM2.5 injury.",

Here we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 5 \n(PRMT5) as a new metastasis-promoting factor in laryngeal carcinoma, and explore \nits underlying mechanism of action in regulating laryngeal cancer progression. \nWe illustrated that PRMT5 expression was positively correlated with tumor \nstages, lymphatic metastasis, and unfavorable outcome. Functional assays \nrevealed that PRMT5 promoted laryngeal carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, \nand invasive capacity in vitro, as well as lymph-node metastasis in vivo. The \nectopic expression of PRMT5 induced EMT with downregulation of E-cadherin and \nupregulation of N-cadherin, snail, and MMP9. Mechanistic results revealed that \nthe metastatic effects could be attributed to PRMT5-mediated activation of Wnt \nsignaling, and Wnt4 is an important driver of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. \nWnt4 silencing could reverse PRMT5-induced cell proliferation, migration, and \ninvasion capacities. Furthermore, inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling \npathway abolished the effect of PRMT5-induced proliferation, whereas activation \nof the pathway enhanced the effect of PRMT5 overexpression on cell \nproliferation. These results demonstrated that the oncogenic role of PRMT5 could \nbe attributed to PRMT5/Wnt4 axis-mediated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin \nsignaling pathway. PRMT5 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a \ntherapeutic target for lymphatic metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma.",

            "TEXT": "Blockade of EIF5A hypusination limits colorectal cancer growth by inhibiting MYC \nelongation.\n\nEukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A (EIF5A) is a translation factor \nregulated by hypusination, a unique posttranslational modification catalyzed by \ndeoxyhypusine synthetase (DHPS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) starting \nfrom the polyamine spermidine. Emerging data are showing that hypusinated EIF5A \nregulates key cellular processes such as autophagy, senescence, polyamine \nhomeostasis, energy metabolism, and plays a role in cancer. However, the effects \nof EIF5A inhibition in preclinical cancer models, the mechanism of action, and \nspecific translational targets are still poorly understood. We show here that \nhypusinated EIF5A promotes growth of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells by directly \nregulating MYC biosynthesis at specific pausing motifs. Inhibition of EIF5A \nhypusination with the DHPS inhibitor GC7 or through lentiviral-mediated \nknockdown of DHPS or EIF5A reduces the growth of various CRC cells. Multiplex \ngene expression analysis reveals that inhibition of hypusination impairs the \nexpression of transcripts regulated by MYC, suggesting the involvement of this \noncogene in the observed effect. Indeed, we demonstrate that EIF5A regulates MYC \nelongation without affecting its mRNA content or protein stability, by \nalleviating ribosome stalling at five distinct pausing motifs in MYC CDS. Of \nnote, we show that blockade of the hypusination axis elicits a remarkable growth \ninhibitory effect in preclinical models of CRC and significantly reduces the \nsize of polyps in APCMin/+ mice, a model of human familial adenomatous polyposis \n(FAP). Together, these data illustrate an unprecedented mechanism, whereby the \ntumor-promoting properties of hypusinated EIF5A are linked to its ability to \nregulate MYC elongation and provide a rationale for the use of DHPS/EIF5A \ninhibitors in CRC therapy.",

Using fibroblasts derived \nfrom Neat1-/- mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53 pathway. \nWe found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in \nresponse to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in \nsuppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency \nenhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the \ndevelopment of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and \ncystic lesions in KrasG12D-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes \nin gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes \nneoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large \nintergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and \ncancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor \nsuppression.",

            "TEXT": "Nuclear miR-30b-5p suppresses TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy.\n\nLysosome is a crucial organelle in charge of degrading proteins and damaged \norganelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is \nthe master transcription factor regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. \nUnder external stimuli such as starvation, dephosphorylated TFEB transports into \nthe nucleus to specifically recognize and bind to the coordinated lysosomal \nexpression and regulation (CLEAR) elements at the promotors of autophagy and \nlysosomal biogenesis-related genes. The function of TFEB in the nucleus is fine \nregulated but the molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, we \ndiscovered that miR-30b-5p, a small RNA which is known to regulate a series of \ngenes through posttranscriptional regulation in the cytoplasm, was translocated \ninto the nucleus, bound to the CLEAR elements, suppressed the transcription of \nTFEB-dependent downstream genes, and further inhibited the lysosomal biogenesis \nand the autophagic flux; meanwhile, knocking out the endogenous miR-30b-5p by \nCRISPR/Cas9 technique significantly increased the TFEB-mediated transactivation, \nresulting in the increased expression of autophagy and lysosomal \nbiogenesis-related genes. Overexpressing miR-30b-5p in mice livers showed a \ndecrease in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. These in vitro and in vivo data \nindicate that miR-30b-5p may inhibit the TFEB-dependent transactivation by \nbinding to the CLEAR elements in the nucleus to regulate the lysosomal \nbiogenesis and autophagy. This novel mechanism of nuclear miRNA regulating gene \ntranscription is conducive to further elucidating the roles of miRNAs in the \nlysosomal physiological functions and helps to understand the pathogenesis of \nabnormal autophagy-related diseases.",

            "TEXT": "ZNNT1 long noncoding RNA induces autophagy to inhibit tumorigenesis of uveal \nmelanoma by regulating key autophagy gene expression.\n\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are proved to be critical regulators in numerous \ncellular processes. However, the potential involvement of lncRNAs in \nmacroautophagy/autophagy is largely unknown. Autophagy is a highly regulated \ncellular degradation system, and its dysregulation is involved in many human \ndiseases, including cancers. Here, we show that the lncRNA ZNNT1 is induced by \nPP242 and MTORC1 selective inhibitor rapamycin in uveal melanoma (UM) cells. \nOverexpression of ZNNT1 promotes autophagy by upregulating ATG12 expression, \nwhereas knockdown of ZNNT1 attenuates PP242-induced autophagy. Overexpression of \nZNNT1 inhibits tumorigenesis and the migration of UM cells, and knockdown of \nATG12 can partially rescue the ZNNT1-induced inhibition of UM tumorigenesis. In \nsummary, our study reveals that ZNNT1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in UM \nby inducing autophagy.",

However, \nthe mechanisms regulating the functions of AGO2 in cancer still remain elusive. \nHerein, we indentify one intronic circular RNA (circRNA) generated from AGO2 \ngene (circAGO2) as a novel regulator of AGO2-miRNA complexes and cancer \nprogression. CircAGO2 is up-regulated in gastric cancer, colon cancer, prostate \ncancer, and neuroblastoma, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. \nCircAGO2 promotes the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro \nand in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that circAGO2 physically interacts with \nhuman antigen R (HuR) protein to facilitate its activation and enrichment on the \n3'-untranslated region of target genes, resulting in reduction of AGO2 binding \nand repression of AGO2/miRNA-mediated gene silencing associated with cancer \nprogression. Pre-clinically, administration of lentivirus-mediated short hairpin \nRNA targeting circAGO2 inhibits the expression of downstream target genes, and \nsuppresses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of xenografts in nude mice. In \naddition, blocking the interaction between circAGO2 and HuR by cell-penetrating \ninhibitory peptide represses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of cancer \ncells. Taken together, these results indicate that oncogenic circAGO2 drives \ncancer progression through facilitating HuR-repressed functions of AGO2-miRNA \ncomplexes.",

In agreement, RAD52 \nwas dispensable for DSB-induced telomere synthesis. Moreover, a targeted CRISPR \nscreen revealed that loss of the structure-specific endonuclease scaffold SLX4 \nreduced the proliferation of RAD52-null ALT cells. While SLX4 was dispensable \nfor RAD52-mediated ALT telomere synthesis in G2, combined SLX4 and RAD52 loss \nresulted in elevated telomere loss, unresolved telomere recombination \nintermediates, and mitotic infidelity.

To understand the relevance of VCP \nin differentiated tissue, we inactivated it in skeletal muscle of adult mice. \nSurprisingly, knockout muscle demonstrated a necrotic myopathy with increased \nmacroautophagic/autophagic proteins and damaged lysosomes. This was not solely \ndue to a defect in autophagic degradation because age-matched mice with muscle \ninactivation of the autophagy essential protein, ATG5, did not demonstrate a \nmyopathy. Notably, myofiber necrosis was preceded by upregulation of \nLGALS3/Galectin-3, a marker of damaged lysosomes, and TFEB activation, \nsuggesting early defects in the lysosomal system. Consistent with that, myofiber \nnecrosis was recapitulated by chemical induction of lysosomal membrane \npermeabilization (LMP) in skeletal muscle. Moreover, TFEB was activated after \nLMP in cells, but activation and nuclear localization of TFEB persisted upon VCP \ninactivation or disease mutant expression. Our data identifies VCP as central \nmediator of both lysosomal clearance and biogenesis in skeletal muscle.",

            "TEXT": "RNA-binding protein ZFP36/TTP protects against ferroptosis by regulating \nautophagy signaling pathway in hepatic stellate cells.\n\nFerroptosis is a recently discovered form of programmed cell death, but its \nregulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the \nRNA-binding protein ZFP36/TTP (ZFP36 ring finger protein) plays a crucial role \nin regulating ferroptosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Upon exposure to \nferroptosis-inducing compounds, the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7/CDC4 (F-box and WD \nrepeat domain containing 7) decreased ZFP36 protein expression by recognizing \nSFSGLPS motif. FBXW7 plasmid contributed to classical ferroptotic events, \nwhereas ZFP36 plasmid impaired FBXW7 plasmid-induced HSC ferroptosis. \nInterestingly, ZFP36 plasmid inhibited macroautophagy/autophagy activation by \ndestabilizing ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1) mRNA. ATG16L1 plasmid \neliminated the inhibitory action of ZFP36 plasmid on ferroptosis, and FBXW7 \nplasmid enhanced the effect of ATG16L1 plasmid on autophagy. Importantly, ZFP36 \nplasmid promoted ATG16L1 mRNA decay via binding to the AU-rich elements (AREs) \nwithin the 3'-untranslated region. The internal mutation of the ARE region \nabrogated the ZFP36-mediated ATG16L1 mRNA instability, and prevented ZFP36 \nplasmid-mediated ferroptosis resistance. In mice, treatment with erastin and \nsorafenib alleviated murine liver fibrosis by inducing HSC ferroptosis. \nHSC-specific overexpression of Zfp36 impaired erastin- or sorafenib-induced HSC \nferroptosis. Noteworthy, we analyzed the effect of sorafenib on HSC ferroptosis \nin fibrotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib \nmonotherapy. Attractively, sorafenib monotherapy led to ZFP36 downregulation, \nferritinophagy activation, and ferroptosis induction in human HSCs. Overall, \nthese results revealed novel molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of \nferroptosis, and also identified ZFP36-autophagy-dependent ferroptosis as a \npotential target for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

            "TEXT": "GABPA is a master regulator of luminal identity and restrains aggressive \ndiseases in bladder cancer.\n\nTERT promoter mutations occur in the majority of glioblastoma, bladder cancer \n(BC), and other malignancies while the ETS family transcription factors GABPA \nand its partner GABPB1 activate the mutant TERT promoter and telomerase in these \ntumors. GABPA depletion or the disruption of the GABPA/GABPB1 complex by \nknocking down GABPB1 was shown to inhibit telomerase, thereby eliminating the \ntumorigenic potential of glioblastoma cells. GABPA/B1 is thus suggested as a \ncancer therapeutic target. However, it is unclear about its role in BC. Here we \nunexpectedly observed that GABPA ablation inhibited TERT expression, but \nrobustly increased proliferation, stem, and invasive phenotypes and cisplatin \nresistance in BC cells, while its overexpression exhibited opposite effects, and \ninhibited in vivo metastasizing in a xenograft transplant model. \nMechanistically, GABPA directly activates the transcription of FoxA1 and GATA3, \nkey transcription factors driving luminal differentiation of urothelial cells. \nConsistently, TCGA/GEO dataset analyses show that GABPA expression is correlated \npositively with luminal while negatively with basal signatures. Luminal tumors \nexpress higher GABPA than do basal ones. Lower GABPA expression is associated \nwith the GABPA gene methylation or deletion (especially in basal subtype of BC \ntumors), and predicted significantly shorter patient survival based on TCGA and \nour cohort of BC patient analyses. Taken together, GABPA dictates luminal \nidentity of BC cells and inhibits aggressive diseases in BC by promoting \ncellular differentiation despite its stimulatory effect on telomerase/TERT \nactivation. Given these biological functions and its frequent methylation and/or \ndeletion, GABPA serves as a tumor suppressor rather than oncogenic factor in BC. \nThe GABPA effect on oncogenesis is context-dependent and its targeting for \ntelomerase inhibition in BC may promote disease metastasizing.",

Nevertheless, the impact of \nscutellarin on IPF and the downstream molecular mechanism remain unclear. In \nthis study, scutellarin suppressed BLM-induced inflammation via NF-κB/NLRP3 \npathway both in vivo and in vitro. BLM significantly elevated p-p65/p65 ratio, \nIκBα degradation, and levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, caspase-11, ASC, GSDMDNterm, \nIL-1β, and IL-18, while scutellarin reversed the above alterations except for \nthat of caspase-11. Scutellarin inhibited BLM-induced epithelial-mesenchymal \ntransition (EMT) process in vivo and in vitro. The expression levels of \nEMT-related markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, matrix \nmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, were increased in BLM group, and \nsuppressed by scutellarin. The expression level of E-cadherin showed the \nopposite changes. However, overexpression of NLRP3 eliminated the \nanti-inflammation and anti-EMT functions of scutellarin in vitro. In conclusion, \nscutellarin suppressed inflammation and EMT in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis \nthrough NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling.",

Accumulating evidence \nindicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major contributor to \napoptosis in acute kidney injury. We previously reported that augmenter of liver \nregeneration (ALR) functions as an anti-apoptotic factor in H2O2-treated HK-2 \ncells although the precise mechanism underlying this action remains unclear. In \nthe present study, we investigate the role of ALR in H2O2-induced ER \nstress-mediated apoptosis. We overexpressed ALR and established a H2O2-induced \nER stress model in HK-2 cells. Overexpression of ALR reduced the level of \nreactive oxygen species and the rate of apoptosis in H2O2-treated HK-2 cells. \nUsing confocal microscopy and western blot, we observed that ALR colocalized \nwith the ER and mitochondria compartment. Moreover, ALR suppressed ER stress by \nmaintaining the morphology of the ER and reducing the levels of the ER-related \nproteins, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), phospho-protein kinase-like ER \nkinase (p-PERK), phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α) and \nC/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) significantly (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, ALR \npromoted Bcl-2 expression and suppressed Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 expression \nsignificantly during ER-stress induced apoptosis (p < 0.05). Furthermore, ALR \nattenuated calcium release from the ER, and transfer to mitochondria, under ER \nstress. To conclude, ALR alleviates H2O2-induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis in \nHK-2 cells by suppressing ER stress response and by maintaining calcium \nhomeostasis. Consequently, ALR may protect renal tubule epithelial cells from \nischemia/reperfusion induced acute kidney injury.",

            "TEXT": "METTL3 and ALKBH5 oppositely regulate m(6)A modification of TFEB mRNA, which \ndictates the fate of hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cardiomyocytes.\n\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modifications play critical roles in various \nbiological processes. However, no study addresses the role of m6A in \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that m6A modifications are increased in \nH/R-treated cardiomyocytes and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-treated mice heart. We \nfound that METTL3 (methyltransferase like 3) is the primary factor involved in \naberrant m6A modification. Silencing METTL3 enhances autophagic flux and \ninhibits apoptosis in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression of \nMETTL3 or inhibition of the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 has an opposite effect, \nsuggesting that METTL3 is a negative regulator of autophagy. Mechanistically, \nMETTL3 methylates TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy \ngenes, at two m6A residues in the 3'-UTR, which promotes the association of the \nRNA-binding protein HNRNPD with TFEB pre-mRNA and subsequently decreases the \nexpression levels of TFEB. Further experiments show that autophagic flux \nenhanced by METTL3 deficiency is TFEB dependent. In turn, TFEB regulates the \nexpression levels of METTL3 and ALKBH5 in opposite directions: it induces ALKBH5 \nand inhibits METTL3. TFEB binds to the ALKBH5 promoter and activates its \ntranscription. In contrast, inhibition of METTL3 by TFEB does not involve \ntranscriptional repression but rather downregulation of mRNA stability, thereby \nestablishing a negative feedback loop. Together, our work uncovers a critical \nlink between METTL3-ALKBH5 and autophagy, providing insight into the functional \nimportance of the reversible mRNA m6A methylation and its modulators in ischemic \nheart disease.",

            "TEXT": "Beta1 integrin inhibits apoptosis induced by cyclic stretch in annulus fibrosus \ncells via ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.\n\nLow back pain is associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) due to \ncellular loss through apoptosis. Mechanical factors play an important role in \nmaintaining the survival of the annulus fibrosus (AF) cells and the deposition \nof extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms that excessive mechanical \nforces lead to AF cell apoptosis are not clear. The present study was to look \nfor how AF cells sense mechanical changes. In vivo experiments, the involvement \nof mechanoreceptors in apoptosis was examined by RT-PCR and/or immunoblotting in \nthe lumbar spine of rats subjected to unbalanced dynamic and static forces. In \nvitro experiments, we investigated apoptotic signaling pathways in untransfected \nand transfected AF cells with the lentivirus vector for rat β1 integrin \noverexpression after cyclic stretch. Apoptosis in AF cells was assessed using \nflow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining. Western blotting was used to \nanalyze expression of β1 integrin and caspase-3 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling \nmolecules. In the rat IVDD model, unbalanced dynamic and static forces induced \napoptosis of disc cells, which corresponded to decreased expression of β1 \nintegrin. Cyclic stretch-induced apoptosis in rat AF cells correlated with the \nactivation of caspase-3 and with decreased levels of β1 integrin and the \nphosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 activation level. However, the overexpression \nof β1 integrin in AF cells ameliorated cyclic stretch-induced apoptosis and \ndecreased caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, ERK1/2-specific inhibitor promotes \napoptosis in vector β1-infected AF cells. These results suggest that the \ndisruption of β1 integrin signaling may underlie disc cell apoptosis induced by \nmechanical stress. Further work is necessary to fully elucidate the \npathophysiological mechanisms that underlie IVDD caused by unbalanced dynamic \nand static forces.",

            "TEXT": "ANXA1 Binds and Stabilizes EphA2 to Promote Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Growth and \nMetastasis.\n\nOverexpression of ANXA1 and EphA2 has been linked to various cancers and both \nproteins have attracted considerable attention for the development of new \nanticancer drugs. Here we report that ANXA1 competes with Cbl for binding EphA2 \nand increases its stability by inhibiting Cbl-mediated EphA2 ubiquitination and \ndegradation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Binding of ANXA1 to EphA2 \npromoted NPC cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo by elevating EphA2 \nlevels and increasing activity of EphA2 oncogenic signaling (pS897-EphA2). \nExpression of ANXA1 and EphA2 was positively correlated and both were \nsignificantly higher in NPC tissues than in the normal nasopharyngeal epithelial \ntissues. Patients with high expression of both proteins presented poorer \ndisease-free survival and overall survival relative to patients with high \nexpression of one protein alone. Furthermore, amino acid residues 20-30aa and \n28-30aa of the ANXA1 N-terminus bound EphA2. An 11 amino acid-long ANXA1-derived \npeptide (EYVQTVKSSKG) was developed on the basis of this N-terminal region, \nwhich disrupted the connection of ANXA1 with EphA2, successfully downregulating \nEphA2 expression and dramatically suppressing NPC cell oncogenicity in vitro and \nin mice. These findings suggest that ANXA1 promotes NPC growth and metastasis \nvia binding and stabilization of EphA2 and present a strategy for targeting \nEphA2 degradation and treating NPC with a peptide. This therapeutic strategy may \nalso be extended to other cancers with high expression of both proteins.",

            "TEXT": "Disrupting the TRIB3-SQSTM1 interaction reduces liver fibrosis by restoring \nautophagy and suppressing exosome-mediated HSC activation.\n\nImpaired macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic \nfibrosis. However, how aberrant autophagy promotes fibrosis is far from \nunderstood. Here, we aimed to define a previously unrevealed pro-fibrotic \nmechanism for the stress protein TRIB3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3)-mediated \nautophagy dysfunction. Human fibrotic liver tissues were obtained from patients \nwith cirrhosis who underwent an open surgical repair process. The functional \nimplications of TRIB3 were evaluated in mouse models of hepatic fibrosis induced \nby bile duct ligation (BDL) or thioacetamide (TAA) injection. Human fibrotic \nliver tissues expressed higher levels of TRIB3 and selective autophagic receptor \nSQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) than nonfibrotic tissues and the elevated expression \nof TRIB3 and SQSTM1 was positively correlated in the fibrotic tissues. Silencing \nTrib3 protected against experimentally induced hepatic fibrosis, accompanied by \nrestored autophagy activity in fibrotic liver tissues. Furthermore, TRIB3 \ninteracted with SQSTM1 and hindered its binding to MAP1LC3/LC3, which caused the \naccumulation of SQSTM1 aggregates and obstructed autophagic flux. The \nTRIB3-mediated autophagy impairment not only suppressed autophagic degradation \nof late endosomes but also promoted hepatocellular secretion of INHBA/Activin \nA-enriched exosomes which caused migration, proliferation and activation of \nhepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the effector cells of liver fibrosis. Disrupting \nthe TRIB3-SQSTM1 interaction with a specific helical peptide exerted potent \nprotective effects against hepatic fibrosis by restoring autophagic flux in \nhepatocytes and HSCs. Together, stress-elevated TRIB3 expression promotes \nhepatic fibrosis by interacting with SQSTM1 and interfering with its functions \nin liver-parenchymal cells and activating HSCs. Targeting this interaction is a \npromising strategy for treating fibroproliferative liver diseases.",

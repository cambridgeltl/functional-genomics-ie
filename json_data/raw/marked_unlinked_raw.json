Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel \npotent therapeutic drugs for GBM treatment. Here, we show that regorafenib, an \noral multi-kinase inhibitor, exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy over \ntemozolomide, the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for GBM treatment both in \nvitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, regorafenib directly stabilizes PSAT1 \n(phosphoserine aminotransferase 1), a critical enzyme for serine synthesis, to \ntrigger PRKAA-dependent autophagy initiation and inhibit RAB11A-mediated \nautophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in lethal autophagy arrest in GBM \ncells. Maintenance of PSAT1 at a high level is essential for regorafenib-induced \nGBM suppression. Together, our data provide novel mechanistic insights of \nregorafenib-induced autophagy arrest and suggest a new paradigm for effective \ntreatment of GBM.",

Accumulating evidence suggest that degeneration of axons is an \nearly event in the disease, involving destruction programs that are independent \nof the survival of the cell soma. Necroptosis, a programmed cell death process, \nis emerging as a mediator of neuronal loss in models of neurodegenerative \ndiseases. Here, we demonstrate activation of necroptosis in postmortem brain \ntissue from PD patients and in a toxin-based mouse model of the disease. \nInhibition of key components of the necroptotic pathway resulted in a \nsignificant delay of 6-hydroxydopamine-dependent axonal degeneration of \ndopaminergic and cortical neurons in vitro. Genetic ablation of necroptosis \nmediators MLKL and RIPK3, as well as pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 in \npreclinical models of PD, decreased dopaminergic neuron degeneration, improving \nmotor performance. Together, these findings suggest that axonal degeneration in \nPD is mediated by the necroptosis machinery, a process here referred to as \nnecroaxoptosis, a druggable pathway to target dopaminergic neuronal loss.",

Thus, non-invasive imaging of SMC apoptosis may be able to evaluate \nAA progress and risk stratification. SMCs were treated with hydrogen peroxide \n(H2O2; 200 μΜ) or culture medium as a control. Apoptosis was measured using flow \ncytometry and [99mTc]duramycin to detect the binding efficiency to apoptotic \nSMCs. C57/BL6 mice were administered angiotensin-II and beta-aminopropionitrile \n(BAPN) subcutaneously to establish an AA model, or saline for controls. Aortic \nspecimens underwent pathological evaluation and their aortic diameters were \nmeasured after 6 weeks. Micro-SPECT/CT scanning of [99mTc]duramycin and 18F-FDG \nPET detection were performed. SMCs treated with H2O2 showed more apoptosis \ncompared with the control group (67.2 ± 3.8% vs. 16.1 ± 0.6%, P < 0.01). The \nexperimental group showed a high rate of AA formation (70%) compared with no AA \nformation in the control group. The average aorta diameter was higher and \n[99mTc]duramycin uptake at the AA site was higher in the experimental group \ncompared with the control group. Compared with the normal aorta in the control \ngroup, AA in experiment group had more severe medial degeneration, elastic fiber \nreduction and fracture, and collagen degeneration. TUNEL staining verified the \nhigher apoptosis rate at the AA site in experiment group compared with the \ncontrol group (63.9 ± 3.7% in ascending AA, 66.4 ± 4.0% in thoracic AA, vs. \n3.5 ± 0.3% in normal aorta, P < 0.01). [99mTc]Duramycin may be an effective \nprobe to evaluate apoptosis in AA.",

            "TEXT": "Arsenic trioxide induces macrophage autophagy and atheroprotection by regulating \nROS-dependent TFEB nuclear translocation and AKT/mTOR pathway.\n\nInducing autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis may provide a therapeutic treatment \nfor atherosclerosis (AS). For the treatment of progressive AS, arsenic trioxide \n(ATO) has been used to coat vascular stents. However, the effect of ATO on \nautophagy of macrophages is still unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study \nwere to characterize the effects and the mechanism of actions of ATO on \nautophagy in macrophages. Our results showed that ATO-induced activation of \nautophagy was an earlier event than ATO-induced inhibition of the expression of \napoptosis markers in macrophages and foam cells. Nuclear transcription factor EB \n(TFEB) prevents atherosclerosis by activating macrophage autophagy and promoting \nlysosomal biogenesis. Here, we report that ATO triggered the nuclear \ntranslocation of TFEB, which in turn promoted autophagy and \nautophagosome-lysosome fusion. Both the latter events were prevented by TFEB \nknockdown. Moreover, ATO decreased the p-AKT and p-mTOR in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR \nsignaling pathway, thus inducing autophagy. Correspondingly, treatment with the \nautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) abolished the autophagy-inducing \neffects of ATO. Meanwhile, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and mTOR inhibitor \n(rapamycin) cooperated with ATO to induce autophagy. Furthermore, reactive \noxygen species (ROS) were generated in macrophages after treatment with ATO. The \nROS scavenger N-acetyl-1-cysteine (NAC) abolished ATO-induced nuclear \ntranslocation of TFEB, as well as changes in key molecules of the AKT/mTOR \nsignaling pathway and downstream autophagy. More importantly, ATO promoted \nautophagy in the aorta of ApoE-/- mice and reduced atherosclerotic lesions in \nearly AS, which were reversed by 3-MA treatment. In summary, our data indicated \nthat ATO promoted ROS induction, which resulted in nuclear translocation of TFEB \nand inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These actions ultimately promoted \nmacrophage autophagy and reduced atherosclerotic lesions at early stages. These \nfindings may provide a new perspective for the clinical treatment of early-stage \natherosclerosis and should be further studied.",

            "TEXT": "Cancer Cell-Derived Matrisome Proteins Promote Metastasis in Pancreatic Ductal \nAdenocarcinoma.\n\nThe prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor despite \ndecades of effort. The abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) in PDAC comprises a \nmajor fraction of the tumor mass and plays various roles in promoting resistance \nto therapies. However, nonselective depletion of ECM has led to poor patient \noutcomes. Consistent with that observation, we previously showed that individual \nmatrisome proteins derived from stromal cells correlate with either long or \nshort patient survival. In marked contrast, those derived from cancer cells \ncorrelate strongly with poor survival. Here, we studied three cancer \ncell-derived matrisome proteins that are significantly overrepresented during \nPDAC progression, AGRN (agrin), SERPINB5 (serine protease inhibitor B5), and \nCSTB (cystatin B). Using both overexpression and knockdown experiments, we \ndemonstrate that all three are promoters of PDAC metastasis. Furthermore, these \nproteins operate at different metastatic steps. AGRN promoted \nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in primary tumors, whereas SERPINB5 and \nCSTB enhanced late steps in the metastatic cascade by elevating invadopodia \nformation and in vivo extravasation. All three genes were associated with a poor \nprognosis in human patients and high levels of SERPINB5, secreted by cancer \ncells and deposited in the ECM, correlated with poor patient prognosis. This \nstudy provides strong evidence that cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins can \nbe causal in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis and lead to poor patient \nsurvival. Therefore, compared with the bulk matrix, mostly made by stromal \ncells, precise interventions targeting cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins, \nsuch as AGRN, SERPINB5, and CSTB, may represent preferred potential therapeutic \ntargets. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insights into the biological roles of \ncancer cell-derived matrisome proteins in PDAC and supports the notion that \nthese proteins are protumorigenic and better therapeutic targets.",

In \naddition to its role in mitochondrial membrane fusion, cristae structure, and \nbioenergetic function, OPA1 controls apoptosis by sequestering cytochrome c (cyt \nc) in mitochondrial cristae. Cleavage of functional long OPA1 (L-OPA1) isoforms \nby OMA1 inactivates mitochondrial fusion and primes apoptosis. OPA1 cleavage is \nregulated by the prohibitin (PHB) complex, a heteromeric, ring-shaped \nmitochondrial inner membrane scaffolding complex composed of PHB1 and PHB2. In \nneurons, PHB plays a protective role against various stresses, and PHB deletion \ndestabilizes OPA1 causing neurodegeneration. While deletion of OMA1 prevents \nOPA1 destabilization and attenuates neurodegeneration in PHB2 KO mice, how PHB \nlevels regulate OMA1 is still unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of \nmodulating neuronal PHB levels on OMA1 stability and OPA1 cleavage. We \ndemonstrate that PHB promotes OMA1 turnover, effectively decreasing the pool of \nOMA1. Further, we show that OMA1 binds to cardiolipin (CL), a major \nmitochondrial phospholipid. CL binding promotes OMA1 turnover, as we show that \ndeleting the CL-binding domain of OMA1 decreases its turnover rate. Since PHB is \nknown to stabilize CL, these data suggest that PHB modulates OMA1 through CL. \nFurthermore, we show that PHB decreases cyt c release induced by tBID and \nattenuates caspase 9 activation in response to hypoxic stress in neurons. Taken \ntogether, our results suggest that PHB-mediated CL stabilization regulates \nstress responses and cell death through OMA1 turnover and cyt c release.",

            "TEXT": "Rosuvastatin protects against coronary microembolization-induced cardiac injury \nvia inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n\nCoronary microembolization (CME), a common reason for periprocedural myocardial \ninfarction (PMI), bears very important prognostic implications. However, the \nmolecular mechanisms related to CME remain largely elusive. Statins have been \nshown to prevent PMI, but the underlying mechanism has not been identified. \nHere, we examine whether the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to CME-induced \ncardiac injury and investigate the effects of statin therapy on CME. In vivo \nstudy, mice with CME were treated with 40 mg/kg/d rosuvastatin (RVS) orally or a \nselective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg/d). \nMice treated with MCC950 and RVS showed improved cardiac contractile function \nand morphological changes, diminished fibrosis and microinfarct size, and \nreduced serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Mechanistically, RVS decreased \nthe expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin-1β, and Gasdermin D N-terminal \ndomains. Proteomics analysis revealed that RVS restored the energy metabolism \nand oxidative phosphorylation in CME. Furthermore, reduced reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) level and alleviated mitochondrial damage were observed in \nRVS-treated mice. In vitro study, RVS inhibited the activation of NLRP3 \ninflammasome induced by tumor necrosis factor α plus hypoxia in H9c2 cells. \nMeanwhile, the pyroptosis was also suppressed by RVS, indicated by the increased \ncell viability, decreased LDH and propidium iodide uptake in H9c2 cells. RVS \nalso reduced the level of mitochondrial ROS generation in vitro. Our results \nindicate the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent cardiac pyroptosis plays an important \nrole in CME-induced cardiac injury and its inhibitor exerts cardioprotective \neffect following CME. We also uncover the anti-pyroptosis role of RVS in CME, \nwhich is associated with regulating mitochondrial ROS.",

It \nplays a major role during normal development, differentiation, and disease \nprogression. The modification is regulated by a set of writer, eraser, and \nreader proteins. The YTH domain family of proteins consists of three homologous \nm6A-binding proteins, Ythdf1, Ythdf2, and Ythdf3, which were suggested to have \ndifferent cellular functions. However, their sequence similarity and their \ntendency to bind the same targets suggest that they may have overlapping roles. \nWe systematically knocked out (KO) the Mettl3 writer, each of the Ythdf readers, \nand the three readers together (triple-KO). We then estimated the effect in vivo \nin mouse gametogenesis, postnatal viability, and in vitro in mouse embryonic \nstem cells (mESCs). In gametogenesis, Mettl3-KO severity is increased as the \ndeletion occurs earlier in the process, and Ythdf2 has a dominant role that \ncannot be compensated by Ythdf1 or Ythdf3, due to differences in readers' \nexpression pattern across different cell types, both in quantity and in spatial \nlocation. Knocking out the three readers together and systematically testing \nviable offspring genotypes revealed a redundancy in the readers' role during \nearly development that is Ythdf1/2/3 gene dosage-dependent. Finally, in mESCs \nthere is compensation between the three Ythdf reader proteins, since the \nresistance to differentiate and the significant effect on mRNA decay occur only \nin the triple-KO cells and not in the single KOs. Thus, we suggest a new model \nfor the Ythdf readers function, in which there is profound dosage-dependent \nredundancy when all three readers are equivalently coexpressed in the same cell \ntypes.",

Specifically, blocking GPX4 or SLC7a11 dramatically \nreduces Plasmodium liver stage parasite infection. In contrast, blocking \nnegative regulators of this pathway, NOX1 and TFR1, leads to an increase in \nliver stage infection. We have shown previously that increased levels of P53 \nreduces Plasmodium LS burden in an apoptosis-independent manner.

Here we show that this inflammation is driven by the \ncytoplasmic DNA sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) \nwhen TDP-43 invades mitochondria and releases DNA via the permeability \ntransition pore. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic deletion of cGAS and its \ndownstream signaling partner STING prevents upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN \ninduced by TDP-43 in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons \nand in TDP-43 mutant mice. Finally, we document elevated levels of the specific \ncGAS signaling metabolite cGAMP in spinal cord samples from patients, which may \nbe a biomarker of mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation in ALS. Our results \nidentify mtDNA release and cGAS/STING activation as critical determinants of \nTDP-43-associated pathology and demonstrate the potential for targeting this \npathway in ALS.",

The underlying mechanisms of this resistance remain obscure. \nIn this work, we showed that a CD44high state due to aberrant isoform splicing \nwas acquired from adaptive resistance to a PI3Kα inhibitor (BLY719) in luminal \nBrCas.

The exact role of \nepigenetic modification in acute liver injury remains elusive. Here, we \ninvestigated the role of histone methyltransferase G9a in LPS- or APAP \noverdose-induced acute liver injury. Under D-galactosamine sensitization, \nliver-specific G9a-deficient mice (L-G9a-/-) exhibited 100% mortality after LPS \ninjection, while the control and L-G9a+/- littermates showed very mild \nmortality. Moreover, abrogation of hepatic G9a or inhibiting the \nmethyltransferase activity of G9a aggravated LPS-induced liver damage. \nSimilarly, under sublethal APAP overdose, L-G9a-/- mice displayed more severe \nliver injury. Mechanistically, ablation of G9a inhibited H3K9me1 levels at the \npromoters of Gstp1/2, two liver detoxifying enzymes, and consequently suppressed \ntheir transcription. Notably, treating L-G9a-/- mice with recombinant mouse \nGSTP1 reversed the LPS- or APAP overdose-induced liver damage. Taken together, \nwe identify a novel beneficial role of G9a-GSTP1 axis in protecting against \nacute liver injury.",

Conditional autophagy deficiency in adult mice causes \nliver damage, shortens life span to 3 mo due to neurodegeneration, and is lethal \nupon fasting. As autophagy deficiency causes p53 induction and cell death in \nneurons, we sought to test whether p53 mediates the lethal consequences of \nautophagy deficiency. Here, we conditionally deleted Trp53 (p53 hereafter) \nand/or the essential autophagy gene Atg7 throughout adult mice. Compared with \nAtg7 Δ/Δ mice, the life span of Atg7 Δ/Δ p53 Δ/Δ mice was extended due to \ndelayed neurodegeneration and resistance to death upon fasting. Atg7 also \nsuppressed apoptosis induced by p53 activator Nutlin-3, suggesting that \nautophagy inhibited p53 activation. To test whether increased oxidative stress \nin Atg7 Δ/Δ mice was responsible for p53 activation, Atg7 was deleted in the \npresence or absence of the master regulator of antioxidant defense nuclear \nfactor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Nrf2-/-Atg7 Δ/Δ mice died rapidly \ndue to small intestine damage, which was not rescued by p53 codeletion. Thus, \nAtg7 limits p53 activation and p53-mediated neurodegeneration. In turn, NRF2 \nmitigates lethal intestine degeneration upon autophagy loss. These findings \nillustrate the tissue-specific roles for autophagy and functional dependencies \non the p53 and NRF2 stress response mechanisms.",

Mechanically, this effect relies on \nzalcitabine-induced mitochondrial DNA stress, which activates the \nSTING1/TMEM173-mediated DNA sensing pathway, leading to \nmacroautophagy/autophagy-dependent ferroptotic cell death via lipid \nperoxidation, but not a type I interferon response. Consequently, the genetic \nand pharmacological inactivation of the autophagy-dependent ferroptosis pathway \ndiminishes the anticancer effects of zalcitabine in cell culture and animal \nmodels. Together, these findings not only provide a new approach for pancreatic \ncancer therapy but also increase our understanding of the interplay between \nautophagy and DNA damage response in shaping cell death.",

Moreover, CSN5 modulated the \ndeubiquitination and stability of PD-L1. High expression of CSN5 in CRC was \nassociated with significantly shorter survival.

Therefore, reducing accumulated iron and associated \noxidative stress is considered a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. However, \ncurrent iron chelators have poor membrane permeability and lack cell-type \nspecificity. Here we identified GSK-J4, a histone demethylase inhibitor with the \nability to cross blood brain barrier, as a potent iron suppressor. Only a trace \namount of GSK-J4 significantly and selectively reduced intracellular labile iron \nin dopaminergic neurons, and suppressed H2O2 and 6-OHDA-induced cell death in \nvitro. The iron-suppressive effect was mainly mediated by inducing an increase \nin the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin-1. In parallel, GSK-J4 \nrescued dopaminergic neuron loss and motor defects in 6-OHDA-induced PD rats, \nwhich was accompanied by reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly, GSK-J4 \nrescued the abnormal changes of histone methylation, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 during \n6-OHDA treatment although the iron-suppressive and neuroprotective effects were \nsensitive to H3K4me3 inhibition only. Also, upregulating H3K4me3 increased \nferroportin-1 expression and neuroprotection. Taken together, we demonstrate a \npreviously unappreciated action of GSK-J4 on cell-specific iron suppression and \nneuroprotection via epigenetic mechanism. Compared with conventional iron \nchelators, this compound has a stronger therapeutic potential for PD.",

Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR \nscreening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) \nPOU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful \ndependency in a subset of SCLC lines.

Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling \nexperiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell \nidentity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can \nbe classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, \nASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique dependencies in \nPOU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the \nreceptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor).

The PARP inhibitor olaparib is a \nmolecularly targeted drug that continues to be investigated in BRCA-mutated \ntumors. However, in tumors without BRCA gene mutations, particularly in STAD, \nthe effect and molecular mechanism of olaparib are unclear, which largely \nrestricts the use of olaparib in STAD treatment. In this study, the in vitro \nresults showed that olaparib specifically inhibited cell growth and migration, \nexerting antitumor effect in STAD cell lines. In addition, a ClC-3/SGK1 \nregulatory axis was identified and validated in STAD cells. We then found that \nthe down-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis attenuated olaparib-induced cell growth \nand migration inhibition. On the contrary, the up-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis \nenhanced olaparib-induced cell growth and migration inhibition, and the \nenhancement effect could be attenuated by SGK1 knockdown. Consistently, the \nwhole-cell recorded chloride current activated by olaparib presented the same \nvariation trend. Next, the clinical data showed that ClC-3 and SGK1 were highly \nexpressed in human STAD tissues and positively correlated (r = 0.276, \nP = 0.009). Furthermore, high protein expression of both ClC-3 (P = 0.030) and \nSGK1 (P = 0.006) was associated with poor survival rate in STAD patients, and \npositive correlations between ClC-3/SGK1 and their downstream molecules in STAD \ntissues were demonstrated via the GEPIA datasets. Finally, our results suggested \nthat olaparib inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in STAD cells, and up-regulation of \nClC-3/SGK1 axis enhanced olaparib-induced PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. The \nanimal experiments indicated that olaparib also exerted antitumor effect in \nvivo. Altogether, our findings illustrate that olaparib exerts antitumor effect \nin human STAD, and ClC-3/SGK1 regulatory axis enhances the olaparib-induced \nantitumor effect. Up-regulation of the ClC-3/SGK1 axis may provide promising \ntherapeutic potential for the clinical application of olaparib in STAD \ntreatment.",

Both enzymes induced caspase cleavage and \nactivation, chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine exposure, indicating \napoptosis. Both arginase- and asparaginase-induced death were blocked by caspase \ninhibitors, but with different sensitivities.

In diabetic \nwound, which is characterized by delayed healing process, excessive apoptosis is \ndocumented and plays a crucial role. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which is \nelevated in non-healed diabetic wound, is necessary for healing process but its \nabnormality resulted in a delayed healing. The classical function of MMP9 is the \ndegradation of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, there is some literature \nevidence that MMP9 triggers cell apoptosis. Whether the excessive MMP9 \ncontributes to epidermis cell apoptosis in delayed healing diabetic wound and \nthe underlying mechanisms is not clear. In this study, we aimed to explore \nwhether MMP9 induced keratinocyte apoptosis and investigate the plausible \nmechanisms. Our in vitro study showed that advanced glycation end products \n(AGEs) induced keratinocyte apoptosis and enhanced MMP9 level. Besides, MMP9, \nboth intra-cellular expressions and extra-cellular supplement, promoted cell \napoptosis. Further, MMP9 resulted in an increased expression of FasL, other than \nFas and p53. These findings identified a novel effect that MMP9 exerted in \ndelayed diabetic wound healing, owing to a pro-apoptotic effect on keratinocyte, \nwhich was mediated by an increase of FasL expression. This study increases \nunderstanding of elevated MMP9 which is involved in diabetic wound repair and \noffers some insights into novel future therapies.",

Recent evidence demonstrates that \nsenescent cells, while initially restricting tumorigenesis, can induce tumor \nprogression. Here, we identify the metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP1 as a \nmolecular switch that determines the effects of senescence in prostate cancer. \nSenescence driven either by PTEN deficiency or chemotherapy limits the \nprogression of prostate cancer in mice. TIMP1 deletion allows senescence to \npromote metastasis, and elimination of senescent cells with a senolytic BCL-2 \ninhibitor impairs metastasis. Mechanistically, TIMP1 loss reprograms the \nsenescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent tumor cells \nthrough activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Loss of PTEN and TIMP1 \nin prostate cancer is frequent and correlates with resistance to docetaxel and \nworst clinical outcomes in patients treated in an adjuvant setting. Altogether, \nthese findings provide insights into the dual roles of tumor-associated \nsenescence and can potentially impact the treatment of prostate cancer.",

Deleterious effects of MAO-A/4-HNE on cardiac \ndysfunction were prevented by activation of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase \n2 (ALDH2), the main enzyme for 4-HNE metabolism. Mechanistically, MAO-A-derived \n4-HNE bound to newly identified targets VDAC and MCU to promote ER-mitochondria \ncontact sites and MCU higher-order complex formation. The resulting \nmitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation participated in mitochondrial respiratory \ndysfunction and loss of membrane potential, as shown with the protective effects \nof the MCU inhibitor, RU360. Most interestingly, these findings were \nrecapitulated in a chronic model of ischemic remodeling where pharmacological or \ngenetic inhibition of MAO-A protected the mice from 4-HNE accumulation, MCU \noligomer formation and Ca2+ overload, thus mitigating ventricular dysfunction. \nTo our knowledge, these are the first evidences linking MAO-A activation to \nmitoCa2+ mishandling through local 4-HNE production, contributing to energetic \nfailure and postischemic remodeling.",

Addition of the \nAChE inhibitors neostigmine and territrem B reduced apoptotic cell death under \nnormal culture conditions. Moreover, both inhibitors completely suppressed \nhypoxia-induced neuronal cell death. Exposure of live animals to severe hypoxia \nmoderately increased the expression of ace-1 in locust brains in vivo. Our \nresults indicate a previously unreported role of AChE in insect apoptosis that \nparallels the pro-apoptotic role in mammalian cells.

Inflammasomes are thought to be especially \nrelevant to immune homeostasis, and their dysregulation contributes to \ninflammation and NDDs. However, few agents have been clinically shown to reduce \nNDD incidence by targeting inflammasomes. Our study indicated that NLRP3 (NLR \nfamily, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome is involved in Parkinson disease \n(PD) progression in patients and various murine models. In addition, the small \nmolecule kaempferol (Ka) protected mice against LPS- and SNCA-induced \nneurodegeneration by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by \nthe fact that Ka reduced cleaved CASP1 expression and disrupted \nNLRP3-PYCARD-CASP1 complex assembly with concomitant decreased IL1B secretion. \nMechanically, Ka promoted macroautophagy/autophagy in microglia, leading to \nreduced NLRP3 protein expression, which in turn deactivated the NLRP3 \ninflammasome. Intriguingly, ubiquitination was involved in Ka-induced autophagic \nNLRP3 degradation. These findings were further confirmed in vivo as knockdown of \nAtg5 expression or autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly inhibited the \nKa-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and neurodegeneration amelioration. \nThus, we demonstrated that Ka promotes neuroinflammatory inhibition via the \ncooperation of ubiquitination and autophagy, suggesting that Ka is a promising \ntherapeutic strategy for the treatment of NDDs.",

Previous studies suggested that PDK4 is \nincreased in the calcified vessels of patients with atherosclerosis and is \nclosely associated with mitochondrial function, but the precise regulatory \nmechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the role of \nPDK4 in vascular calcification and the molecular mechanisms involved. Using a \nvariety of complementary techniques, we found impaired autophagic activity in \nthe process of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcification, whereas \nknocking down PDK4 had the opposite effect. PDK4 drives the metabolic \nreprogramming of VSMCs towards a Warburg effect, and the inhibition of PDK4 \nabrogates VSMCs calcification. Mechanistically, PDK4 disturbs the integrity of \nthe mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane, concomitantly \nimpairing mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which contributes to a decrease in \nlysosomal degradation by inhibiting the V-ATPase and lactate dehydrogenase B \ninteraction. PDK4 also inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription \nfactor EB, thus inhibiting lysosomal function. These changes result in the \ninterruption of autophagic flux, which accelerates calcium deposition in VSMCs. \nIn addition, glycolysis serves as a metabolic adaptation to improve VSMCs \noxidative stress resistance, whereas inhibition of glycolysis by \n2-deoxy-D-glucose induces the apoptosis of VSMCs and increases the calcium \ndeposition in VSMCs. Our results suggest that PDK4 plays a key role in vascular \ncalcification through autophagy inhibition and metabolic reprogramming.",

TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB)-mediated induction of ALP has been recently considered as the common \nmechanism in ameliorating the pathological lesion of myocardial ischemia and \nneurodegenerative diseases. Here we explored the vital role of TFEB in permanent \nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)-mediated dysfunction of ALP and \nischemic insult in rats. The results showed that ALP function was first enhanced \nin the early stage of the ischemic process, especially in neurons of the cortex, \nand this was accompanied by increased TFEB expression and translocation to the \nnucleus, which was mediated at least in part through activation by \nPPP3/calcineurin. At the later stages of ischemia, a gradual decrease in the \nlevel of nuclear TFEB was coupled with a progressive decline in lysosomal \nactivity, accumulation of autophagosomes and autophagy substrates, and \nexacerbation of the ischemic injury. Notably, neuron-specific overexpression of \nTFEB significantly enhanced ALP function and rescued the ischemic damage, \nstarting as early as 6 h and even lasting to 48 h after ischemia. Furthermore, \nneuron-specific knockdown of TFEB markedly reversed the activation of ALP and \nfurther aggravated the neurological deficits and ischemic outcome at the early \nstage of pMCAO. These results highlight neuronal-targeted TFEB as one of the key \nplayers in the pMCAO-mediated dysfunction of ALP and ischemic injury, and \nidentify TFEB as a promising target for therapies aimed at neuroprotection in \ncerebral ischemia.",

Particularly, five-year overall survival for high-risk neuroblastoma is \nbelow 50% with no curative options when refractory or relapsed. Most of current \ntherapies target cell division and proliferation, thereby inducing DNA damage \nand programmed cell death. However, aggressive tumours often present alterations \nof these processes and are resistant to therapy. Therefore, exploring \nalternative pathways to induce tumour cell death will provide new therapeutic \nopportunities for these patients. In this study we aimed at testing the \ntherapeutic potential of ABTL0812, a novel anticancer drug that induces \ncytotoxic autophagy to eliminate cancer cells, which is currently in phase II \nclinical trials of adult tumours. Here, we show that ABTL0812 impaired the \nviability of clinical representative neuroblastoma cell lines regardless of \ngenetic alterations associated to bad prognosis and resistance to therapy.

Host cell \nfactor-1 (HCF-1) is a transcriptional co-regulator that is essential for and has \nbeen implicated in basic cellular processes, such as transcriptional regulation \nand cell cycle progression. Although a series of HCF-1 transcriptional targets \nhave been identified, few functional clues have been provided, especially for \nchromosome segregation. Our results showed that HCF-1 activated CDC42 expression \nby binding to the -881 to -575 region upstream of the CDC42 transcription start \nsite, and the regulation of CDC42 expression by HCF-1 was correlated with cell \ncycle progression. The overexpression of a spontaneously cycling and \nconstitutively active CDC42 mutant (CDC42F28L) rescued G1 phase delay and \nmultinucleate defects in mitosis upon the loss of HCF-1.

Western blot analysis with \nan antibody to γH2AX showed that DS00329 induced DNA damage and flow cytometry \nand western blotting confirmed that it triggered a G1 cell cycle arrest which \ncorrelated with decreased levels in Cyclin A, Cyclin B, Cyclin D1 and cyclin \ndependent kinase 2 and an increase in levels of the cyclin dependent kinase \ninhibitor p21. DS00329 treated glioblastoma cells exhibited morphological and \nmolecular markers typical of apoptotic cells such as membrane blebbing and cell \nshrinkage and an increase in levels of cleaved PARP. Flow cytometry with annexin \nV-FITC/propidium iodide staining confirmed that DS00329 induced apoptotic cell \ndeath in glioblastoma cells. We also show that DS00329 treatment of glioblastoma \ncells led to an increase in the autophagosome marker LC3-II and autophagy \ninhibition studies using bafilomycin A1 and wortmannin, showed that \nDS00329-induced-autophagy was a pro-death mechanism. Furthermore, DS00329 \ntreatment of glioblastoma cells inhibited the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt \ncell survival pathway. Our findings suggest that DS00329 may be an effective \ntreatment for glioblastoma and provide a rationale for further exploration and \nvalidation of the use of phenothiazines and their derivatives in the treatment \nof glioblastoma.",

            "TEXT": "TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) activation suppresses autophagy through inhibition \nof FOXO3 and impairs phagocytic capacity of microglia.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a lysosome-dependent catabolic process for the \nturnover of proteins and organelles in eukaryotes. Autophagy plays an important \nrole in immunity and inflammation, as well as metabolism and cell survival. \nDiverse immune and inflammatory signals induce autophagy in macrophages through \npattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, the \nphysiological role of autophagy and its signaling mechanisms in microglia remain \npoorly understood. Microglia are phagocytic immune cells that are resident in \nthe central nervous system and share many characteristics with macrophages. \nHere, we show that autophagic flux and expression of autophagy-related (Atg) \ngenes in microglia are significantly suppressed upon TLR4 activation by \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS), in contrast to their stimulation by LPS in \nmacrophages. Metabolomics analysis of the levels of phosphatidylinositol \n(PtdIns) and its 3-phosphorylated form, PtdIns3P, in combination with \nbioinformatics prediction, revealed an LPS-induced reduction in the synthesis of \nPtdIns and PtdIns3P in microglia but not macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition \nof PI3K, but not MTOR or MAPK1/3, restored autophagic flux with concomitant \ndephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3. A constitutively active \nform of FOXO3 also induced autophagy, suggesting FOXO3 as a downstream target of \nthe PI3K pathway for autophagy inhibition. LPS treatment impaired phagocytic \ncapacity of microglia, including MAP1LC3B/LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and \namyloid β (Aβ) clearance. PI3K inhibition restored LAP and degradation capacity \nof microglia against Aβ. These findings suggest a unique mechanism for the \nregulation of microglial autophagy and point to the PI3K-FOXO3 pathway as a \npotential therapeutic target to regulate microglial function in brain disorders.",

It also has a prominent role \nin modulating aging. However, the role of autophagy in the neuronal response to \naxon injury and axon regeneration, particularly in the context of aging, remains \nlargely unknown. Our candidate genetic screen for axon regeneration regulators \nhas identified genes in the autophagy pathway. Using a reporter that monitors \nautophagosomes and autolysosomes, we were able to monitor the dynamics of \nautophagy during axon regeneration. In response to axon injury, there was a \nsignificant increase in the number of autophagic vesicles. Injury-triggered \nautophagy activation and axon regeneration capacity undergo an age-dependent \ndecline, and autophagy-activating agents partially rescued these declines. We \nfound that DLK-1 was both required and sufficient for injury-induced autophagy \nactivation. Autophagic vesicles co-localized with the NOTCH4 ortholog, LIN-12 \nreceptor, a previously identified inhibitor of axon regeneration. Epistasis \nanalyses indicate that LIN-12 might be a target of autophagy in axon \nregeneration. Together, our data suggest that DLK-mediated injury signaling can \nactivate autophagy, which might limit the level of LIN-12 and NOTCH proteins to \npromote axon regeneration. Our findings reveal that autophagy activation can \npromote axon regeneration in neurons that lack maximal regrowth capacity, \nproviding a promising therapeutic strategy for axon injury.",

However, the underlying \nmolecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that RAB2 connects the Golgi \nnetwork to autophagy pathway by delivering membrane and by sequentially engaging \ndistinct autophagy machineries. In unstressed cells, RAB2 resides primarily in \nthe Golgi apparatus, as evidenced by its interaction and colocalization with \nGOLGA2/GM130. Importantly, autophagy stimuli dissociate RAB2 from GOLGA2 to \ninteract with ULK1 complex, which facilitates the recruitment of ULK1 complex to \nform phagophores. Intriguingly, RAB2 appears to modulate ULK1 kinase activity to \npropagate signals for autophagosome formation. Subsequently, RAB2 switches to \ninteract with autophagosomal RUBCNL/PACER and STX17 to further specify the \nrecruitment of HOPS complex for autolysosome formation. Together, our study \nreveals a multivalent pathway in bulk autophagy regulation, and provides \nmechanistic insights into how the Golgi apparatus contributes to the formation \nof different autophagic structures.",

This study evaluated the effect of \nClotam (tolfenamic acid or TA), a small molecule and inhibitor of Specificity \nprotein1 (Sp1) and survivin for sensitizing ES cell lines to chemotherapeutic \nagent, vincristine (VCR).

The apoptosis markers, caspase 3/7 (activity levels) and \ncleaved-PARP (protein expression) were measured. Cardiomyocytes, H9C2 were used \nas non-malignant cells. While, all treatments caused time- and dose-dependent \ninhibition of cell viability, interestingly, combination treatment caused \nsignificantly higher response (~ 80% inhibition, p < 0.05). Cell viability \ninhibition was accompanied by inhibition of Sp1 and Survivin. TA + VCR treatment \nsignificantly (p < 0.05) increased caspase 3/7 activity which strongly \ncorrelated with upregulated c-PARP level and Annexin V staining. Cell cycle \narrest was observed at G0/G1 (TA) or G2/M (VCR and TA + VCR). All treatments did \nnot cause cytotoxicity in H9C2 cells. These results suggest that TA could \nenhance the anti-cancer activity of VCR in ES cells. Therefore, TA + VCR \ncombination could be further tested to develop as safe/effective therapeutic \nstrategy for treating ES.",

Consistent with suggestions that lifetime stress may be \nan important AD precipitating factor, we previously reported that environmental \nstress and high glucocorticoid (GC) levels induce accumulation of aggregated \nTau; however, the molecular mechanisms for such process remain unclear. Herein, \nwe monitor a novel interplay between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and autophagic \nmachinery in the underlying mechanisms through which chronic stress and high GC \nlevels impact on Tau proteostasis precipitating Tau aggregation. Using \nmolecular, pharmacological and behavioral analysis, we demonstrate that chronic \nstress and high GC trigger mTOR-dependent inhibition of autophagy, leading to \naccumulation of Tau aggregates and cell death in P301L-Tau expressing mice and \ncells. In parallel, we found that environmental stress and GC disturb cellular \nhomeostasis and trigger the insoluble accumulation of different RBPs, such as \nPABP, G3BP1, TIA-1, and FUS, shown to form stress granules (SGs) and Tau \naggregation. Interestingly, an mTOR-driven pharmacological stimulation of \nautophagy attenuates the GC-driven accumulation of Tau and SG-related proteins \nas well as the related cell death, suggesting a critical interface between \nautophagy and the response of the SG-related protein in the neurodegenerative \npotential of chronic stress and GC.

Here we demonstrate that a nuclear lncRNA \nLINC00336 is upregulated in lung cancer and functions as an oncogene by acting \nas a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs). LINC00336 bound RNA-binding protein \nELAVL1 (ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1) using nucleotides 1901-2107 of \nLINC00336 and the RRM interaction domain and key amino acids (aa) of ELAVL1 (aa \n101-213), inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, ELAVL1 increased LINC00336 \nexpression by stabilizing its posttranscriptional level, whereas LSH \n(lymphoid-specific helicase) increased ELAVL1 expression through the p53 \nsignaling pathway, further supporting the hypothesis that LSH promotes LINC00336 \nexpression. Interestingly, LINC00336 served as an endogenous sponge of microRNA \n6852 (MIR6852) to regulate the expression of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), a \nsurrogate marker of ferroptosis. Finally, we found that MIR6852 inhibited cell \ngrowth by promoting ferroptosis. These data show that the network of lncRNA and \nceRNA has an important role in tumorigenesis and ferroptosis.",

Rat NP cells underwent \nvarious periods of 1.0 MPa compression. To determine whether compression \naffected mitochondrial function, we evaluated the mitochondrial membrane \npotential, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), mitochondrial \nultrastructure and ATP content. Oxidative stress-related indicators reactive \noxygen species, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde were also assessed. To \nverify the relevance between oxidative stress and necroptosis together with \napoptosis, RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1(Nec-1), mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A \n(CsA), antioxidants and small interfering RNA technology were utilized. The \nresults established that compression elicited a time-dependent mitochondrial \ndysfunction and elevated oxidative stress. Nec-1 and CsA restored mitochondrial \nfunction and reduced oxidative stress, which corresponded to decreased \nnecroptosis and apoptosis. CsA down-regulated mitochondrial cyclophilin D \nexpression, but had little effects on RIPK1 expression and pRIPK1 activation. \nAdditionally, we found that Nec-1 largely blocked apoptosis; whereas, the \napoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK increased RIPK1 expression and pRIPK1 activation, \nand coordinated regulation of necroptosis and apoptosis enabled NP cells \nsurvival more efficiently. In contrast to Nec-1, SiRIPK1 exacerbated \nmitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In summary, RIPK1-mediated \nmitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a crucial role in NP cells \nnecroptosis and apoptosis during compression injury. The synergistic regulation \nof necroptosis and apoptosis may exert more beneficial effects on NP cells \nsurvival, and ultimately delaying or even retarding intervertebral disc \ndegeneration.",

Here, we examine the preclinical \nprofile of futibatinib (TAS-120; \n1-[(3S)-[4-amino-3-[(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl]-1H-pyrazolo[3, 4-d] \npyrimidin-1-yl]-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-propen-1-one), a structurally novel, \nirreversible FGFR1-4 inhibitor. Among a panel of 296 human kinases, futibatinib \nselectively inhibited FGFR1-4 with IC50 values of 1.4 to 3.7 nmol/L. Futibatinib \ncovalently bound the FGFR kinase domain, inhibiting FGFR phosphorylation and, in \nturn, downstream signaling in FGFR-deregulated tumor cell lines. Futibatinib \nexhibited potent, selective growth inhibition of several tumor cell lines \n(gastric, lung, multiple myeloma, bladder, endometrial, and breast) harboring \nvarious FGFR genomic aberrations. Oral administration of futibatinib led to \nsignificant dose-dependent tumor reduction in various FGFR-driven human tumor \nxenograft models, and tumor reduction was associated with sustained FGFR \ninhibition, which was proportional to the administered dose. The frequency of \nappearance of drug-resistant clones was lower with futibatinib than a reversible \nATP-competitive FGFR inhibitor, and futibatinib inhibited several drug-resistant \nFGFR2 mutants, including the FGFR2 V565I/L gatekeeper mutants, with greater \npotency than any reversible FGFR inhibitors tested (IC50, 1.3-50.6 nmol/L). \nThese results indicate that futibatinib is a novel orally available, potent, \nselective, and irreversible inhibitor of FGFR1-4 with a broad spectrum of \nantitumor activity in cell lines and xenograft models. These findings provide a \nstrong rationale for testing futibatinib in patients with tumors oncogenically \ndriven by FGFR genomic aberrations, with phase I to III trials ongoing. \nSIGNIFICANCE: Preclinical characterization of futibatinib, an irreversible \nFGFR1-4 inhibitor, demonstrates selective and potent antitumor activity against \nFGFR-deregulated cancer cell lines and xenograft models, supporting clinical \nevaluation in patients with FGFR-driven tumors.",

The RT uses the ncRNA as template, generating a \nchimeric RNA/DNA molecule in which the RNA and DNA components are covalently \nlinked. Although retrons were discovered three decades ago, their function \nremained unknown. We report that retrons function as anti-phage defense systems. \nThe defensive unit is composed of three components: the RT, the ncRNA, and an \neffector protein. We examined multiple retron systems and show that they confer \ndefense against a broad range of phages via abortive infection. Focusing on \nretron Ec48, we show evidence that it \"guards\" RecBCD, a complex with central \nanti-phage functions in bacteria. Inhibition of RecBCD by phage proteins \nactivates the retron, leading to abortive infection and cell death. Thus, the \nEc48 retron forms a second line of defense that is triggered if the first lines \nof defense have collapsed.",

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms \nunderlying the role of ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) in the \nregulation of SG dynamics remain elusive.

The domain of unknown function (DUF) of \nUBAP2L-mediated interaction with ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein \n(G3BP)1/2, and its deletion caused the cytoplasmic-nuclear transport of UBAP2L \nand G3BP1/2, thereby compromising SG formation. The protein arginine \nmethyltransferase PRMT1 asymmetrically dimethylated UBAP2L by targeting the RGG \nmotif. Increased arginine methylation blocked, whereas its decrease enhanced \nUBAP2L interactions with SG components, ablating and promoting SG assembly, \nrespectively.

Responses to genotoxic \nchemotherapy in the adjuvant or palliative setting vary greatly between \npatients, and colorectal cancer cells often resist chemotherapy by evading \napoptosis. Antagonists of an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can restore \ndefective apoptosis signaling by degrading cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins and by \ninhibition of XIAP. Due to the multiple molecular mechanisms-of-action of these \ntargets, responses to IAP antagonist may differ between molecularly distinct \ncolon cancer cells. In this study, responses to the IAP antagonist Birinapant \nand oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated in 14 colon cancer cell \nlines, representing the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). Treatment with \nBirinapant alone did not result in a substantial increase in apoptotic cells in \nthis cell line panel. Annexin-V/PI assays quantified by flow cytometry and \nhigh-content screening showed that Birinapant increased responses of CMS1 and \npartially CMS3 cell lines to oxaliplatin/5-FU, whereas CMS2 cells were not \neffectively sensitized. FRET-based imaging of caspase-8 and -3 activation \nvalidated these differences at the single-cell level, with CMS1 cells displaying \nsustained activation of caspase-8-like activity during Birinapant and \noxaliplatin/5-FU co-treatment, ultimately activating the intrinsic mitochondrial \napoptosis pathway. In CMS2 cell lines, Birinapant exhibited synergistic effects \nin combination with TNFα, suggesting that Birinapant can restore extrinsic \napoptosis signaling in the context of inflammatory signals in this subtype. To \nexplore this further, we co-cultured CMS2 and CMS1 colon cancer cells with \nperipheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed increased cell death during \nBirinapant single treatment in these co-cultures, which was abrogated by \nanti-TNFα-neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, our study demonstrates that IAP \ninhibition is a promising modulator of response to oxaliplatin/5-FU in \ncolorectal cancers of the CMS1 subtype, and may show promise as in the CMS2 \nsubtype, suggesting that molecular subtyping may aid as a patient stratification \ntool for IAP antagonists in this disease.",

            "TEXT": "The deubiquitinase USP10 regulates KLF4 stability and suppresses lung \ntumorigenesis.\n\nKrüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a key transcription factor, acts as a \nmultifunctional player involved in the progression of numerous aggressive \ncancers. The proteasome-dependent pathway is one of the main modalities in \ncontrolling KLF4 abundance at a posttranslational level. Although some of the \nubiquitin ligases have been identified, the deubiquitinases of KLF4 and the \nregulatory function remain unexplored. Here, by screening ubiquitin-specific \nproteases that may interact with KLF4, we found ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 \n(USP10) as a deubiquitinating enzyme for KLF4. Forced expression of USP10 \nremarkably increases KLF4 protein level by blocking the latter degradation, \nwhereas the depletion of USP10 promotes KLF4 degradation and thus enhances \ntumorigenesis. Loss of USP10 in mice downregulates KLF4 expression and \naccelerates KrasG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma initiation and progression. In \naddition, our data revealed that KLF4 can facilitate the transcription of tumor \nsuppressor TIMP3 by directly binding to the TIMP3 promoter. Clinically, \nreduction of USP10 expression, concomitant with decreased KLF4 and TIMP3 \nabundance in carcinoma tissue, predicts poor prognosis of lung cancer patient. \nTaken together, our results demonstrate that USP10 is a critical regulator of \nKLF4, pinpointing USP10-KLF4-TIMP3 axis as a promising therapeutic target in \nlung cancer.",

Mechanistically, depletion of Snf2h results in \ndysregulation of meiosis-related genes, which causes failure of \nmaturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation. ATAC-seq analysis in oocytes \nrevealed that Snf2h regulates transcription of key meiotic genes, such as \nPrkar2b, by increasing its promoter chromatin accessibility. Thus, our studies \nnot only demonstrate the importance of Snf2h in oocyte meiotic resumption, but \nalso reveal the mechanism underlying how a chromatin remodeling factor can \nregulate oocyte meiosis.",

A gradual decrease of \nMETTL14 (methyltransferase like 14) and an increase of ALKBH5 (alkB homolog 5, \nRNA demethylase) were observed in LCs during their differentiation from stem LCs \nto adult LCs. These events led to reduced mRNA methylation levels of \nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) and enhanced autophagy in LCs. Similar regulation of \nMETTL14, ALKBH5, and m6A was also observed in LCs upon treatment with human \nchorionic gonadotropin (HsCG). Mechanistically, m6A modification promoted \ntranslation of PPM1A (protein phosphatase 1A, magnesium dependent, alpha \nisoform), a negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulator, but \ndecreased expression of CAMKK2 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \nkinase 2, beta), a positive AMPK regulator, by reducing its RNA stability. Thus, \nm6A modification resulted in reduced AMPK activity and subsequent autophagy \ninhibition. We further demonstrated that ALKBH5 upregulation by HsCG was \ndependent on enhanced binding of the transcriptional factor CEBPB \n(CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [C/EBP], beta) and the TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB) to its gene promoter. Moreover, HsCG treatment decreased METTL14 by \nreducing its stability.

Bazedoxifene (BZA), a third-generation \nselective estrogen receptor modulator, was discovered by multiple ligand \nsimultaneous docking and drug repositioning approaches to have a novel function \nas an IL-6/GP130 target inhibitor. Thus, we speculated that in colon cancer, the \nanti-tumor efficacy of 5-FU might be increased in combination with IL-6/GP130 \ninhibitors. CCK8 assay and colony formation assay were used to detect the cell \nproliferation and colony formation. We measured the IC50 value of 5-FU alone and \nin combination with BZA by cell viability inhibition. Cell migration and \ninvasion ability were tested by scratch migration assays and transwell invasion \nassays. Flow cytometric analysis for cell apoptosis and cell cycle. Quantitative \nreal-time PCR was used to detect Bad, Bcl-2 and Ki-67 mRNA expression and \nwestern blotting (WB) assay analyzed protein expression of Bad/Bcl-2 signaling \npathway. Further mechanism study, WB analysis detected the key proteins level in \nIL-6/GP130 targets and JAK/STAT3, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling \npathway. A colon cancer xenograft model was used to further confirm the efficacy \nof 5-FU and BZA in vivo. The GP130, P-STAT3, P-AKT, and P-ERK expression levels \nwere detected by immunohistochemistry in the xenograft tumor. BZA markedly \npotentiates the anti-tumor function of 5-FU in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, \n5-FU activation is reduced following exogenous IL-6 treatment in cells. Further \nmechanistic studies determined that BZA treatment enhanced 5-FU anti-tumor \nactivation by inhibiting the IL-6/GP130 signaling pathway and the \nphosphorylation status of the downstream effectors AKT, ERK and STAT3. In \ncontrast, IL-6 can attenuate 5-FU function via activating IL-6R/GP130 signaling \nand the P-AKT, P-ERK and P-STAT3 levels. This study firstly verifies that \ntargeting IL-6/GP130 signaling can increase the anti-tumor function of 5-FU; in \naddition, this strategy can sensitize cancer cell drug sensitivity, implying \nthat blocking IL-6/GP130 targets can reverse chemoresistance. Therefore, \ncombining 5-FU and IL-6/GP130 target inhibitors may be a promising approach for \ncancer treatment.",

Here \nwe report that peritoneal macrophage respiration is enhanced by rosiglitazone, \nan activating PPARγ ligand, in a PPARγ-dependent manner. Moreover, PPARγ is \nrequired for macrophage respiration even in the absence of exogenous ligand. \nUnexpectedly, the absence of PPARγ dramatically affects the oxidation of \nglutamine. Both glutamine and PPARγ have been implicated in alternative \nactivation (AA) of macrophages, and PPARγ was required for interleukin 4 \n(IL4)-dependent gene expression and stimulation of macrophage respiration. \nIndeed, unstimulated macrophages lacking PPARγ contained elevated levels of the \ninflammation-associated metabolite itaconate and express a proinflammatory \ntranscriptome that, remarkably, phenocopied that of macrophages depleted of \nglutamine. Thus, PPARγ functions as a checkpoint, guarding against inflammation, \nand is permissive for AA by facilitating glutamine metabolism. However, PPARγ \nexpression is itself markedly increased by IL4. This suggests that PPARγ \nfunctions at the center of a feed-forward loop that is central to AA of \nmacrophages.",

MPM diagnosis is late and often \nchallenging, suggesting the need to identify more reliable molecular biomarkers. \nHere, we set out to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in epithelioid, \nbiphasic, and sarcomatoid MPMs versus normal mesothelium and explored specific \nmiRNA contribution to mesothelial tumorigenesis. We screened an LNA™-based \nmiRNA-microrray with 14 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) MPMs and 6 \nnormal controls. Through real-time qRT-PCR we extended the analysis of a miRNA \nsubset and further investigated miR-320a role through state-of-the-art \ntechniques. We identified 16 upregulated and 32 downregulated miRNAs in MPMs \nversus normal tissue, including the previously identified potential biomarkers \nmiR-21, miR-126, miR-143, miR-145. We showed in an extended series that miR-145, \nmiR-10b, and miR-320a levels can discriminate tumor versus controls with high \nspecificity and sensitivity. We focused on miR-320a because other family members \nwere found downregulated in MPMs. However, stable miR-320a ectopic expression \ninduced higher proliferation and migration ability, whereas miR-320a silencing \nreduced these processes, not supporting a classic tumor-suppressor role in MPM \ncell lines. Among putative targets, we found that miR-320a binds the 3'-UTR of \nthe immune inhibitory receptor ligand PDL1 and, consistently, miR-320a \nmodulation affects PDL1 levels in MPM cells. Finally, we showed that p53 \nover-expression induces the upregulation of miR-320a, along with miR-200a and \nmiR-34a, both known to target PDL1, and reduces PDL1 levels in MPM cells. Our \ndata suggest that PDL1 expression might be due to a defective p53-regulated \nmiRNA response, which could contribute to MPM immune evasion or tumorigenesis \nthrough tumor-intrinsic roles.",

However, the mechanism of SKA3 regulating tumor \nproliferation via reprogramming metabolism is unknown. Here, SKA3 is identified \nas an oncogene in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and high levels of \nSKA3 are closely associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis. In \nvitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that SKA3 promotes LSCC cell \nproliferation and chemoresistance through a novel role of reprogramming \nglycolytic metabolism. Further studies reveal the downstream mechanisms of SKA3, \nwhich can bind and stabilize polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) protein via suppressing \nubiquitin-mediated degradation. The accumulation of PLK1 activates AKT and thus \nupregulates glycolytic enzymes HK2, PFKFB3, and PDK1, resulting in enhancement \nof glycolysis. Furthermore, our data reveal that phosphorylation at Thr360 of \nSKA3 is critical for its binding to PLK1 and the increase in glycolysis. \nCollectively, the novel oncogenic signal axis \"SKA3-PLK1-AKT\" plays a critical \nrole in the glycolysis of LSCC. SKA3 may serve as a prognostic biomarker and \ntherapeutic target, providing a potential strategy for proliferation inhibition \nand chemosensitization in tumors, especially for LSCC patients with PLK1 \ninhibitor resistance.",

Here, we report an \nunexpected role for SHP in the exocrine pancreas as a modulator of the \nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. SHP expression is induced in acinar \ncells in response to ER stress and regulates the protein stability of the \nspliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s), a key mediator of ER stress \nresponse. Loss of SHP reduces XBP1s protein level and transcriptional activity, \nwhich in turn attenuates the ER stress response during the fasting-feeding \ncycle. Consequently, SHP-deficient mice also are more susceptible to \ncerulein-induced pancreatitis. Mechanistically, we show that SHP physically \ninteracts with the transactivation domain of XBP1s, thereby inhibiting the \npolyubiquitination and degradation of XBP1s by the Cullin3-SPOP (speckle-type \nPOZ protein) E3 ligase complex. Together, our data implicate SHP in governing ER \nhomeostasis and identify a novel posttranslational regulatory mechanism for the \nkey ER stress response effector XBP1.",

We show that UAP56 depletion causes R-loop \naccumulation, R-loop-mediated genome instability, and replication fork stalling. \nWe demonstrate an RNA-DNA helicase activity in UAP56 and show that its \noverexpression suppresses R loops and genome instability induced by depleting \nfive different unrelated factors. UAP56/DDX39B localizes to active chromatin and \nprevents the accumulation of RNA-DNA hybrids over the entire genome. We propose \nthat, in addition to its RNA processing role, UAP56/DDX39B is a key helicase \nrequired to eliminate harmful cotranscriptional RNA structures that otherwise \nwould block transcription and replication.",

Here, we used start codon-specific reporters and ribosome profiling \nto characterize how translation from non-AUG start codons responds to protein \nsynthesis inhibitors in human cells. These analyses surprisingly revealed that \ntranslation of multiple non-AUG-encoded reporters and the endogenous GUG-encoded \nDAP5 (eIF4G2/p97) mRNA is resistant to cycloheximide (CHX), a translation \ninhibitor that severely slows but does not completely abrogate elongation.

Although details of the \nmolecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neuronal death in PD remain \nunclear, neuroinflammation is also considered a potent mediator in the \npathogenesis and progression of PD. In the present study, we present evidences \nthat microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is critical for dopaminergic \nneuronal loss and the subsequent motor deficits in the \n1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. \nSpecifically, NLRP3 deficiency significantly reduces motor dysfunctions and \ndopaminergic neurodegeneration of MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, NLRP3 \ndeficiency abolishes MPTP-induced microglial recruitment, interleukin-1β \nproduction and caspase-1 activation in the SN of mouse brain. In primary \nmicroglia and mixed glial cell cultures, MPTP/ATP treatment promotes the robust \nassembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via producing mitochondrial \nreactive oxygen species.

These findings reveal a \nnovel priming role of neurotoxin MPTP or MPP+ for NLRP3 activation. \nSubsequently, NLRP3 inflammasome-active microglia induces profound neuronal \ndeath in a microglia-neuron co-culture model. Furthermore, Cx3Cr1CreER-based \nmicroglia-specific expression of an active NLRP3 mutant greatly exacerbates \nmotor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss of MPTP-treated mice.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that apoptosis \nplays an important role in the adaptation of skeletal muscle function. However, \nthe underlying mechanism of apoptosis that is induced by stretch continues to be \nincompletely understood. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), a newly defined \nsignaling pathway, initiates apoptosis. This study seeks to determine if \ncaspase-12 is involved in stretch-induced apoptosis mediated endoplasmic \nreticulum stress in myoblast and its underlying mechanism. Apoptosis was \nassessed by Hochest staining, DAPI staining and annexin V binding and PI \nstaining. ER chaperones, such as GRP78, CHOP and caspase-12, were determined by \nreverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot. \nFurthermore, caspase-12 inhibitor was used to value the mechanism of the \ncaspase-12 pathway. Apoptosis of myoblast, which is subjected to cyclic stretch, \nwas observed in a time-dependent manner. We found that GRP78 mRNA and protein \nwere significantly increased and CHOP and caspase-12 were activated in myoblast \nthat was exposed to cyclic stretch.

In this study we show that \nmutations in HSPB1 lead to impairment of macroautophagic/autophagic flux.

Mutations in HSPB1 lead to a decrease \nin the formation of SQSTM1/p62 bodies, and subsequent impairment of phagophore \nformation, suggesting a regulatory role for HSPB1 in autophagy via interaction \nwith SQSTM1.

To explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a \ncell-based functional screening with SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, \nusing an siRNA library and identified TMED10 (transmembrane p24 trafficking \nprotein 10), previously known as the γ-secretase-modulating protein, as a novel \nregulator of autophagy. Further investigations revealed that depletion of TMED10 \ninduced the activation of autophagy. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction \nassays showed that TMED10 directly binds to ATG4B (autophagy related gene 4B \ncysteine peptidase), and the interaction is diminished under autophagy \nactivation conditions such as rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation. In \naddition, inhibition of TMED10 significantly enhanced the proteolytic activity \nof ATG4B for LC3 cleavage. Importantly, the expression of TMED10 in AD \n(Alzheimer disease) patients was considerably decreased, and downregulation of \nTMED10 increased amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Treatment with Aβ increased ATG4B \nproteolytic activity as well as dissociation of TMED10 and ATG4B. Taken \ntogether, our results suggest that the AD-associated protein TMED10 negatively \nregulates autophagy by inhibiting ATG4B activity.",

However, the mechanism by which the initial injury of tubular \nepithelial cells (TECs) drives interstitial inflammation remains unclear. This \npaper aims to explore the role of exosomal miRNAs derived from TECs in the \ndevelopment of tubulointerstitial inflammation. Global microRNA(miRNA) \nexpression profiling of renal exosomes was examined in a LPS induced acute \nkidney injury (AKI) mouse model and miR-19b-3p was identified as the miRNA that \nwas most notably increased in TEC-derived exosomes compared to controls. Similar \nresults were also found in an adriamycin (ADR) induced chronic proteinuric \nkidney disease model in which exosomal miR-19b-3p was markedly released. \nInterestingly, once released, TEC-derived exosomal miR-19b-3p was internalized \nby macrophages, leading to M1 phenotype polarization through targeting \nNF-κB/SOCS-1. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SOCS-1 was the \ndirect target of miR-19b-3p. Importantly, the pathogenic role of exosomal \nmiR-19b-3p in initiating renal inflammation was revealed by the ability of \nadoptively transferred of purified TEC-derived exosomes to cause \ntubulointerstitial inflammation in mice, which was reversed by inhibition of \nmiR-19b-3p. Clinically, high levels of miR-19b-3p were found in urinary exosomes \nand were correlated with the severity of tubulointerstitial inflammation in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. Thus, our studies demonstrated that exosomal \nmiR-19b-3p mediated the communication between injured TECs and macrophages, \nleading to M1 macrophage activation. The exosome/miR-19b-3p/SOCS1 axis played a \ncritical pathologic role in tubulointerstitial inflammation, representing a new \ntherapeutic target for kidney disease.",

However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in \nhuman cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene \nRAB39b are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder \n(ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain \nremain unknown. We generated Rab39b knockout (KO) mice and found that they \nexhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD \nbehaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human \ncerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation \nand impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble \nneurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b \ninteracts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling \nin NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly \nenhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely \ndetectable in rodents but abundant in human brains.

The Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1)/eyes absent \n(EYA) transcriptional complex plays a critical role in the development of \nmultiple organs and is typically downregulated after development is complete. In \nbreast cancer, aberrant expression of SIX1 has been demonstrated to stimulate \nmetastasis through activation of TGFβ signaling and subsequent induction of \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, SIX1 can induce metastasis \nvia non-cell autonomous means, including activation of GLI-signaling in \nneighboring tumor cells and activation of VEGFC-induced lymphangiogenesis. Thus, \ntargeting SIX1 would be expected to inhibit metastasis while conferring limited \nside effects. However, transcription factors are notoriously difficult to \ntarget, and thus novel approaches to inhibit their action must be taken. Here we \nidentified a novel small molecule compound, NCGC00378430 (abbreviated as 8430), \nthat reduces the SIX1/EYA2 interaction. 8430 partially reversed transcriptional \nand metabolic profiles mediated by SIX1 overexpression and reversed SIX1-induced \nTGFβ signaling and EMT. 8430 was well tolerated when delivered to mice and \nsignificantly suppressed breast cancer-associated metastasis in vivo without \nsignificantly altering primary tumor growth. Thus, we have demonstrated for the \nfirst time that pharmacologic inhibition of the SIX1/EYA2 complex and associated \nphenotypes is sufficient to suppress breast cancer metastasis.",

However, while arrested, senescent cells secrete a variety of \nproteins collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype \n(SASP), which can reinforce the arrest and induce senescence in a paracrine \nmanner. However, the SASP has also been shown to favor embryonic development, \nwound healing, and even tumor growth, suggesting more complex physiological \nroles than currently understood. Here we uncover timely new functions of the \nSASP in promoting a proregenerative response through the induction of cell \nplasticity and stemness. We show that primary mouse keratinocytes transiently \nexposed to the SASP exhibit increased expression of stem cell markers and \nregenerative capacity in vivo. However, prolonged exposure to the SASP causes a \nsubsequent cell-intrinsic senescence arrest to counter the continued \nregenerative stimuli. Finally, by inducing senescence in single cells in vivo in \nthe liver, we demonstrate that this activates tissue-specific expression of stem \ncell markers. Together, this work uncovers a primary and beneficial role for the \nSASP in promoting cell plasticity and tissue regeneration and introduces the \nconcept that transient therapeutic delivery of senescent cells could be \nharnessed to drive tissue regeneration.",

However, a caspase-independent mechanism initiated by \npoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation has been reported to make \nmore contribution to cells death after ischemic stroke. In the present study, we \nestablished a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat model through middle \ncerebral artery occlusion following reperfusion to investigate the mechanisms of \nischemic tissue recovery following baicalein treatment. The data showed that \nbaicalein treatment at dose of 100 mg/kg for 7 days significantly inhibited the \nrelease of cytokines, activation of PARP-1, nuclear translocation of \napoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) \nin cerebral I/R rats, therefore decreased cerebral infarct volume and \nneurological scores. Then, we further investigated the signal transduction \nmechanisms of ischemic tissue protection by baicalein in vitro. Following oxygen \nand glucose deprivation (OGD) in SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial AIF was \ntranslocated into nucleus after 12 h. The co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed \nthat the interaction between AIF and MIF was activated by OGD and subsequently \nresulted in MIF nuclear translocation. Also, the baicalein inhibited apoptosis, \nreduced oxidative stress, protected mitochondrial function and restored \nmitochondrial membrane potential in OGD cells. The results obtained from both in \nvivo and in vitro study demonstrated the PARP-1/AIF pathway involved in \nmechanisms of baicalein to protect the cerebral tissues from ischemic injury.",

            "TEXT": "CircFOXK2 Promotes Growth and Metastasis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by \nComplexing with RNA-Binding Proteins and Sponging MiR-942.\n\nThe detailed biological functions of circular RNA (circRNA) are largely \nunexplored. Using circRNA sequencing, we identified 169 differentially expressed \ncircRNA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells compared with nontumor \nhuman pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Among them, circFOXK2 was validated \nwith significant upregulation in PDAC cells and 63% of primary tumors (53 of \n84). circFOXK2 promoted cell growth, migration, and invasion and was involved in \ncell-cycle progression and apoptosis. circFOXK2 contained multiple miRNA binding \nsites, functioning as a sponge for miR-942, which in turn promoted expression of \nANK1, GDNF, and PAX6. A novel and highly specific circRNA-pulldown followed by \nmass spectrometry analysis identified 94 circFOXK2-interacting proteins, which \nwere involved in cell adhesion, mRNA splicing, and structural molecule activity. \nOf these, circFOKX2 interactions with YBX1 and hnRNPK enhanced expression of \noncogenes NUF2 and PDXK. Knockdown of circFOXK2 reduced binding of YBX1 and \nhnRNPK to NUF2 and PDXK, in turn decreasing their expression. Collectively, our \nfindings demonstrate that circFOXK2 in complex with YBX1 and hnRNPK promotes \nexpression of oncogenic proteins that contribute to PDAC progression. \nSIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals a prominent role for the circRNA circFOXK2 in \nPDAC progression, suggesting that circFOXK2 might be a novel diagnostic marker \nfor PDAC.",

Here, we investigate the feasibility of a novel \nHER2-targeted affibody-based conjugate (ZHER2:2395-IR700) selectively to induce \ncancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. The studies in vitro confirmed the \nspecificity of ZHER2:2395-IR700 binding to HER2-positive cells and its ability \nto produce reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation. A conjugate \nconcentration- and light irradiation-dependent decrease in cell viability was \nalso demonstrated. Furthermore, light-activated ZHER2:2395-IR700 triggered all \nhallmarks of immunogenic cell death, as defined by the translocation of \ncalreticulin to the cell surface, and the secretion of ATP, HSP70/90 and HMGB1 \nfrom dying cancer cells into the medium. Irradiating a co-culture of immature \ndendritic cells (DCs) and cancer cells exposed to light-activated \nZHER2:2395-IR700 enhanced DC maturation, as indicated by augmented expression of \nCD86 and HLA-DR. In SKOV-3 xenografts, the ZHER2:2395-IR700-based phototherapy \ndelayed tumour growth and increased median overall survival. Collectively, our \nresults strongly suggest that ZHER2:2395-IR700 is a promising new therapeutic \nconjugate that has great potential to be applicable for photoimmunotherapy-based \nregimens.",

The human homologs of Hel25E \nsimilarly regulate circRNA localization, as depletion of UAP56 (DDX39B) or URH49 \n(DDX39A) causes long and short circRNAs, respectively, to become enriched in the \nnucleus. These data suggest that the lengths of mature circRNAs are measured to \ndictate the mode of nuclear export.",

Most cells maintain telomere \nrepeat lengths by using the enzyme telomerase, although there are some cancer \ncells that use a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere extension, termed \nalternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Cells that use ALT are \ncharacterized, in part, by the presence of specialized PML nuclear bodies called \nALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs localize to and cluster telomeric ends \ntogether with telomeric and DNA damage factors, which led to the proposal that \nthese bodies act as a platform on which ALT can occur. However, the necessity of \nAPBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used \nCRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly \ndefine the function of APBs in ALT. We found that PML is required for the ALT \nmechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs' role in localizing the \nBLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends. Strikingly, recruitment of the \nBTR complex to telomeres in a PML-independent manner bypasses the need for PML \nin the ALT pathway, suggesting that BTR localization to telomeres is sufficient \nto sustain ALT activity.",

However, the \nenzymes involved in the regulation of BCL2A1 protein stability are currently \nunknown. Here, we provide the first insight into the regulation of BCL2A1 \nubiquitination.

Indeed, endogenous TRIM28 and BCL2A1 bind to each other at the \nmitochondria and TRIM28 knock-down decreases BCL2A1 ubiquitination. We also show \nthat TRIM17 stabilizes BCL2A1 by blocking TRIM28 from binding and ubiquitinating \nBCL2A1, and that GSK3 is involved in the phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of \nBCL2A1 degradation. BCL2A1 and its close relative MCL1 are thus regulated by \ncommon factors but with opposite outcome. Finally, overexpression of TRIM28 or \nknock-out of TRIM17 reduced BCLA1 protein levels and restored sensitivity of \nmelanoma cells to BRAF-targeted therapy.

Here we utilize data from 12 cancer types \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas to comprehensively map lncRNAs that are potentially \nderegulated by DNA methylation. A novel DNA methylation-deregulated and RNA m6A \nreader-cooperating lncRNA (DMDRMR) facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in \nclear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

Consequently, DMDRMR and IGF2BP3 \nenhanced the G1-S transition, thus promoting cell proliferation in ccRCC. In \npatients with ccRCC, high coexpression of DMDRMR and IGF2BP3 was associated with \npoor outcomes. Our findings reveal that DMDRMR cooperates with IGF2BP3 to \nregulate target genes in an m6A-dependent manner and may represent a potential \ndiagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic target in ccRCC.

One such chemokine, Stromal cell-derived factor-1 \n(SDF-1) also known as CXCL12, and its receptor, CXCR4, are expressed and \nfunctional in cardiac myocytes. SDF-1 both stimulates and enhances the cellular \nsignal which attracts potentially beneficial stem cells for tissue repair within \nthe ischemic heart. Paradoxically however, this chemokine is known to act in \nconcert with the inflammatory cytokines of the innate immune response which \ncontributes to cellular injury through the recruitment of inflammatory cells \nduring ischemia. In the present study, we have demonstrated that SDF-1 has dose \ndependent effects on freshly isolated cardiomyocytes. Using Tunnel and caspase \n3-activation assays, we have demonstrated that the treatment of isolated adult \nrat cardiac myocyte with SDF-1 at higher concentrations (pathological \nconcentrations) induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ELISA data demonstrated that the \ntreatment of isolated adult rat cardiac myocyte with SDF-1 at higher \nconcentrations upregulated TNF-α protein expression which directly correlated \nwith subsequent apoptosis. There was a significant reduction in SDF-1 mediated \napoptosis when TNF-α expression was neutralized which suggests that SDF-1 \nmediated apoptosis is TNF-α-dependent. The fact that certain stimuli are capable \nof driving cardiomyocytes into apoptosis indicates that these cells are \nsusceptible to clinically relevant apoptotic triggers. Our findings suggest that \nthe elevated SDF-1 levels seen in a variety of clinical conditions, including \nischemic myocardial infarction, may either directly or indirectly contribute to \ncardiac cell death via a TNF-α mediated pathway. This highlights the importance \nof this receptor/ligand in regulating the cardiomyocyte response to stress \nconditions.",

Cell viability and cell death were quantified by \nusing cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and Calcein-AM/propidium iodine (PI) staining \nrespectively. Necroptosis-associated target molecules receptor-interacing \nprotein kinase 1 (RIPK1), phosphorylated RIPK1 (pRIPK1), receptor-interacing \nprotein kinase 3 (RIPK3), phosphorylated RIPK3 (pRIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase \ndomain-like (MLKL) were analyzed by Western-blot and RT-PCR. NP cells were also \nexamined for morphological and ultrastructural changes, which can indicate \nnecroptosis. To indirectly establish the presence of necroptosis, the RIPK1 \nspecific inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872, MLKL \ninhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were \nutilized. The results established necroptosis was taking place in NP cells. The \nlevel of necroptosis increased in a time-dependent manner, and this effect was \nreduced by Nec-1 in vitro. Additionally, NP cells death were significantly \nattenuated following treatment with Nec-1, GSK'872 or NSA. SiRNA-induced \nknockdown of RIPK3 or MLKL increased cell survival rate, while knockdown of \nRIPK1 resulted in a decreased cell survival rate. In summary, \nRIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis may play an important role in NP cells \ndeath induced by continuous mechanical stress. Treatment strategies which aim to \nregulate necroptosis may prove beneficial, by both reducing NP cells death and \nslowing IVD degeneration.",

We predicted \npotential interactions between human autophagy proteins and effector proteins \nfrom 56 pathogenic bacterial species by identifying bacterial proteins predicted \nto have recognition motifs for selective autophagy receptors SQSTM1/p62, \nCALCOCO2/NDP52 and MAP1LC3/LC3.

The \ncomplementarity between the predicted SQSTM1/p62 and CALCOCO2/NDP52 targets, \nwhich has been shown for Salmonella, Listeria and Shigella, could be observed \nacross other pathogens. This complementarity potentially leaves the host more \nsusceptible to chronic infections upon the mutation of autophagy receptors. \nProteins derived from enterotoxigenic and non-toxigenic Bacillus outer membrane \nvesicles indicated that autophagy targets pathogenic proteins rather than \nnon-pathogenic ones.

We modeled acquired resistance to \nosimertinib in transgenic mouse models of EGFRL858R -induced lung adenocarcinoma \nand found that it is mediated largely through secondary mutations in EGFR-either \nC797S or L718V/Q.

The immunomodulatory effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can \ncontribute to the treatment of inflammatory disorders. In previous studies, the \nfocus was on innate immune cells and the effects of MSCs on ALI through CD8+ T \ncells remain unclear.

Survival rate, histopathological changes, protein levels, total \ncell count, cytokine levels, and chemokine levels in alveolar lavage fluid were \nused to determine the efficacy of MSCs. Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA \nsequencing (scRNA-seq) were used to characterize the CD8+ T cells in the lungs. \nLy6C- CD8+ T cells are prevalent in normal mice, whereas a specialized effector \nphenotype expressing a high level of Ly6C is predominant in advanced disease. \nMSCs significantly mitigated ALI and improved survival.

The transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 (zinc \nand ring finger 3) and RNF43 (ring finger protein 43) antagonize Wnt signaling \nby promoting degradation of frizzled receptors. ZNRF3 and RNF43 are frequently \ninactivated in human cancer, but the molecular and therapeutic implications \nremain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adrenocortical-specific loss of ZNRF3, \nbut not RNF43, results in adrenal hyperplasia that depends on Porcupine-mediated \nWnt ligand secretion. Furthermore, we discovered a Wnt/β-catenin signaling \ngradient in the adrenal cortex that is disrupted upon loss of ZNRF3. Unlike \nβ-catenin gain-of-function models, which induce high Wnt/β-catenin activation \nand expansion of the peripheral cortex, ZNRF3 loss triggers activation of \nmoderate-level Wnt/β-catenin signaling that drives proliferative expansion of \nonly the histologically and functionally distinct inner cortex. Genetically \nreducing β-catenin dosage significantly reverses the ZNRF3-deficient phenotype. \nThus, homeostatic maintenance of the adrenal cortex is dependent on varying \nlevels of Wnt/β-catenin activation, which is regulated by ZNRF3.",

            "TEXT": "Mutant CFTR Drives TWIST1 mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenetic disease resulting from mutations in the \nCystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene encoding an \nanion channel. Recent evidence indicates that CFTR plays a role in other \ncellular processes, namely in development, cellular differentiation and wound \nhealing. Accordingly, CFTR has been proposed to function as a tumour suppressor \nin a wide range of cancers. Along these lines, CF was recently suggested to be \nassociated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a latent developmental \nprocess, which can be re-activated in fibrosis and cancer. However, it is \nunknown whether EMT is indeed active in CF and if EMT is triggered by \ndysfunctional CFTR itself or a consequence of secondary complications of CF. In \nthis study, we investigated the occurrence of EMT in airways native tissue, \nprimary cells and cell lines expressing mutant CFTR through the expression of \nepithelial and mesenchymal markers as well as EMT-associated transcription \nfactors. Transepithelial electrical resistance, proliferation and regeneration \nrates, and cell resistance to TGF-β1induced EMT were also measured. CF \ntissues/cells expressing mutant CFTR displayed several signs of active EMT, \nnamely: destructured epithelial proteins, defective cell junctions, increased \nlevels of mesenchymal markers and EMT-associated transcription factors, \nhyper-proliferation and impaired wound healing. Importantly, we found evidence \nthat the mutant CFTR triggered EMT was mediated by EMT-associated transcription \nfactor TWIST1. Further, our data show that CF cells are over-sensitive to EMT \nbut the CF EMT phenotype can be reversed by CFTR modulator drugs. Altogether, \nthese results identify for the first time that EMT is intrinsically triggered by \nthe absence of functional CFTR through a TWIST1 dependent mechanism and indicate \nthat CFTR plays a direct role in EMT protection. This mechanistic link is a \nplausible explanation for the high incidence of fibrosis and cancer in CF, as \nwell as for the role of CFTR as tumour suppressor protein.",

The histone demethylase JMJD1A has \nbeen shown to regulate activities of AR and c-Myc transcription factors and \npromote prostate cancer progression. Here, we report that JMJD1A protein \nstability is controlled by the ubiquitin ligase STUB1. High levels of JMJD1A \nwere strongly correlated with low STUB1 levels in human CRPC specimens. STUB1 \ninhibited AR activity, AR-V7 levels, and prostate cancer cell growth partly \nthrough degradation of JMJD1A. Furthermore, the acetyltransferase p300 \nacetylated JMJD1A at lysine (K) 421, a modification that recruits the BET family \nmember BRD4 to block JMJD1A degradation and promote JMJD1A recruitment to AR \ntargets. Increased levels of both total and K421-acetylated JMJD1A were observed \nin prostate cancer cells as they developed resistance to the AR antagonist \nenzalutamide. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with either p300 or BET \ninhibitors destabilized JMJD1A, and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells \nwere more sensitive than parental cells to these inhibitors. Together, our \nfindings identify a critical role for acetylation of JMJD1A in regulating JMJD1A \nstability and AR activity in CRPC. These newly identified mechanisms controlling \nJMJD1A protein stability provide potential druggable targets to encourage the \ndevelopment of additional therapies for advanced prostate cancer.

Here, we investigated the effect of perineural invasion on the \nmicroenvironment and how this affects PDAC progression. Transcriptome expression \nprofiles of PDAC tissues with different perineural invasion status were \ncompared, and the intratumoral T-cell density and levels of neurotransmitters in \nthese tissues were assessed. Perineural invasion was associated with impaired \nimmune responses characterized by decreased CD8+ T and Th1 cells, and increased \nTh2 cells. Acetylcholine levels were elevated in severe perineural invasion. \nAcetylcholine impaired the ability of PDAC cells to recruit CD8+ T cells via \nHDAC1-mediated suppression of CCL5. Moreover, acetylcholine directly inhibited \nIFNγ production by CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner and favored Th2 over \nTh1 differentiation. Furthermore, hyperactivation of cholinergic signaling \nenhanced tumor growth by suppressing the intratumoral T-cell response in an \northotopic PDAC model. Conversely, blocking perineural invasion with bilateral \nsubdiaphragmatic vagotomy in tumor-bearing mice was associated with an increase \nin CD8+ T cells, an elevated Th1/Th2 ratio, and improved survival. In \nconclusion, perineural invasion-triggered cholinergic signaling favors tumor \ngrowth by promoting an immune-suppressive microenvironment characterized by \nimpaired CD8+ T-cell infiltration and a reduced Th1/Th2 ratio.",

            "TEXT": "UBR5 Is Coamplified with MYC in Breast Tumors and Encodes an Ubiquitin Ligase \nThat Limits MYC-Dependent Apoptosis.\n\nFor maximal oncogenic activity, cellular MYC protein levels need to be tightly \ncontrolled so that they do not induce apoptosis. Here, we show how ubiquitin \nligase UBR5 functions as a molecular rheostat to prevent excess accumulation of \nMYC protein. UBR5 ubiquitinates MYC and its effects on MYC protein stability are \nindependent of FBXW7. Silencing of endogenous UBR5 induced MYC protein \nexpression and regulated MYC target genes. Consistent with the tumor suppressor \nfunction of UBR5 (HYD) in Drosophila, HYD suppressed dMYC-dependent overgrowth \nof wing imaginal discs. In contrast, in cancer cells, UBR5 suppressed \nMYC-dependent priming to therapy-induced apoptosis. Of direct cancer relevance, \nMYC and UBR5 genes were coamplified in MYC-driven human cancers. Functionally, \nUBR5 suppressed MYC-mediated apoptosis in p53-mutant breast cancer cells with \nUBR5/MYC coamplification. Furthermore, single-cell immunofluorescence analysis \ndemonstrated reciprocal expression of UBR5 and MYC in human basal-type breast \ncancer tissues. In summary, UBR5 is a novel MYC ubiquitin ligase and an \nendogenous rheostat for MYC activity. In MYC-amplified, and p53-mutant breast \ncancer cells, UBR5 has an important role in suppressing MYC-mediated apoptosis \npriming and in protection from drug-induced apoptosis. SIGNIFICANCE: These \nfindings identify UBR5 as a novel MYC regulator, the inactivation of which could \nbe very important for understanding of MYC dysregulation on cancer cells.",

Here, we first show that SLC27A5 expression is downregulated in \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by DNA hypermethylation, and reduced SCL27A5 \nexpression contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis. Both gain- and \nloss-of-function studies demonstrated that SLC27A5 has an antiproliferative \neffect on HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockout of SLC27A5 increases \npolyunsaturated lipids, leading to increased NADP+/NADPH ratio, ROS production \nas well as lipid peroxidation and the subsequent accumulation of \n4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) in hepatoma cells. Mass spectrometry analysis found \nthat 4-HNE directly modifies cysteine residues (Cys513, 518) on KEAP1, thus \nleading KEAP1/NRF2 pathway activation and increases the expression levels of \nNRF2 target genes, such as TXNRD1. Further, SLC27A5 expression negatively \ncorrelates with TXNRD1 expression in hepatoma cells and clinical HCC samples, \nand blockade of NRF2/TXNRD1 using genetic approaches or inhibitors sensitizes \nSLC27A5-deficient hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment. Collectively, we \ndemonstrated that SLC27A5 acts as a novel tumor suppressor by suppressing TXNRD1 \nexpression via the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in HCC. Combination therapy of sorafenib \nand NRF2/TXNRD1 inhibitors may be a promising strategy in personalized HCC \ntreatment.",

            "TEXT": "MEF2c-Dependent Downregulation of Myocilin Mediates Cancer-Induced Muscle \nWasting and Associates with Cachexia in Patients with Cancer.\n\nSkeletal muscle wasting is a devastating consequence of cancer that contributes \nto increased complications and poor survival, but is not well understood at the \nmolecular level. Herein, we investigated the role of Myocilin (Myoc), a skeletal \nmuscle hypertrophy-promoting protein that we showed is downregulated in multiple \nmouse models of cancer cachexia. Loss of Myoc alone was sufficient to induce \nphenotypes identified in mouse models of cancer cachexia, including muscle fiber \natrophy, sarcolemmal fragility, and impaired muscle regeneration. By 18 months \nof age, mice deficient in Myoc showed significant skeletal muscle remodeling, \ncharacterized by increased fat and collagen deposition compared with wild-type \nmice, thus also supporting Myoc as a regulator of muscle quality. In cancer \ncachexia models, maintaining skeletal muscle expression of Myoc significantly \nattenuated muscle loss, while mice lacking Myoc showed enhanced muscle wasting. \nFurthermore, we identified the myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (MEF2C) transcription \nfactor as a key upstream activator of Myoc whose gain of function significantly \ndeterred cancer-induced muscle wasting and dysfunction in a preclinical model of \npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Finally, compared with noncancer \ncontrol patients, MYOC was significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of patients \nwith PDAC defined as cachectic and correlated with MEF2c. These data therefore \nidentify disruptions in MEF2c-dependent transcription of Myoc as a novel \nmechanism of cancer-associated muscle wasting that is similarly disrupted in \nmuscle of patients with cachectic cancer.",

Core lesions, focal areas of \nmitochondria depletion in skeletal muscle fibers, are the most common \nhistopathological lesion. SEPN1-RM underlying mechanisms and the precise role of \nSEPN1 in muscle remained incompletely understood, hindering the development of \nbiomarkers and therapies for this untreatable disease. To investigate the \npathophysiological pathways in SEPN1-RM, we performed metabolic studies, calcium \nand ATP measurements, super-resolution and electron microscopy on in vivo and in \nvitro models of SEPN1 deficiency as well as muscle biopsies from SEPN1-RM \npatients. Mouse models of SEPN1 deficiency showed marked alterations in \nmitochondrial physiology and energy metabolism, suggesting that SEPN1 controls \nmitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, we found that SEPN1 was enriched at the \nmitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), and was needed for calcium transients \nbetween ER and mitochondria, as well as for the integrity of ER-mitochondria \ncontacts. Consistently, loss of SEPN1 in patients was associated with \nalterations in body composition which correlated with the severity of muscle \nweakness, and with impaired ER-mitochondria contacts and low ATP levels. Our \nresults indicate a role of SEPN1 as a novel MAM protein involved in \nmitochondrial bioenergetics. They also identify a systemic bioenergetic \ncomponent in SEPN1-RM and establish mitochondria as a novel therapeutic target. \nThis role of SEPN1 contributes to explain the fatigue and core lesions in \nskeletal muscle as well as the body composition abnormalities identified as part \nof the SEPN1-RM phenotype. Finally, these results point out to an unrecognized \ninterplay between mitochondrial bioenergetics and ER homeostasis in skeletal \nmuscle. They could therefore pave the way to the identification of biomarkers \nand therapeutic drugs for SEPN1-RM and for other disorders in which muscle \nER-mitochondria cross-talk are impaired.",

Specifically, lysosomal \nmembrane damage induces, in succession, ESCRT-dependent membrane repair, \nmacroautophagy/autophagy-dominant removal of damaged lysosomes, and initiation \nof lysosomal biogenesis via transcriptional programs. The MERIT system is \ngoverned by galectins, a family of cytosolically synthesized lectins recognizing \nβ-galactoside glycans. We found in this study that LGALS3 (galectin 3) detects \nmembrane damage by detecting exposed lumenal glycosyl groups, recruits and \norganizes ESCRT components PDCD6IP/ALIX, CHMP4A, and CHMPB at damaged sites on \nthe lysosomes, and facilitates ESCRT-driven repair of lysosomal membrane. At \nlater stages, LGALS3 cooperates with TRIM16, an autophagy receptor-regulator, to \nengage autophagy machinery in removal of excessively damaged lysosomes. In the \nabsence of LGALS3, repair and autophagy are less efficient, whereas TFEB nuclear \ntranslocation increases to compensate lysosomal deficiency via de novo lysosomal \nbiogenesis.

Here, we show that, by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) \nlevels, the conserved macroautophagy/autophagy degradation pathway contributes \nto glucose-regulated root meristem maintenance. In Arabidopsis thaliana roots, a \nshort exposure to elevated glucose temporarily suppresses constitutive \nautophagosome formation. The autophagy-defective autophagy-related gene (atg) \nmutants have enhanced tolerance to glucose, established downstream of the \nglucose sensors, and accumulate less glucose-induced ROS in the root tips. \nMoreover, the enhanced root meristem activities in the atg mutants are \nassociated with improved auxin gradients and auxin responses. By acting with \nAT4G39850/ABCD1 (ATP-binding cassette D1; Formerly PXA1/peroxisomal ABC \ntransporter 1), autophagy plays an indispensable role in the glucose-promoted \ndegradation of root peroxisomes, and the atg mutant phenotype is partially \nrescued by the overexpression of ABCD1. Together, our findings suggest that \nautophagy is an essential mechanism for glucose-mediated maintenance of the root \nmeristem.",

This might be due to an \nincreased hepatocyte apoptosis induced after brain death (BD). In this work, we \nfound that the activity of PP2A-Akt pathway is significantly increased in \nclinical donor ex vivo hepatocytes after BD by iTRAQ protein quantification \nanalysis. The same results were confirmed in animal models. A time-dependent \npromotion of apoptosis was also found in DBD rabbit liver, as demonstrated by \nthe increased levels of cleaved Caspase 3 and the decreased of Bcl-2. To further \ninvestigate the roles of PP2A and Akt in regulating apoptosis of hepatocytes \nafter BD, we cultivated human liver cell line L02 with serum deprivation and \nhypoxia, to simulate the ischemic and hypoxic conditions of hepatocytes in DBD. \nIncreased apoptosis and decreased viability were observed during the time in \nthis model. Meanwhile PP2A activity and Akt activity were respectively increased \nand decreased. Notably, the proportion of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 \ndecreased, while other known targets of PP2A (p38, JNK and ERK) were not \naffected in terms of protein levels or phosphorylation. These results suggested \nthat PP2A is involved in apoptotic induction of hepatocytes after brain death by \nspecific suppression of Akt. This discovery was further confirmed with \npharmaceutical and genetic methods. Our work implied potential targets for \nreducing liver cell apoptosis and improving organ donor quality after BD.",

Seminal studies have shown that \nthe proto-oncogene MYC promotes metabolic reprogramming by altering glutamine \nuptake and metabolism in cancer cells. How MYC regulates the metabolism of other \namino acids in cancer is not fully understood. Using high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that MYC \nincreased intracellular levels of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites in the \nkynurenine pathway. MYC induced the expression of the tryptophan transporters \nSLC7A5 and SLC1A5 and the enzyme arylformamidase (AFMID), involved in the \nconversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. SLC7A5, SLC1A5, and AFMID were \nelevated in colon cancer cells and tissues, and kynurenine was significantly \ngreater in tumor samples than in the respective adjacent normal tissue from \npatients with colon cancer. Compared with normal human colonic epithelial cells, \ncolon cancer cells were more sensitive to the depletion of tryptophan. Blocking \nenzymes in the kynurenine pathway caused preferential death of established colon \ncancer cells and transformed colonic organoids. We found that only kynurenine \nand no other tryptophan metabolite promotes the nuclear translocation of the \ntranscription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Blocking the interaction \nbetween AHR and kynurenine with CH223191 reduced the proliferation of colon \ncancer cells. Therefore, we propose that limiting cellular kynurenine or its \ndownstream targets could present a new strategy to reduce the proliferation of \nMYC-dependent cancer cells.",

Here we report the discovery of SD-36, a \nsmall-molecule degrader of STAT3. SD-36 potently induces the degradation of \nSTAT3 protein in vitro and in vivo and demonstrates high selectivity over other \nSTAT members. Induced degradation of STAT3 results in a strong suppression of \nits transcription network in leukemia and lymphoma cells. SD-36 inhibits the \ngrowth of a subset of acute myeloid leukemia and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma \ncell lines by inducing cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. SD-36 achieves \ncomplete and long-lasting tumor regression in multiple xenograft mouse models at \nwell-tolerated dose schedules. Degradation of STAT3 protein, therefore, is a \npromising cancer therapeutic strategy.",

Upon IL-21 stimulation, AA-FLS \nexpressed elevated levels of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5), Beclin-1 and \nLC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate 3-II (LC3-II) through the utilization of \np62 and inhibition of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). BBR (15-45 µM) inhibited \nautophagy in AA-FLS cells mediated through PI3K/Akt signaling via suppressing \nautophagic elements, p62 sequestration and induction of CHOP in a dose-dependent \nmanner. Moreover, IL-21 promoted the uncontrolled proliferation of AA-FLS \nthrough induction of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and diminished expression of \nBcl-2 associated X protein (BAX) via PI3K/Akt signaling. BBR inhibited the \nproliferation of AA-FLS via promoting apoptosis through increased expression of \nBAX and diminished Bcl-2 transcription factor levels. Furthermore, T cells \nstimulated with IL-21 induced CD4+ CD196+ Th17 cells proliferation through RORγt \nactivation mediated in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner. BBR inhibited the \nproliferation of Th17 cells through downregulation of RORγt in a \nconcentration-dependent manner. BBR also promoted the differentiation of CD4+ \nCD25+ Treg cells through induction of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) activation via \naryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and upregulation of cytochrome P450 family 1, \nsubfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1). Collectively, we conclude that BBR might \nattenuate AA-FLS proliferation through inhibition of IL-21/IL-21R dependent \nautophagy and regulates the Th17/Treg imbalance in RA.",

To date, \nthese therapies have had limited success due to a lack of survival and retention \nof the infused cells. Therefore, it is important to increase our understanding \nof the biology of these cells and utilize this information to enhance their \nsurvival and function in the injured heart. Mitochondria are critical for \nprogenitor cell function and survival. Here, we demonstrate the importance of \nmitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, in the differentiation process in adult \ncardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). We found that mitophagy was rapidly induced \nupon initiation of differentiation in CPCs. We also found that mitophagy was \nmediated by mitophagy receptors, rather than the PINK1-PRKN/PARKIN pathway. \nMitophagy mediated by BNIP3L/NIX and FUNDC1 was not involved in regulating \nprogenitor cell fate determination, mitochondrial biogenesis, or reprogramming. \nInstead, mitophagy facilitated the CPCs to undergo proper mitochondrial network \nreorganization during differentiation. Abrogating BNIP3L- and FUNDC1-mediated \nmitophagy during differentiation led to sustained mitochondrial fission and \nformation of donut-shaped impaired mitochondria. It also resulted in increased \nsusceptibility to cell death and failure to survive the infarcted heart. \nFinally, aging is associated with accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) \ndamage in cells and we found that acquiring mtDNA mutations selectively \ndisrupted the differentiation-activated mitophagy program in CPCs. These \nfindings demonstrate the importance of BNIP3L- and FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy as \na critical regulator of mitochondrial network formation during differentiation, \nas well as the consequences of accumulating mtDNA mutations.",

We \nidentified CHD1 loss as a cause of antiandrogen resistance in an in vivo small \nhairpin RNA (shRNA) screen of 730 genes deleted in prostate cancer. ATAC-seq and \nRNA-seq analyses showed that CHD1 loss resulted in global changes in open and \nclosed chromatin with associated transcriptomic changes. Integrative analysis of \nthis data, together with CRISPR-based functional screening, identified four \ntranscription factors (NR3C1, POU3F2, NR2F1, and TBX2) that contribute to \nantiandrogen resistance, with associated activation of non-luminal lineage \nprograms. Thus, CHD1 loss results in chromatin dysregulation, thereby \nestablishing a state of transcriptional plasticity that enables the emergence of \nantiandrogen resistance through heterogeneous mechanisms.",

Thus, any agent that can induce \napoptosis may be useful for cancer treatment and apoptosis induction is arguably \nthe most potent defense against cancer promotion. In our previous studies, \n2-aryl benzimidazole conjugates were synthesized and evaluated for their \nantiproliferative activity and one of the new molecule (2f) was considered as a \npotential lead. This lead molecule showed significant antiproliferative activity \nagainst human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. The results of the present study \nrevealed that this compound arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase. Topoisomerase \nII inhibition assay and Western blot analysis suggested that this compound \neffectively inhibits topoisomerase II activity which leads to apoptotic cell \ndeath. Apoptosis induction in MCF-7 cells was further confirmed by loss of \nmitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), release of cytochrome c from \nmitochondria, an increase in the level of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), up regulation of proapoptotic \nprotein Bax and down regulation of anti apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Apoptosis assay \nusing Annexin V-FITC assay also suggested that this compound induced cell death \nby apoptosis. However, compound 2f induced apoptosis could not be reversed by \nZ-VAD-FMK (a pan-caspase inhibitor) demonstrated that the 2f induced apoptosis \nwas caspase independent. Further, 2f treatment did not activate caspase-7 and \ncaspase-9 activity, suggesting that this compound induced apoptosis in breast \ncancer cells via a caspase independent pathway. Most importantly, this compound \nwas less toxic towards non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A. \nFurthermore, docking studies also support the potentiality of this molecule to \nbind to the DNA topoisomerase II.",

Smac mimetic \ncompounds (also known as antagonists of IAPs) mimic the function of Smac/Diablo \nand sensitize cancer cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. However, the majority of \ncancer cells are resistant to Smac mimetic alone. Doxorubicin is a widely used \nchemotherapeutic drug and causes adverse effect of cardiotoxicity in many \npatients. Therefore, it is important to find strategies of combined chemotherapy \nto increase chemosensitivity and reduce the adverse effects. Here, we report \nthat doxorubicin synergizes with Smac mimetic to trigger TNF-mediated apoptosis, \nwhich is mechanistically distinct from doxorubicin-induced cell death. \nDoxorubicin sensitizes cancer cells including human pancreatic and colorectal \ncancer cells to Smac mimetic treatment. The combined treatment leads to \nsynergistic induction of TNFα to initiate apoptosis through activating NF-κB and \nc-Jun signaling pathways. Knockdown of caspase-8 or knockout of FADD \nsignificantly blocked apoptosis synergistically induced by Smac mimetic and \ndoxorubicin, but had no effect on cell death caused by doxorubicin alone. \nMoreover, Smac mimetic and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis requires \nreceptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and its deubiquitinating enzyme \ncylindromatosis (CYLD), not A20. These in vitro findings demonstrate that \ncombination of Smac mimetic and doxorubicin synergistically triggers apoptosis \nthrough the TNF/CYLD/RIPK1/FADD/caspase-8 signaling pathway. Importantly, the \ncombined treatment induced in vivo synergistic anti-tumor effects in the \nxenograft tumor model. Thus, the combined therapy using Smac mimetic and \ndoxorubicin presents a promising apoptosis-inducing strategy",

Previously, we have identified fenretinide \n(retinoic acid p-hydroxyanilide) to affect PAX3-FOXO1 expression levels as well \nas FP-RMS cell viability. Here, we characterize the mode of action of \nfenretinide in more detail. First, we demonstrate that fenretinide-induced \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) depends on complex II of the \nmitochondrial respiratory chain, since ROS scavenging as well as complexing of \niron completely abolished cell death. Second, we co-treated cells with a range \nof pharmacological inhibitors of specific cell death pathways including z-vad \n(apoptosis), necrostatin-1 (necroptosis), 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (autophagy), \nand ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis) together with fenretinide. Surprisingly, none of \nthese inhibitors was able to prevent cell death. Also genetic depletion of key \nplayers in the apoptotic and necroptotic pathway (BAK, BAX, and RIPK1) confirmed \nthe pharmacological data. Interestingly however, electron microscopy of \nfenretinide-treated cells revealed an excessive accumulation of cytoplasmic \nvacuoles, which were distinct from autophagosomes. Further flow cytometry and \nfluorescence microscopy experiments suggested a hyperstimulation of \nmacropinocytosis, leading to an accumulation of enlarged early and late \nendosomes. Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition as well as genetic depletion \nof large dynamin GTPases completely abolished fenretinide-induced vesicle \nformation and subsequent cell death, suggesting a new form of dynamin-dependent \nprogrammed cell death. Taken together, our data identify a new form of cell \ndeath mediated through the production of ROS by fenretinide treatment, \nhighlighting the value of this compound for treatment of sarcoma patients \nincluding FP-RMS.",

Emerging evidence has suggested that circular RNAs \n(circRNAs) have important roles in some biological processes. However, it \nremains unclear whether circRNAs participate in the regulation of autophagy. \nHere we report that a circRNA, termed autophagy-related circular RNA (ACR), \nrepresses autophagy and myocardial infarction by targeting Pink1-mediated \nphosphorylation of FAM65B. ACR attenuates autophagy and cell death in \ncardiomyocytes. Moreover, ACR protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) \ninjury and reduces myocardial infarct sizes. We identify Pink1 as an ACR target \nto mediate the function of ACR in cardiomyocyte autophagy. ACR activates Pink1 \nexpression through directly binding to Dnmt3B and blocking Dnmt3B-mediated DNA \nmethylation of Pink1 promoter. Pink1 suppresses autophagy and Pink1 transgenic \nmice show reduced myocardial infarction sizes. Further, we find that FAM65B is a \ndownstream target of Pink1 and Pink1 phosphorylates FAM65B at serine 46. \nPhosphorylated FAM65B inhibits autophagy and cell death in the heart. Our \nfindings reveal a novel role for the circRNA in regulating autophagy and \nACR-Pink1-FAM65B axis as a regulator of autophagy in the heart will be potential \ntherapeutic targets in treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

Here, we investigated the interaction of SH2D4A and STAT3 to shed \nlight on the non-canonical functions of STAT3 in cooperation with the tumor \nsuppressor SH2D4A. Using an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) \napproach, we identified the mitochondrial scaffold proteins prohibitin 1 (PHB1) \nand prohibitin 2 (PHB2) among other proteins to potentially bind to SH2D4A. \nCo-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays confirmed direct \ninteractions of STAT3, PHB1, and SH2D4A in situ and in vitro. In addition, cell \nfractionation and immunofluorescence staining revealed co-localization of these \nproteins with mitochondria. These interactions were selectively interrupted by \nthe small molecule and PHB ligand FL3. Furthermore, FL3 led to a reduction of \nSTAT3 protein levels, STAT3 transcriptional activity, and HIF1α protein \nstabilization upon dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) treatment. Besides, \nmitochondrial fusion and fission markers, L-OPA1, Mfn1, and FIS1, were \ndysregulated upon FL3 treatment. This dysregulated morphology was accompanied by \nsignificant reduction of mitochondrial respiration, thus, FL3 significantly \ndiminished mitochondrial respirational capacity. In contrast, SH2D4A knockout \nincreased mitochondrial respiration, whereas FL3 reversed the effect of SH2D4A \nknockout. The here described results indicate that the interaction of SH2D4A and \nPHB1 is involved in the mitochondrial function and integrity. The demonstrated \ninteraction with STAT3, accompanied by its reduction of transcriptional \nactivity, further suggests that SH2D4A is linking STAT3 to its mitochondrial \nfunctions, and inhibition of PHB-interaction may have therapeutic effects in \ntumor cells with STAT3 activation.",

            "TEXT": "Lactobacillus accelerates ISCs regeneration to protect the integrity of \nintestinal mucosa through activation of STAT3 signaling pathway induced by LPLs \nsecretion of IL-22.\n\nThe regeneration of intestinal epithelial are maintained by continuous \ndifferentiation and proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) under \nphysiological and pathological conditions. However, little is known about the \nregulatory effect of intestinal microbiota on its recovery ability to repair \ndamaged mucosal barrier. In this study, we established intestinal organoids and \nlamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) co-cultured system, plus mice experiments, to \nexplore the protective effect of Lactobacillus reuteri D8 on integrity of \nintestinal mucosa. We found that only live L. reuteri D8 was effective in \nprotecting the morphology of intestinal organoids and normal proliferation of \nepithelial stained with EdU under TNF-α treatment, which was also further \nverified in mice experiments. L. reuteri D8 colonized in the intestinal mucosa \nand ameliorated intestinal mucosa damage caused by DSS treatment, including \nimprovement of body weight, colon length, pathological change, and proliferation \nlevel. The repair process stimulated by L. reuteri D8 was also accompanied with \nincreased numbers of Lgr5+ and lysozyme+ cells both in intestinal organoids and \nmice intestine. Furthermore, we demonstrated that D8 metabolite \nindole-3-aldehyde stimulated LPLs to secret IL-22 through aryl hydrocarbon \nreceptor (AhR) and then induced phosphorylation of STAT3 to accelerate \nproliferation of intestinal epithelial, thus recovering damaged intestinal \nmucosa. Our findings indicate L. reuteri protects intestinal barrier and \nactivates intestinal epithelial proliferation, which sheds light on treatment \napproaches for intestinal inflammation based on ISCs with probiotics \nLactobacillus and daily probiotic consumption in heath foods.",

The clearance of dead cells or efferocytosis is \na critical cellular program of inflammation-resolution. Impaired efferocytosis \ncan lead to tissue damage in prevalent human diseases, like atherosclerosis. \nTherefore understanding mechanisms associated with swift clearance of dead cells \nis of utmost clinical importance. Recently, the accumulation of necroptotic \ncells (NCs) was observed in human plaques and we postulated that this is due to \ndefective clearance programs. Here we present evidence that NCs are \ninefficiently taken up by macrophages because they have increased surface \nexpression of a well-known \"don't eat me\" signal called CD47. High levels of \nCD47 on NCs stimulated RhoA-pMLC signaling in macrophages that promoted \n\"nibbling\", rather than whole-cell engulfment of NCs. Anti-CD47 blocking \nantibodies limited RhoA-p-MLC signaling and promoted whole-cell NC engulfment. \nTreatment with anti-CD47 blocking antibodies to Ldlr-/- mice with established \natherosclerosis decreased necrotic cores, limited the accumulation of plaque NCs \nand increased lesional SPMs, including Resolvin D1 (RvD1) compared with IgG \ncontrols. Mechanistically, RvD1 promoted whole-cell engulfment of NCs by \ndecreasing RhoA signaling and activating CDC42. RvD1 specifically targeted NCs \nfor engulfment by facilitating the release of the well-known \"eat me signal\" \ncalled calreticulin from macrophages in a CDC42 dependent manner. Lastly, RvD1 \nenhanced the clearance of NCs in advanced murine plaques. Together, these \nresults suggest new molecules and signaling associated with the clearance of \nNCs, provide a new paradigm for the regulation of inflammation-resolution, and \noffer a potential treatment strategy for diseases where NCs underpin the \npathology.",

Therefore, \nBRCA1-deficient cancers require adaptations that prevent excessive genomic \nalterations from triggering cell death. RNF168-mediated ubiquitination of γH2AX \nat K13/15 (ub-H2AX) serves as a recruitment module for the localization of 53BP1 \nto DNA break sites. Here, we found multiple BRCA1-mutant cancer cell lines and \nprimary tumors with low levels of RNF168 protein expression. Overexpression of \nectopic RNF168 or a ub-H2AX fusion protein induced cell death and delayed \nBRCA1-mutant tumor formation. Cell death resulted from the recruitment of 53BP1 \nto DNA break sites and inhibition of DNA end resection. Strikingly, \nreintroduction of BRCA1 or 53BP1 depletion restored HR and rescued the ability \nof cells to maintain RNF168 and ub-H2AX overexpression. Thus, downregulation of \nRNF168 protein expression is a mechanism for providing BRCA1-null cancer cell \nlines with a residual level of HR that is essential for viability. Overall, our \nwork identifies loss of RNF168 ubiquitin signaling as a proteomic alteration \nthat supports BRCA1-mutant carcinogenesis. We propose that restoring \nRNF168-ub-H2AX signaling, potentially through inhibition of deubiquitinases, \ncould represent a new therapeutic approach.",

            "TEXT": "Chemotherapeutic paclitaxel and cisplatin differentially induce pyroptosis in \nA549 lung cancer cells via caspase-3/GSDME activation.\n\nGasdermin E (GSDME) has an important role in inducing secondary \nnecrosis/pyroptosis. Upon apoptotic stimulation, it can be cleaved by activated \ncaspase-3 to generate its N-terminal fragment (GSDME-NT), which executes \npyroptosis by perforating the plasma membrane. GSDME is expressed in many human \nlung cancers including A549 cells. Paclitaxel and cisplatin are two \nrepresentative chemotherapeutic agents for lung cancers, which induce apoptosis \nvia different action mechanisms. However, it remains unclear whether they can \ninduce GSDME-mediated secondary necrosis/pyroptosis in lung A549 cancer cells. \nHere we showed that both paclitaxel and cisplatin evidently induced apoptosis in \nA549 cells as revealed by the activation of multiple apoptotic markers. Notably, \nsome of the dying cells displayed characteristic morphology of secondary \nnecrosis/pyroptosis, by blowing large bubbles from the cellular membrane \naccompanied by caspase-3 activation and GSDME-NT generation. But the ability of \ncisplatin to induce this phenomenon was much stronger than that of paclitaxel. \nConsistent with this, cisplatin triggered much higher activation of caspase-3 \nand generation of GSDME-NT than paclitaxel, suggesting that the levels of \nsecondary necrosis/pyroptosis correlated with the levels of active caspase-3 and \nGSDME-NT. Supporting this, caspase-3 specific inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) suppressed \ncisplatin-induced GSDME-NT generation and concurrently reduced the secondary \nnecrosis/pyroptosis. Besides, GSDME knockdown significantly inhibited cisplatin- \nbut not paclitaxel-induced secondary necrosis/pyroptosis. These results \nindicated that cisplatin induced higher levels of secondary necrosis/pyroptosis \nin A549 cells than paclitaxel, suggesting that cisplatin may provide additional \nadvantages in the treatment of lung cancers with high levels of GSDME \nexpression.",

This response is studied \nintensively in epithelial cells, the target of Salmonella during \ngastrointestinal infections. However, little is known of the role that autophagy \nplays in macrophages, the predominant carriers of this pathogen during systemic \ndisease. Here we utilize a zebrafish embryo model to study the interaction of S. \nenterica serovar Typhimurium with the macroautophagy/autophagy machinery of \nmacrophages in vivo. We show that phagocytosis of live but not heat-killed \nSalmonella triggers recruitment of the autophagy marker GFP-Lc3 in a variety of \npatterns labeling tight or spacious bacteria-containing compartments, also \nrevealed by electron microscopy. Neutrophils display similar GFP-Lc3 \nassociations, but genetic modulation of the neutrophil/macrophage balance and \nablation experiments show that macrophages are critical for the defense \nresponse. Deficiency of atg5 reduces GFP-Lc3 recruitment and impairs host \nresistance, in contrast to atg13 deficiency, indicating that Lc3-Salmonella \nassociation at this stage is independent of the autophagy preinitiation complex \nand that macrophages target Salmonella by Lc3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). In \nagreement, GFP-Lc3 recruitment and host resistance are impaired by deficiency of \nRubcn/Rubicon, known as a negative regulator of canonical autophagy and an \ninducer of LAP. We also found strict dependency on NADPH oxidase, another \nessential factor for LAP. Both Rubcn and NADPH oxidase are required to activate \na Salmonella biosensor for reactive oxygen species inside infected macrophages. \nThese results identify LAP as the major host protective autophagy-related \npathway responsible for macrophage defense against Salmonella during systemic \ninfection.",

We previously showed that in colon tumors, a subpopulation of LGR5+ \nCSC-like cells driven by TCF1 (TCF7), a Wnt-responsive transcription factor, \nwere responsible for tumorigenicity. Here we demonstrate that the tumorigenic \nsubpopulation of mouse LGR5+ cells exists in a slow-cycling state and identify a \nunique 22-gene signature that characterizes these slow-cycling CSC. Seven of the \nsignature genes are specifically expressed in slow-cycling LGR5+ cells from \nxenografted human colon tumors and are upregulated in colon cancer clinical \nspecimens. Among these seven, four genes (APCDD1, NOTUM, PROX1, and SP5) are \nknown to be direct Wnt target genes, and PROX1 was expressed in the invasive \nfronts of colon tumors. PROX1 was activated by TCF1 to induce CDKN1C and \nmaintain a slow-cycling state in colon cancer organoids. Strikingly, PROX1 was \nrequired for recurrent growth after chemotherapeutic treatment, suggesting that \ninhibition of slow-cycling CSC by targeting the TCF1-PROX1-CDKN1C pathway is an \neffective strategy to combat refractory colon cancer in combination with \nconventional chemotherapy.",

Although \nthere are different options for treatment, the results are limited. MicroRNAs \n(miRNAs) are a group of small, noncoding, regulatory RNAs with important roles \nin regulating gene expression. miR-145 is reported to be a key tumor suppressor \nmiRNA (tsmiR) that controls important oncogenes, such as MYC and RAS. In this \nstudy, in vitro studies were performed to show the control of MYC and RAS by \nmiR-145. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell proliferation and apoptosis. \nThe efficacy of miR-145 in treating metastatic PCa was tested in nude mice using \na model of bone metastasis promoted by intraventricular injection of PC-3MLuc-C6 \ncells. Tumor growth was evaluated by an in vivo bioluminescence system. After \nthe full establishment of metastases on day 21, six animals were treated with \nthree intravenous doses of miR-145 (on days 21, 24 and 27), and six were \ninjected with scramble miRNA as controls. Compared to the controls, tumor growth \nwas significantly reduced in animals receiving miR-145, most importantly on day \n7 after the third and last dose of miRNA. After discontinuing the treatment, \ntumor growth resumed, becoming similar to the group of non-treated animals. A \ndecrease in MYC and RAS expression was observed in all cell lines after \ntreatment with miR-145, although statistical significance was achieved only in \nexperiments with LNCaP and PC3 cell lines, with a decrease in 56% (p = 0.012) \nand 31% (p = 0.013) of RAS expression, respectively. Our results suggest that \nmiR-145 is a potential molecule to be tested for treatment of metastatic, \ncastration-resistant PCa.",

However, the relevance of the Warburg effect for the inherent \nresistance to apoptosis of cancer cells has received much less attention. Here, \nwe show here that the Warburg effect modulates the extracellular \nlactate-to-pyruvate ratio, which profoundly regulates the sensitivity towards \napoptosis induced by oxidative stress in several cell lines. To induce oxidative \nstress, we used the rapid apoptosis inducer Raptinal. We observed that medium \nconditioned by HepG2 cells has a high lactate-to-pyruvate ratio and confers \nresistance to Raptinal-induced apoptosis. In addition, imposing a high \nextracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in media reduces the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ \nredox state and protects against Raptinal-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a low \nextracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio oxidizes the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ redox \nstate and sensitizes HepG2 cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. \nMechanistically, a high extracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio decreases the \nactivation of JNK and Bax under oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting the \nintrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our observations demonstrate that the Warburg \neffect of cancer cells generates an anti-apoptotic extracellular environment by \nelevating the extracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio which desensitizes cancer \ncells towards apoptotic insults. Consequently, our study suggests that the \nWarburg effect can be targeted to reverse the lactate-to-pyruvate ratios in the \ntumor microenvironment and thereby re-sensitize cancer cells to oxidative \nstress-inducing therapies.",

Mechanistic studies revealed that ARID1A blocked the \ninteraction between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and retinoblastoma protein \n(Rb), reducing the phosphorylation of Rb.

Among all approaches, a messenger \nRNA (mRNA)-based vaccine has emerged as a rapid and versatile platform to \nquickly respond to this challenge. Here, we developed a lipid \nnanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the receptor binding domain \n(RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate (called ARCoV). Intramuscular \nimmunization of ARCoV mRNA-LNP elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against \nSARS-CoV-2 as well as a Th1-biased cellular response in mice and non-human \nprimates. Two doses of ARCoV immunization in mice conferred complete protection \nagainst the challenge of a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain. Additionally, ARCoV \nis manufactured as a liquid formulation and can be stored at room temperature \nfor at least 1 week. ARCoV is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical \ntrials.",

SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks human \nalveoli and causes severe lung infection and damage. To better understand the \nmolecular basis of this disease, we sought to characterize the responses of \nalveolar epithelium and its adjacent microvascular endothelium to viral \ninfection under a co-culture system. SARS-CoV-2 infection caused massive virus \nreplication and dramatic organelles remodeling in alveolar epithelial cells, \nalone. While, viral infection affected endothelial cells in an indirect manner, \nwhich was mediated by infected alveolar epithelium. Proteomics analysis and TEM \nexaminations showed viral infection caused global proteomic modulations and \nmarked ultrastructural changes in both epithelial cells and endothelial cells \nunder the co-culture system. In particular, viral infection elicited global \nprotein changes and structural reorganizations across many sub-cellular \ncompartments in epithelial cells. Among the affected organelles, mitochondrion \nseems to be a primary target organelle. Besides, according to EM and proteomic \nresults, we identified Daurisoline, a potent autophagy inhibitor, could inhibit \nvirus replication effectively in host cells. Collectively, our study revealed an \nunrecognized cross-talk between epithelium and endothelium, which contributed to \nalveolar-capillary injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These new findings will \nexpand our understanding of COVID-19 and may also be helpful for targeted drug \ndevelopment.",

It induces apoptotic cell death \nin various cell types, but very little is known about the mechanism involved in \nthe process. Here, we used budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to \nstudy the involvement of some key elements of apoptosis in the anacardic \nacid-induced cell death. Plasma membrane constriction, chromatin condensation, \nDNA degradation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) indicated that \nanacardic acid induces apoptotic cell death in S. cerevisiae. However, the \nexogenous addition of broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or deletion of \nthe yeast caspase Yca1 showed that the anacardic acid-induced cell death is \ncaspase independent. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF1) deletion mutant was \nresistant to the anacardic acid-induced cell death, suggesting a key role of \nAif1. Overexpression of Aif1 made cells highly susceptible to anacardic acid, \nfurther confirming that Aif1 mediates anacardic acid-induced apoptosis. \nInterestingly, instead of the increase in the intracellular reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) normally observed during apoptosis, anacardic acid caused a \ndecrease in the intracellular ROS levels. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis \nshowed downregulation of the BIR1 survivin mRNA expression during the anacardic \nacid-induced apoptosis.",

EZH2 expression results in the \nsilencing of genes that suppress tumor formation and metastasis through \ntrimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at their promoters. \nHowever, inhibitors of EZH2 enzymatic activity have not shown the expected \nefficacy against cancer in clinical trials, suggesting a need for other \nstrategies to address EZH2 overexpression. Here, we show that SUMOylation, a \nposttranslational modification characterized by covalent attachment of small \nubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to a lysine (Lys) residue on target \nproteins, enhances EZH2 transcription. Either knockdown of the SUMO-activating \nenzyme SAE2 or pharmacologic inhibition of SUMOylation resulted in decreased \nlevels of EZH2 mRNA and protein as well as reduced H3K27me3 levels. SUMOylation \nregulated EZH2 expression by enhancing binding of the E2F1 transcriptional \nactivator to the EZH2 promoter. Inhibition of SUMOylation not only resulted in \nreduced EZH2 mRNA and protein levels but also increased expression of genes \nsilenced by EZH2, such as E-cadherin, which suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal \ntransition and metastasis. In more than 6,500 patient tumor samples across \ndifferent cancer types, expression of UBA2 and EZH2 was positively correlated. \nTaken together, our findings suggest that inhibition of SUMOylation may serve as \na potential strategy to address EZH2 overexpression and improve current cancer \ntherapeutic approaches.",

            "TEXT": "Senescent Stromal Cells Promote Cancer Resistance through SIRT1 Loss-Potentiated \nOverproduction of Small Extracellular Vesicles.\n\nCellular senescence is a potent tumor-suppressive program that prevents \nneoplastic events. Paradoxically, senescent cells develop an inflammatory \nsecretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which is \nimplicated in age-related pathologies including cancer. Here, we report that \nsenescent cells actively synthesize and release small extracellular vesicles \n(sEV) with a distinctive size distribution. Mechanistically, SIRT1 loss \nsupported accelerated sEV production despite enhanced proteome-wide \nubiquitination, a process correlated with ATP6V1A downregulation and defective \nlysosomal acidification. Once released, senescent stromal sEVs significantly \naltered the expression profile of recipient cancer cells and enhanced their \naggressiveness, specifically drug resistance mediated by expression of \nATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4). Targeting SIRT1 with agonist \nSRT2104 prevented development of cancer resistance by restraining sEV production \nby senescent stromal cells. In clinical oncology, sEVs in peripheral blood of \nposttreatment cancer patients were readily detectable by routine biotechniques, \npresenting an exploitable biomarker to monitor therapeutic efficacy and predict \nlong-term outcome. Together, this study identifies a distinct mechanism \nsupporting pathologic activities of senescent cells and provides a potent avenue \nto circumvent advanced human malignancies by cotargeting cancer cells and their \nsurrounding microenvironment, which contributes to drug resistance via secretion \nof sEVs from senescent stromal cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Senescent stromal cells \nproduce a large number of sEVs to promote cancer resistance in therapeutic \nsettings, a process driven by SIRT1 decline in stromal cells and ABCB4 \naugmentation in cancer cells.",

In the \npresent study, we reported the discovery of a novel ferroptosis inducer, \ntalaroconvolutin A (TalaA), and the underlying molecular mechanism. We \ndiscovered that TalaA killed colorectal cancer cells in dose-dependent and \ntime-dependent manners. Interestingly, TalaA did not induce apoptosis, but \nstrongly triggered ferroptosis.

We revealed a dual mechanism of TalaA' action against \ncancer. On the one hand, TalaA considerably increased reactive oxygen species \nlevels to a certain threshold, the exceeding of which induced ferroptosis. On \nthe other hand, this compound downregulated the expression of the channel \nprotein solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) but upregulated arachidonate \nlipoxygenase 3 (ALOXE3), promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments \nin mice evidenced that TalaA effectively suppressed the growth of xenografted \ncolorectal cancer cells without obvious liver and kidney toxicities.

Paradoxically, senescent cells secrete proinflammatory and \ngrowth-stimulatory molecules, termed the senescence-associated secretory \nphenotype (SASP), which is correlated with cancer cell proliferation in culture \nand xenograft models. However, at what tumor stage and how senescence and the \nSASP act on endogenous tumor growth in vivo is unknown. To understand the role \nof senescence in cancer etiology, we subjected p16-3MR transgenic mice, which \npermit the identification and selective elimination of senescent cells in vivo, \nto the well-established two-step protocol of squamous cell skin carcinoma, in \nwhich tumorigenesis is initiated by a carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene, \nand then promoted by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We show that \nTPA promotes skin carcinogenesis by inducing senescence and a SASP. Systemic \ninduction of senescence in nontumor-bearing p16-3MR mice using a chemotherapy \nfollowed by the two-step carcinogenesis protocol potentiated the conversion of \nbenign papillomas to carcinomas by elevating p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK signaling. \nAblation of senescent cells reduced p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK signaling, thereby \npreventing the progression of benign papillomas to carcinomas. Thus, we show for \nthe first time that senescent cells are tumor promoters, not tumor initiators, \nand that they stimulate skin carcinogenesis by elevating p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK \nsignaling. These findings pave the way for developing novel therapeutics against \nsenescence-fueled cancers.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of PARP1 require \nfurther study. WWP2, a HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, is highly expressed in the \nheart, but its function there is largely unknown. Here, we clarified the role of \nWWP2 in the regulation of PARP1 and the impact of this regulatory process on \ncardiac remodeling. We determined that the knockout of WWP2 specifically in \nmyocardium decreased the level of PARP1 ubiquitination and increased the effects \nof isoproterenol (ISO)-induced PARP1 and PARylation, in turn aggravating \nISO-induced myocardial hypertrophy, heart failure, and myocardial fibrosis. \nSimilar findings were obtained in a model of ISO-induced H9c2 cells with WWP2 \nknockdown, while the reexpression of WWP2 significantly increased PARP1 \nubiquitination and decreased PAPR1 and PARylation levels. Mechanistically, \ncoimmunoprecipitation results identified that WWP2 is a novel interacting \nprotein of PARP1 and mainly interacts with its BRCT domain, thus mediating the \ndegradation of PARP1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In addition, \nlysine 418 (K418) and lysine 249 (K249) were shown to be of critical importance \nin regulating PARP1 ubiquitination and degradation by WWP2. These findings \nreveal a novel WWP2-PARP1 signal transduction pathway involved in controlling \ncardiac remodeling and may provide a basis for exploring new strategies for \ntreating heart disorders related to cardiac remodeling.",

Here, we report a novel mechanism that \ncontributes to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity through the induction of \nferroptosis, a distinctive form of programmed cell death. We subsequently \nidentified therapies protective against acetaminophen-induced liver damage and \nfound that (+)-clausenamide ((+)-CLA), an active alkaloid isolated from the \nleaves of Clausena lansium (Lour.)

In contrast to such notion, here \nwe show-in many cancer cell types-MTAs function by triggering membrane TNF \n(memTNF)-mediated cancer-cell-to-cancer-cell killing, which differs greatly from \nother non-MTA cell-cycle-arresting agents. The killing is through programmed \ncell death (PCD), either in way of necroptosis when RIP3 kinase is expressed, or \nof apoptosis in its absence. Mechanistically, MTAs induce memTNF transcription \nvia the JNK-cJun signaling pathway. With respect to chemotherapy regimens, our \nresults establish that memTNF-mediated killing is significantly augmented by IAP \nantagonists (Smac mimetics) in a broad spectrum of cancer types, and with their \neffects most prominently manifested in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in \nwhich cell-cell contacts are highly reminiscent of human tumors. Therefore, our \nfinding indicates that memTNF can serve as a marker for patient responsiveness, \nand Smac mimetics will be effective adjuvants for MTA chemotherapeutics.

Long \nnoncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in inflammation, but the exact mechanism in \natherosclerosis is unclear. Our microarray analyses revealed that the levels of \nlncRNA-FA2H-2 were significantly decreased by oxidized low-density lipoprotein \n(OX-LDL). Bioinformatics analyses indicated that mixed lineage kinase \ndomain-like protein (MLKL) might be regulated by lncRNA-FA2H-2. In vitro \nexperiments showed that lncRNA-FA2H-2 interacted with the promoter of the MLKL \ngene, downregulated MLKL expression, and the binding sites between -750 and 471 \nwere necessary for lncRNA-FA2H-2 responsiveness to MLKL. Silencing lncRNA-FA2H-2 \nand overexpression of MLKL could activate inflammation and inhibited autophagy \nflux. Both lncRNA-FA2H-2 knockdown and overexpression of MLKL could \nsignificantly aggravate inflammatory responses induced by OX-LDL. We found that \nthe 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Atg7-shRNA enhanced inflammatory responses \ninduced by knockdown of lncRNA-FA2H-2 and overexpression of MLKL. We \ndemonstrated that the effects of MLKL on autophagy might be associated with a \nmechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling pathways.

            "TEXT": "Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency inhibits lysosomal hydrolysis.\n\nMitochondria are key organelles for cellular metabolism, and regulate several \nprocesses including cell death and macroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that \nmitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) deficiency deactivates AMP-activated \nprotein kinase (AMPK, a key regulator of energy homeostasis) signaling in tissue \nand in cultured cells. The deactivation of AMPK in RC-deficiency is due to \nincreased expression of the AMPK-inhibiting protein FLCN (folliculin). AMPK is \nfound to be necessary for basal lysosomal function, and AMPK deactivation in \nRC-deficiency inhibits lysosomal function by decreasing the activity of the \nlysosomal Ca2+ channel MCOLN1 (mucolipin 1). MCOLN1 is regulated by \nphosphoinositide kinase PIKFYVE and its product PtdIns(3,5)P2, which is also \ndecreased in RC-deficiency. Notably, reactivation of AMPK, in a \nPIKFYVE-dependent manner, or of MCOLN1 in RC-deficient cells, restores lysosomal \nhydrolytic capacity. Building on these data and the literature, we propose that \ndownregulation of the AMPK-PIKFYVE-PtdIns(3,5)P2-MCOLN1 pathway causes lysosomal \nCa2+ accumulation and impaired lysosomal catabolism. Besides unveiling a novel \nrole of AMPK in lysosomal function, this study points to the mechanism that \nlinks mitochondrial malfunction to impaired lysosomal catabolism, underscoring \nthe importance of AMPK and the complexity of organelle cross-talk in the \nregulation of cellular homeostasis.",

            "TEXT": "Distinct roles of BRCA2 in replication fork protection in response to \nhydroxyurea and DNA interstrand cross-links.\n\nDNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) are a form of DNA damage that requires the \ninterplay of a number of repair proteins including those of the Fanconi anemia \n(FA) and the homologous recombination (HR) pathways. Pathogenic variants in the \nessential gene BRCA2/FANCD1, when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian \ncancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 \nfunction in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 \nrecombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and \nRAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from \nnucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has \nbeen shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant \nnuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. \nHere, based on the analysis of BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants \n(c.8488-1G>A and c.8524C>T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical \nFA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of \nDNA at ICLs. Cells carrying BRCA2 DBD mutations are sensitive to ICL-inducing \nagents but resistant to HU treatment consistent with relatively high HR repair \nin these cells. BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN \nnuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the \nresection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate \nthat unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 \ntranslocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not \nan integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of \nfork protection at different DNA lesions.",

However, \nit is still unknown whether circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of \nendogenous noncoding RNAs, participate in the regulation of this progress. In \nthis study, we explored the expression profiles of circRNAs in three paired \nsamples of ESCC and identified cCNTNAP3, which is a circRNA that originates from \nthe CNTNAP3 gene transcript and is highly expressed in normal human esophageal \ntissue. However, we found that the cCNTNAP3 expression level was significantly \ndownregulated in ESCC tissues. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that \ncCNTNAP3 inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in p53 wild-type ESCC \ncells, but not in mutant cells. Mechanistically, we found that cCNTNAP3 promotes \nthe expression of p53 by sponging miR-513a-5p. Rescue assay confirmed that the \nsuppressive function of cCNTNAP3 was dependent on miR-513a-5p. We also observed \nthat p53/RBM25 participated in the formation of cCNTNAP3, which implied the \nexistence of a positive feedback loop between cCNTNAP3 and p53. Furthermore, the \ndownregulation of cCNTNAP3 was significantly correlated with later T stage and \nthus can serve as an independent risk factor for the overall survival of \npatients with p53 wild-type ESCC. In conclusion, the cCNTNAP3-TP53 positive \nfeedback loop may provide a potential target for the management of ESCC, which \nalso reveals the important role of circRNAs in the regulation of p53.",

Conditional deletion of Hippo pathway kinases, Lats1 \nand Lats2, in uninjured CFs initiated a self-perpetuating fibrotic response in \nthe adult heart that was exacerbated by myocardial infarction (MI).

            "TEXT": "REDD1 loss reprograms lipid metabolism to drive progression of RAS mutant \ntumors.\n\nHuman cancers with activating RAS mutations are typically highly aggressive and \ntreatment-refractory, yet RAS mutation itself is insufficient for tumorigenesis, \ndue in part to profound metabolic stress induced by RAS activation. Here we show \nthat loss of REDD1, a stress-induced metabolic regulator, is sufficient to \nreprogram lipid metabolism and drive progression of RAS mutant cancers. Redd1 \ndeletion in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of KRAS-dependent \npancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas converts preneoplastic lesions into invasive \nand metastatic carcinomas. Metabolic profiling reveals that REDD1-deficient/RAS \nmutant cells exhibit enhanced uptake of lysophospholipids and lipid storage, \ncoupled to augmented fatty acid oxidation that sustains both ATP levels and \nROS-detoxifying NADPH. Mechanistically, REDD1 loss triggers HIF-dependent \nactivation of a lipid storage pathway involving PPARγ and the prometastatic \nfactor CD36. Correspondingly, decreased REDD1 expression and a signature of \nREDD1 loss predict poor outcomes selectively in RAS mutant but not RAS wild-type \nhuman lung and pancreas carcinomas. Collectively, our findings reveal the \nREDD1-mediated stress response as a novel tumor suppressor whose loss defines a \nRAS mutant tumor subset characterized by reprogramming of lipid metabolism, \ninvasive and metastatic progression, and poor prognosis. This work thus provides \nnew mechanistic and clinically relevant insights into the phenotypic \nheterogeneity and metabolic rewiring that underlies these common cancers.",

SQSTM1/p62 is a prototype autophagy receptor, which is \ncommonly found in protein aggregates associated with major neurodegenerative \ndiseases.

Our data demonstrates that proteotoxic stress activates \nserine/threonine kinase TBK1, which coordinates with autophagy kinase ULK1 to \npromote concerted phosphorylation of autophagy receptor SQSTM1 at the UBA domain \nand activation of selective autophagy. In contrast, ALS-FTLD-linked mutations of \nTBK1 or SQSTM1 reduce SQSTM1 phosphorylation and compromise ubiquitinated cargo \nbinding and clearance. Moreover, disease mutation SQSTM1G427R abolishes \nphosphorylation of Ser351 and impairs KEAP1-SQSTM1 interaction, thus diminishing \nNFE2L2/Nrf2-targeted gene expression and increasing TARDBP/TDP-43 associated \nstress granule formation under oxidative stress.

In our previous \nstudy, long noncoding RNA CERNA1 was identified both located in cytoplasm and \nnucleus of vascular endothelial cells (VECs). And CERNA1 in cytoplasm, which \nfunctioned as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), alleviated the apoptosis of \nVECs. However, the function of CERNA1 in nucleus was still unclear. In this \nstudy, we found that nuclear CERNA1 positively regulated BCL2L10, which \naccelerated the serum and FGF-2 starvation-induced apoptosis of VECs, by \nenhancing the histone modification level of H3K9ac and H3K4me3 in BCL2L10 \npromoter region. Furthermore, due to the paradoxical function, we investigated \nthe variation of CERNA1 subcellular location in VECs. The results showed that, \nas the change of apoptosis status, CERNA1 altered the cellular distribution in \nVECs. And the annexin A7 inhibitor, ABO \n(6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine), not only increased the \nexpression of CERNA1 by TIA-1, but also specifically improved its cytoplasm \ndistribution proportion so as to inhibit the apoptosis of VECs. This evidence \nsuggested that the subcellular location of CERNA1 played an important role in \nthe VECs apoptosis and ABO might be a potential chemical molecule for therapy of \nVECs apoptosis related cardiovascular diseases.",

AMBRA1 is a mitophagy receptor for the selective removal of \ndamaged mitochondria in mammalian cells. A critical unresolved issue is how \nAMBRA1-mediated mitophagy is controlled in response to cellular stress. Here, we \ninvestigated the role of BCL2-family proteins on AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy and \nshowed that MCL1 delays AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy. Indeed, MCL1 overexpression \nis sufficient to inhibit recruitment to mitochondria of the E3 Ubiquitin ligase \nHUWE1, a crucial dynamic partner of AMBRA1, upon AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy \ninduction. In addition, we found that during mitophagy induced by AMBRA1, MCL1 \nlevels decreased but were sustained by inhibition of the GSK-3β kinase, which \ndelayed AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Also, we showed that MCL1 was phosphorylated \nby GSK-3β at a conserved GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S159) during \nAMBRA1-mediated mitophagy and that this event was accompanied by HUWE1-dependent \nMCL1 degradation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that MCL1 stability is \nregulated by the kinase GSK-3β and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 in regulating \nAMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Our work thus defines MCL1 as an upstream \nstress-sensitive protein, functional in AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy.",

Xc- is a \nsodium-independent antiporter passively driven by concentration gradients from \nextracellular cystine and intracellular glutamate across the cell membrane. \nIncreased uptake of cystine via Xc- in cancer cells increases the level of \nextracellular glutamate, which would subsequently restrain cystine uptake via \nXc-.

In this study, we report that glutamate transporters, in \nparticular SLC1A1, are tightly intertwined with cystine uptake and GSH \nbiosynthesis in lung cancer cells. Dysregulated SLC1A1, a sodium-dependent \nglutamate carrier, actively recycled extracellular glutamate into cells, which \nenhanced the efficiency of cystine uptake via Xc- and GSH biosynthesis as \nmeasured by stable isotope-assisted metabolomics. Conversely, depletion of \nglutamate transporter SLC1A1 increased extracellular glutamate, which inhibited \ncystine uptake, blocked GSH synthesis, and induced oxidative stress-mediated \ncell death or growth inhibition. Moreover, glutamate transporters were \nfrequently upregulated in tissue samples of patients with non-small cell lung \ncancer.

Myofibroblasts induced by TGFβ1 and \nother factors are key players in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and tumor. \nTremendous attention has been gained to targeting myofibroblasts in order to \ninhibit the progression of fibrosis and myofibroblast-induced tumor progression \nand metastasis. Here we determined the therapeutic efficacy of simultaneously \ntargeting PI3K and HDAC pathways in lung myofibroblasts and CAF with a single \nagent and to evaluate biomarkers of treatment response. CUDC-907 is a \nfirst-in-class compound, functioning as a dual inhibitor of HDACs and PI3K/AKT \npathway. We investigated its effects in counteracting the activity of \nTGFβ1-induced myofibroblasts/CAF in regard to cell proliferation, migration, \ninvasion, apoptosis in vitro antifibrosis efficiency in vivo. We found that \nCUDC-907 inhibited myofibroblasts/CAF cell proliferation, migration and \napoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and caused cell cycle arrest at G1-S phase. \nCUDC-907 not only inhibited myofibroblasts markers expression, but also \nsignificantly inhibited the phosphorylation level of AKT, mTOR, Smad2/3, and \npromoted acetylation of histones. Furthermore, the observed inhibitory effect \nwas also confirmed in bleomycin-induced mice lung fibrosis and nude mouse \ntransplanted tumor model. Overall, these data suggest that dual inhibition of \nHDAC and the tyrosine kinase signaling pathways with CUDC-907 is a promising \ntreatment strategy for TGFβ1-induced lung and tumor fibrosis.",

Endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) is an organelle responsible for protein modification, quality \ncontrol, and transportation. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins \nin ER cavity induces ER stress.

In this study, we found that PERK was \nsignificantly activated during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation; \nknockdown of PERK by siRNA and inhibition of PERK by GSK2606414, respectively, \nhad significant negative regulatory effects on the formation and bone resorption \nof osteoclasts.

It has been perplexing as to why both enzymatically \nactivating and inactivating mutations in PTPN11 result in human developmental \ndisorders with overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we uncover a common \nliquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior shared by these \ndisease-associated SHP2 mutants. SHP2 LLPS is mediated by the conserved \nwell-folded PTP domain through multivalent electrostatic interactions and \nregulated by an intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanism through conformational \nchanges. SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of SHP2 mutants, which \nboosts SHP2 PTP activity. Moreover, disease-associated SHP2 mutants can recruit \nand activate wild-type (WT) SHP2 in LLPS to promote MAPK activation. These \nresults not only suggest that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism \ninvolved in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases but also provide \nevidence that PTP may be regulated by LLPS that can be therapeutically targeted.",

In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a \ndosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar \nataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential \nto prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely \nunknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1's unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' \nUTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. \nBased on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' \nUTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator \nthat binds to a conserved site in ATXN1's 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and \ntranslational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus \n(AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and \nmitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings \nprovide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional \nevidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the \npossibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors \nfor yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.",

However acquired resistance to paclitaxel, epithelial \nto mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell formation are the major obstacles \nfor successful chemotherapy with this drug. Some of the major reasons behind \nchemoresistance development include increased ability of the cancer cells to \nsurvive under stress conditions by autophagy, increased expression of drug \nefflux pumps, tubulin mutations etc. In this study we found that inhibition of \nautophagy with chloroquine prevented development of paclitaxel resistance in \nA549 cells with time and potentiated the effect of paclitaxel by increased \naccumulation of superoxide-producing damaged mitochondria, with elevated ROS \ngeneration, it also increased the apoptotic rate and sub G0/ G1 phase arrest \nwith time in A549 cells treated with paclitaxel and attenuated the metastatic \npotential and cancer stem cell population of the paclitaxel-resistant cells by \nROS mediated modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby \nincreasing paclitaxel sensitivity. ROS here played a crucial role in modulating \nAkt activity when autophagy process was hindered by chloroquine, excessive ROS \naccumulation in the cell inhibited Akt activity. In addition, chloroquine \npre-treatment followed by taxol (10 nM) treatment did not show significant \ntoxicity towards non-carcinomas WI38 cells (lung fibroblast cells). Thus \nautophagy inhibition by CQ pre-treatment can be used as a fruitful strategy to \ncombat the phenomenon of paclitaxel resistance development as well as metastasis \nin lung cancer.",

Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) \nassay showed that ORI/Cet significantly increased the binding NF-κB family \nmember p65 with the promotor of BECN 1, and p65-mediated up-regulation of BECN 1 \ncaused by ORI/Cet is coupled to increased autophagy. On the other hand, we \ndemonstrated that either Beclin 1 SiRNA or autophagy inhibitors could increase \nORI/Cet induced-apoptosis, indicating that autophagy induced by combination of \nthe two agents plays a cytoprotective role. Interestingly, 48 h after the \ncombined treatment, autophagy began to decrease but apoptosis was significantly \nelevated. Our findings suggest that autophagy might be strongly associated with \nthe antitumor efficacy of ORI/Cet, which may be beneficial to the clinical \napplication of ORI/Cet in LSCC treatment.",

Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow \nbiopsies from most of these patients revealed aberrant expression of BCL6, a \ntranscription factor that promotes oncogenic B-cell transformation and drug \nresistance in B-ALL. Our genetic and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation \n[ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) analyses showed that MLL-AF4 \nand MLL-ENL fusions directly bound to the BCL6 promoter and up-regulated BCL6 \nexpression. While oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced aberrant BCL6 \nexpression in B-ALL cells, germline MLL was required to up-regulate Bcl6 in \nresponse to physiological stimuli during normal B-cell development. Inducible \nexpression of Bcl6 increased MLL mRNA levels, which was reversed by genetic \ndeletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bcl6, suggesting a positive feedback \nloop between MLL and BCL6. Highlighting the central role of BCL6 in \nMLL-rearranged B-ALL, conditional deletion and pharmacological inhibition of \nBCL6 compromised leukemogenesis in transplant recipient mice and restored \nsensitivity to vincristine chemotherapy in MLL-rearranged B-ALL patient samples. \nOncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced transcriptional activation of the \nproapoptotic BH3-only molecule BIM, while BCL6 was required to curb MLL-induced \nexpression of BIM. Notably, peptide (RI-BPI) and small molecule (FX1) BCL6 \ninhibitors derepressed BIM and synergized with the BH3-mimetic ABT-199 in \neradicating MLL-rearranged B-ALL cells. These findings uncover MLL-dependent \ntranscriptional activation of BCL6 as a previously unrecognized requirement of \nmalignant transformation by oncogenic MLL fusions and identified BCL6 as a novel \ntarget for the treatment of MLL-rearranged B-ALL.",

Although Wnt signaling \nhas been intensively studied in colorectal cancer, it remains unclear whether \nactivity in the tumor-associated stroma contributes to malignancy. To \nspecifically interfere with stromal signals, we generated Wnt-independent tumor \norganoids that secrete the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1. Subcutaneous transplantation \ninto immunocompetent as well as immunodeficient mice resulted in a strong \nreduction of tumor growth. Histologic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that \nSfrp1 induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in tumor \ncells without affecting tumor-intrinsic Wnt signaling, suggesting involvement of \nnonimmune stromal cells. Blockage of canonical signaling using Sfrp1, Dkk1, or \nfibroblast-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin strongly decreased the number \nof cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAF). Wnt activity in CAFs was linked \nwith distinct subtypes, where low and high levels induced an inflammatory-like \nCAF (iCAF) subtype or contractile myCAFs, respectively. Coculture of tumor \norganoids with iCAFs resulted in significant upregulation of EMT markers, while \nmyCAFs reverted this phenotype.

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers lipid \ndroplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or \nmacroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase, regulates the \nacetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy \nmetabolism. However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. \nThe current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the \nmacroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high-fat diet \nfed mice and P/O (palmitic acid and oleic acid mixture) treated AML12 mouse \nhepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression \npromoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating \nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs \ndigestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of \nlysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa \nprotein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce \nthe stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of \nstearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis.

Therefore, the identification of \nfactors critical for BCSC function is vital for the development of therapies. \nHere, we report that DNMT1-mediated FOXO3a promoter hypermethylation leads to \ndownregulation of FOXO3a expression in breast cancer. FOXO3a is functionally \nrelated to the inhibition of FOXM1/SOX2 signaling and to the consequent \nsuppression of BCSCs properties and tumorigenicity.

Inhibition of DNMT \nactivity suppressed tumor growth via regulation of FOXO3a/FOXM1/SOX2 signaling \nin breast cancer. Clinically, we observed a significant inverse correlation \nbetween FOXO3a and FOXM1/SOX2/DNMT1 expression levels, and loss of FOXO3a \nexpression or increased expression of FOXM1, SOX2, and DNMT1 predicted poor \nprognosis in breast cancer.

In \nvivo PET imaging with 18F-ML-10 and 18F-ML-8 was performed in the MI models at \ndifferent time points after operation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase \ndUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays and immunohistochemical analyses were used \nto evaluate myocardial apoptosis. In vitro cell binding assays were performed to \nvalidate 18F-ML-8 binding to apoptotic cardiomyocytes. PET imaging demonstrated \nhigh 18F-ML-10 and 18F-ML-8 uptake where 18F-FDG uptake was absent. The focal \naccumulation of the two tracers was high on days 1 and 3 but was not notable on \ndays 5 and 7 after surgery. The infarct-to-lung uptake ratio was 4.29 ± 0.30 for \n18F-ML-10 and 3.51 ± 0.18 for 18F-ML-8 (n = 6, analyzed by averaging the uptake \nratios on postoperative days 1 and 3, P < 0.05). The TUNEL results showed that \nmyocardial cell apoptosis was closely related to the focal uptake of the \napoptotic tracers in the infarct area. In addition, the apoptosis rates \ncalculated from the TUNEL results were better correlated with 18F-ML-8 uptake \nthan with 18F-ML-10 uptake. Ex vivo cell binding assays demonstrated that \n18F-ML-8 accumulated in apoptotic cells but not in necrotic or normal cells. PET \nimaging using 18F-ML-10 or 18F-ML-8 allows the noninvasive detection of \nmyocardial apoptosis in the early phase. In addition, 18F-ML-8 may be better \nthan 18F-ML-10 for apoptosis imaging.

            "TEXT": "Allosteric SHP2 Inhibitor, IACS-13909, Overcomes EGFR-Dependent and \nEGFR-Independent Resistance Mechanisms toward Osimertinib.\n\nSrc homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase (SHP2) is a phosphatase that \nmediates signaling downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and is \nrequired for full activation of the MAPK pathway. SHP2 inhibition has \ndemonstrated tumor growth inhibition in RTK-activated cancers in preclinical \nstudies. The long-term effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as the \nEGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), osimertinib, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is \nlimited by acquired resistance. Multiple clinically identified mechanisms \nunderlie resistance to osimertinib, including mutations in EGFR that preclude \ndrug binding as well as EGFR-independent activation of the MAPK pathway through \nalternate RTK (RTK-bypass). It has also been noted that frequently a tumor from \na single patient harbors more than one resistance mechanism, and the plasticity \nbetween multiple resistance mechanisms could restrict the effectiveness of \ntherapies targeting a single node of the oncogenic signaling network. Here, we \nreport the discovery of IACS-13909, a specific and potent allosteric inhibitor \nof SHP2, that suppresses signaling through the MAPK pathway. IACS-13909 potently \nimpeded proliferation of tumors harboring a broad spectrum of activated RTKs as \nthe oncogenic driver. In EGFR-mutant osimertinib-resistant NSCLC models with \nEGFR-dependent and EGFR-independent resistance mechanisms, IACS-13909, \nadministered as a single agent or in combination with osimertinib, potently \nsuppressed tumor cell proliferation in vitro and caused tumor regression in \nvivo. Together, our findings provide preclinical evidence for using a SHP2 \ninhibitor as a therapeutic strategy in acquired EGFRi-resistant NSCLC.",

There has been some success treating RICD in rodents \nusing human neural stem cell (hNSC) transplantation, but the procedure is \ninvasive, requires immunosuppression, and could cause other complications such \nas teratoma formation. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nanoscale membrane-bound \nstructures that contain biological contents including mRNA, miRNA, proteins, and \nlipids that can be readily isolated from conditioned culture media. It has been \npreviously shown that hNSC-derived EV resolves RICD following cranial \nirradiation using an immunocompromised rodent model. Here, we use \nimmunocompetent wild-type mice to show that hNSC-derived EV treatment \nadministered either intravenously via retro-orbital vein injection or via \nintracranial transplantation can ameliorate cognitive deficits following 9 Gy \nhead-only irradiation. Cognitive function assessed on the novel place \nrecognition, novel object recognition, and temporal order tasks was not only \nimproved at early (5 weeks) but also at delayed (6 months) postirradiation times \nwith just a single EV treatment. Improved behavioral outcomes were also \nassociated with reduced neuroinflammation as measured by a reduction in \nactivated microglia. To identify the mechanism of action, analysis of EV cargo \nimplicated miRNA (miR-124) as a potential candidate in the mitigation of RICD. \nFurthermore, viral vector-mediated overexpression of miR-124 in the irradiated \nbrain ameliorated RICD and reduced microglial activation. Our findings \ndemonstrate for the first time that systemic administration of hNSC-derived EV \nabrogates RICD and neuroinflammation in cranially irradiated wild-type rodents \nthrough a mechanism involving miR-124.",

For instance, a considerable challenge for the treatment of HCC is \nsorafenib resistance. The aberrant glucose metabolism in cancer cells aerobic \nglycolysis is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. \nDrug-resistance cells and tumors were exposed to sorafenib to establish \nsorafenib-resistance cell lines and tumors. Western blotting and real-time PCR \nor IHC staining were used to analyze the level of CLCF1 in the sorafenib \nresistance cell lines or tumors. The aerobic glycolysis was analyzed by ECAR \nassay. The mechanism mediating the high expression of CLCF1 in \nsorafenib-resistant cells and its relationships with miR-130-5p was determined \nby bioinformatic analysis, dual luciferase reporter assays, real-time PCR, and \nwestern blotting.

Furthermore, \nwe also show that miR-30a-5p directly targets CLCF1 and that sorafenib-mediated \nsuppression of miR-30a-5p results in the upregulation of CLCF1 in HCC cells \nresistant to sorafenib. We also found that when a cholesterol modified \nagomiR-30a-5p was delivered systemically to mice harboring sorafenib-resistant \nHCC tumors, tumor growth decreased significantly. There is an uncharacterized \nmechanism of biochemical resistance to hormone therapies orchestrated by the \nmiR-30a-5p/CLCF1 axis to mediate sorafenib resistance and aerobic glycolysis in \nHCC.

ULK1 functions as a protein complex by \ninteracting with ATG13, RB1CC1/FIP200, and ATG101. How the ULK1 complex is \nregulated to trigger autophagy induction remains unclear. In this study, we have \ndetermined roles of Atg8-family proteins (ATG8s) in regulating ULK1 activity and \nautophagy. Using human cells depleted of each subfamily of ATG8, we found that \nthe GABARAP subfamily positively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore and \nautophagosome formation in response to starvation. In contrast, the LC3 \nsubfamily negatively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore formation. By \nreconstituting ATG8-depleted cells with individual ATG8 members, we identified \nGABARAP and GABARAPL1 as positive and LC3B and LC3C as negative regulators of \nULK1 activity. To address the role of ATG8 binding to ULK1, we mutated the LIR \nof endogenous ULK1 to disrupt the ATG8-ULK1 interaction by genome editing. The \nmutation drastically reduced the activity of ULK1, autophagic degradation of \nSQSTM1, and phagophore formation in response to starvation.

We further show that regulation of \ndecapping by 4E-T participates in mRNA repression by the miRNA effector protein \nTNRC6B and that 4E-T overexpression interferes with tristetraprolin (TTP)- and \nNOT1-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, we postulate that 4E-T modulates 5'-to-3' decay \nby swapping the fate of a deadenylated mRNA from complete degradation to \nstorage.

            "TEXT": "Mille modis morimur: We die in a thousand ways.\n\nDying cells subjected to apoptotic programs are engulfed by neighboring cells or \nby professional phagocytes, without inflammation or immunological reactions in \nthe tissue where apoptosis takes place. Apoptotic cells release \ndanger-associated project signals to their neighbours, through different \nmolecular patterns, stimulate antigen production and immune responses. \nMicroenvironmental effects with several functional consequences indicate that \ncell death is a complex process and may take place in several ways. This idea is \nexpressed by the title of the Special Issue and by the title of the guest \neditorial \"Mille modis morimur\" meaning that not only multicellular organisms, \nbut also single cells may die in a thousand ways. This idea is demonstrated by \nthe papers serving as examples for cell death. Apoptosis was induced by clary \nsage oil in Candida cells. Heavy metal (Gd) induced cell motility and apoptosis \nwas found in mammalian cells. RNA oxidation enhanced the reversion frequency of \napoptosis in yeast mutants. The frequency of apoptotic micronucleus formation \nincreased in a concentration-dependent manner by methotrexate. The antioxidant \ncoenzyme Q10 protected renal proximal tubule cells against nicotine-induced \napoptosis. The synergy of 2-deoxy-D-glucose combined with berberine induced \nlysosome/autophagy. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be regulated by \nglucocorticoid receptor in collaboration with Bcl-2 family proteins in \ndeveloping T cells. Cylindrospermopsin induced biochemical changes led to \napoptosis in plants. Mechanisms of stress seriously impacted the risk of \napoptosis. Transcriptional control of apoptotic cell clearance was achieved by \nmacrophage nuclear receptors. Finally, the clinical aspects of apoptosis-induced \nlymphopenia were reviewed in sepsis and other severe injuries. These examples \nnot only support the view of many ways of cell death, but predict further \npotential ways to induce or reduce the risk of cell death.",

Here, we investigated the \nmechanism whereby long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces renal injury in \nmice. The C57BL/6 mice fed HFD for 16 weeks developed obesity, diabetes, and \nkidney dysfunction manifested by albuminuria and blood accumulation of BUN and \ncreatinine. The HFD-fed kidney showed marked glomerular and tubular injuries, \nincluding prominent defects in the glomerular filtration barrier and increased \ntubular cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, HFD feeding markedly increased \ntriglyceride and cholesterol contents in the kidney and activated lipogenic \npathways for cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis. HFD feeding also increased \noxidative stress and induced mitochondrial fission in tubular cells, thereby \nactivating the pro-apoptotic pathway. In HK-2 and mesangial cell cultures, high \nglucose, fatty acid, and TNF-α combination was able to activate the lipogenic \npathways, increase oxidative stress, promote mitochondrial fission, and activate \nthe pro-apoptotic pathway, all of which could be attenuated by an inhibitor that \ndepleted reactive oxygen species. Taken together, these observations suggest \nthat long-term HFD feeding causes kidney injury at least in part as a result of \ntissue lipid accumulation, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial \ndysfunction, which promote excess programmed cell death.",

            "TEXT": "Impact of elevated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-2 on the development and \ntreatment of MLL-AF9 AML in mice.\n\nMany acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) express high levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1, \nespecially after therapy. To test the impact of these anti-apoptotic proteins on \nAML development and treatment, we used haemopoietic reconstitution to generate \nMLL-AF9 AMLs expressing BCL-2 or Mcl-1 transgenes. AMLs with elevated BCL-2 or \nMCL-1 had a higher proportion of mature myeloid cells but, like conventional \nMLL-AF9 AMLs, were readily transplantable. Short-term cell lines established \nfrom multiple primary AMLs of each genotype were tested in vitro for \nsusceptibility to chemotherapeutics currently used for treating AML \n(daunorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine); the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib; \nCDK7/9 inhibitors; and BH3 mimetics, which bind and inhibit pro-survival \nproteins. The BH3 mimetics tested, alone and in combination with the other \ndrugs, were: ABT-737 which, like its clinical counterpart navitoclax, targets \nBCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W; BCL-2-specific ABT-199 (venetoclax); BCL-XL-specific \nA-1331852; and S63845, a new MCL-1-specific BH3 mimetic. As single agents, \ndaunorubicin and bortezomib had the greatest efficacy. Elevated MCL-1 or BCL-2 \nreduced sensitivity to daunorubicin but, surprisingly, not to bortezomib. MCL-1 \nmarkedly enhanced resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-199 but not S63845, and BCL-2 \nincreased resistance to S63845 but not to ABT-737 or ABT-199. Notable synergies \nwere achieved by combining BH3 mimetics with daunorubicin: S63845 increased the \nsensitivity of both MCL-1 and BCL-2 overexpressing MLL-AF9 AMLs, and ABT-737 \naided in killing those overexpressing BCL-2. Synergy between daunorubicin and \nABT-199 was also apparent in vivo, although not curative. Impressive synergistic \nresponses were achieved for human MLL-fusion AML cell lines treated with \ndaunorubicin plus either ABT-737, ABT-199 or S63845, and with ABT-199 plus \nS63845, with or without daunorubicin. Our data suggest that AML patients may \nbenefit from combining conventional cytotoxic drugs with BH3 mimetics targeting \nBCL-2 or MCL-1 or, if tolerated, both these agents.",

Most of our understanding of Hippo signaling pertains to its \ncytoplasmic regulation, but how the pathway is controlled in the nucleus remains \npoorly understood. Here we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by \nwhich CDK7 promotes Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization in the nucleus to sustain Hippo \npathway outputs. We found that a modular E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4DCAF12 \nbinds and targets Yki/Yap/Taz for ubiquitination and degradation, whereas CDK7 \nphosphorylates Yki/Yap/Taz at S169/S128/S90 to inhibit CRL4DCAF12 recruitment, \nleading to Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization. As a consequence, inactivation of CDK7 \nreduced organ size and inhibited tumor growth, which could be reversed by \nrestoring Yki/Yap activity. Our study identifies an unanticipated layer of Hippo \npathway regulation, defines a novel mechanism by which CDK7 regulates tissue \ngrowth, and implies CDK7 as a drug target for Yap/Taz-driven cancer.",

However, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) driven by aberrantly \nhigh EVI1 expression has very poor prognosis. To investigate the effects of \npost-translational modifications on EVI1 function, we carried out a mass \nspectrometry (MS) analysis of EVI1 in AML and detected dynamic phosphorylation \nat serine 436 (S436).

Although the role of \nlong noncoding RNA in regulating cell fate has received widespread attention, \nlong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can both regulate autophagy and apoptosis \nneed to be discovered. In this study, we identified that a small chemical \nmolecule, 3-benzyl-5-([2-nitrophenoxy] methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO), \nsynthesized by us, could inhibit VEC autophagy and apoptosis induced by a high \nconcentration of glucose.

            "TEXT": "Ischemia-induced ACSL4 activation contributes to ferroptosis-mediated tissue \ninjury in intestinal ischemia/reperfusion.\n\nFerroptosis is a recently identified form of regulated cell death defined by the \niron-dependent accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis has \nbeen studied in various diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, and \nstroke. However, the exact function and mechanism of ferroptosis in \nischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, especially in the intestine, remains unknown. \nConsidering the unique conditions required for ferroptosis, we hypothesize that \nischemia promotes ferroptosis immediately after intestinal reperfusion. In \ncontrast to conventional strategies employed in I/R studies, we focused on the \nischemic phase. Here we verified ferroptosis by assessing proferroptotic changes \nafter ischemia along with protein and lipid peroxidation levels during \nreperfusion. The inhibition of ferroptosis by liproxstatin-1 ameliorated \nI/R-induced intestinal injury. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 \n(ACSL4), which is a key enzyme that regulates lipid composition, has been shown \nto contribute to the execution of ferroptosis, but its role in I/R needs \nclarification. In the present study, we used rosiglitazone (ROSI) and siRNA to \ninhibit ischemia/hypoxia-induced ACSL4 in vivo and in vitro. The results \ndemonstrated that ACSL4 inhibition before reperfusion protected against \nferroptosis and cell death. Further investigation revealed that special protein \n1 (Sp1) was a crucial transcription factor that increased ACSL4 transcription by \nbinding to the ACSL4 promoter region. Collectively, this study demonstrates that \nferroptosis is closely associated with intestinal I/R injury, and that ACSL4 has \na critical role in this lethal process. Sp1 is an important factor in promoting \nACSL4 expression. These results suggest a unique and effective mechanistic \napproach for intestinal I/R injury prevention and treatment.",

            "TEXT": "Mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling drives formation of cytoplasmic \nchromatin and inflammation in senescence.\n\nCellular senescence is a potent tumor suppressor mechanism but also contributes \nto aging and aging-related diseases. Senescence is characterized by a stable \ncell cycle arrest and a complex proinflammatory secretome, termed the \nsenescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We recently discovered that \ncytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), extruded from the nucleus of senescent \ncells, trigger the SASP through activation of the innate immunity cytosolic DNA \nsensing cGAS-STING pathway. However, the upstream signaling events that \ninstigate CCF formation remain unknown. Here, we show that dysfunctional \nmitochondria, linked to down-regulation of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial \noxidative phosphorylation genes, trigger a ROS-JNK retrograde signaling pathway \nthat drives CCF formation and hence the SASP. JNK links to 53BP1, a nuclear \nprotein that negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection \nand CCF formation. Importantly, we show that low-dose HDAC inhibitors restore \nexpression of most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation \ngenes, improve mitochondrial function, and suppress CCFs and the SASP in \nsenescent cells. In mouse models, HDAC inhibitors also suppress oxidative \nstress, CCF, inflammation, and tissue damage caused by senescence-inducing \nirradiation and/or acetaminophen-induced mitochondria dysfunction. Overall, our \nfindings outline an extended mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling \npathway that initiates formation of CCF during senescence and is a potential \ntarget for drug-based interventions to inhibit the proaging SASP.",

Therefore, new approaches to target \napoptosis-resistant cancer cells are crucial for the development of directed \ncancer therapies. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cell cycle \nregulators on interferon (IFN)-induced necroptosis as an alternative cell death \nmechanism to overcome apoptosis resistance. Here, we report a novel combination \ntreatment of IFNs with cell cycle arrest-inducing compounds that induce \nnecroptosis in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells and elucidate the underlying \nmolecular mechanisms. Combination treatment of IFNs (i.e. IFNβ) with inhibitors \nof the cell cycle (e.g. vinorelbine (VNR), nocodazole (Noc), polo-like kinase-1 \n(Plk-1) inhibitor BI 6727) co-operate to induce necroptotic cell death upon \ncaspase inactivation. The mode of cell death was confirmed by pharmacological \ninhibition and siRNA-mediated downregulation of the key necroptotic factors \nreceptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase 3 (RIP3) and mixed-lineage kinase-like \n(MLKL) in various cell lines. Mechanistically, we show that necroptosis upon \nVNR/IFNβ/zVAD.fmk treatment is RIP1-independent but relies on IFNβ-induced gene \nexpression of Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as shown by quantitative RT-PCR and \ngenetic knockdown experiments. Interestingly, we find that RIP3 is \nphosphorylated in response to compounds that trigger mitotic arrest, even in the \nabsence of IFNβ signaling and necroptosis induction. Together, the \nidentification of a novel combination treatment that triggers necroptosis has \nimplications for the development of molecular-targeted therapies to circumvent \napoptosis resistance and point to an underestimated role of cell cycle \nregulation in cell death signaling.",

Inducing apoptosis of activated HSCs can attenuate or reverse \nfibrogenesis. In this study, we initially found that oroxylin A (OA) protected \nCCl4-induced liver injury accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) \nactivation of HSCs in mice. In vitro, OA treatment markedly reduced fibrogenesis \nby modulating extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation. OA inhibited cell \nproliferation and induced cell cycle arrest of HSCs at S phase. Further, OA was \nobserved to induce HSC apoptosis, as indicated by caspase activation. Using the \neIF2α dephosphorylation inhibitor salubrinal, we found that ERS pathway \nactivation was required for OA to induce HSC apoptosis. ERS-related proteins \nwere significantly upregulated by OA treatment, and salubrinal abrogated the \neffects of OA on HSCs. Thus, we inferred that OA attenuated HSC activation by \npromoting ERS. In vivo, inhibition of ERS by salubrinal partly abrogated the \nhepatoprotective effect of OA in CCl4-treated mice. In conclusion, our findings \nsuggest a role for ERS in the mechanism underlying amelioration of hepatic \nfibrosis by OA.",

In the flight \nmuscles of adult Chchd2 mutants, some mitochondria exhibited curling cristae and \na reduced number of cristae compared to those of controls. Overexpression of \nChchd2 carrying human disease-related point mutations failed to fully rescue the \nmitochondrial defects in Chchd2 mutants. In fat body cells, loss of Chchd2 \nresulted in fragmented mitochondria that could be partially rescued by Marf \noverexpression and enhanced by Opa1 RNAi. The expression level of Opa1 was \nreduced in Chchd2 mutants and increased when Chchd2 was overexpressed. The \nchaperone-like protein P32 co-immunoprecipitated with Chchd2 and YME1L, a \nprotease known to processes human OPA1. Moreover, the interaction between P32 \nand YME1L enhanced YME1L activity and promoted Opa1 degradation. Finally, Chchd2 \nstabilized Opa1 by competing with P32 for YME1L binding. We propose a model \nwhereby Chchd2 regulates mitochondrial morphology and tissue homeostasis by \nfine-tuning the levels of OPA1.",

However, the source of IFN-I signaling under \nhomeostatic conditions is unclear. We discovered that commensal microbes \nregulate the IFN-I response through induction of IFN-β by colonic DCs. Moreover, \nthe mechanism by which a specific commensal microbe induces IFN-β was \nidentified. Outer membrane (OM)-associated glycolipids of gut commensal microbes \nbelonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum induce expression of IFN-β. Using \nBacteroides fragilis and its OM-associated polysaccharide A, we determined that \nIFN-β expression was induced via TLR4-TRIF signaling. Antiviral activity of this \npurified microbial molecule against infection with either vesicular stomatitis \nvirus (VSV) or influenza was demonstrated to be dependent on the induction of \nIFN-β. In a murine VSV infection model, commensal-induced IFN-β regulated \nnatural resistance to virus infection. Due to the physiological importance of \nIFN-Is, discovery of an IFN-β-inducing microbial molecule represents a potential \napproach for the treatment of some human diseases.",

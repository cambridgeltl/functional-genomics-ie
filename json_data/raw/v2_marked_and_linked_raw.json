            "TEXT": "CASP9 (caspase 9) is essential for autophagosome maturation through regulation \nof mitochondrial homeostasis.\n\nCASP9 (caspase 9) is a well-known initiator caspase which triggers intrinsic \napoptosis. Recent studies also suggest various non-apoptotic roles of CASP9, \nincluding macroautophagy/autophagy regulation. However, the involvement of CASP9 \nin autophagy and its molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we \nreport the non-apoptotic function of CASP9 in positive regulation of autophagy \nthrough maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Growth factor or amino acid \ndeprivation-induced autophagy activated CASP9, but without apoptotic features. \nPharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of CASP9 decreased autophagy \nflux, while ectopic expression of CASP9 rescued autophagy defects. In CASP9 \nknockout (KO) cells, initiation and elongation of phagophore membranes were \nnormal, but sealing of the membranes and autophagosome maturation were impaired, \nand the lifetime of autophagosomes was prolonged. Ablation of CASP9 caused an \naccumulation of inactive ATG3 and decreased lipidation of the Atg8-family \nmembers, most severely that of GABARAPL1. Moreover, it resulted in abnormal \nmitochondrial morphology with depolarization of the membrane potential, reduced \nreactive oxygen species production, and aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial \nfusion-fission proteins. CASP9 expression or exogenously added H2O2 in the CASP9 \nKO cells corrected the ATG3 level and lipidation status of Atg8-family members, \nand restored autophagy flux. Of note, only CASP9 expression but not H2O2 rescued \nmitochondrial defects, revealing regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by \nCASP9. Our findings suggest a new regulatory link between mitochondria and \nautophagy through CASP9 activity, especially for the proper operation of the \nAtg8-family conjugation system and autophagosome closure and maturation.",

            "TEXT": "Tumor Fibroblast-Derived FGF2 Regulates Expression of SPRY1 in Esophageal \nTumor-Infiltrating T Cells and Plays a Role in T-cell Exhaustion.\n\nT-cell exhaustion was initially identified in chronic infection in mice and was \nsubsequently described in humans with cancer. Although the distinct signature of \nexhausted T (TEX) cells in cancer has been well investigated, the molecular \nmechanism of T-cell exhaustion in cancer is not fully understood. Using \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing, we report here that TEX cells in esophageal cancer \nare more heterogeneous than previously clarified. Sprouty RTK signaling \nantagonist 1 (SPRY1) was notably enriched in two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T \ncells. When overexpressed, SPRY1 impaired T-cell activation by interacting with \nCBL, a negative regulator of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation. Data from the \nTumor Immune Estimation Resource revealed a strong correlation between FGF2 and \nSPRY1 expression in esophageal cancer. High expression of FGF2 was evident in \nfibroblasts from esophageal cancer tissue and correlated with poor overall \nsurvival. In vitro administration of FGF2 significantly upregulated expression \nof SPRY1 in CD8+ T cells and attenuated T-cell receptor-triggered CD8+ T-cell \nactivation. A mouse tumor model confirmed that overexpression of FGF2 in \nfibroblasts significantly upregulated SPRY1 expression in TEX cells, impaired \nT-cell cytotoxic activity, and promoted tumor growth. Thus, these findings \nidentify FGF2 as an important regulator of SPRY1 expression involved in \nestablishing the dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells in esophageal cancer.",

            "TEXT": "METTL3 and ALKBH5 oppositely regulate m(6)A modification of TFEB mRNA, which \ndictates the fate of hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cardiomyocytes.\n\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modifications play critical roles in various \nbiological processes. However, no study addresses the role of m6A in \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that m6A modifications are increased in \nH/R-treated cardiomyocytes and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-treated mice heart. We \nfound that METTL3 (methyltransferase like 3) is the primary factor involved in \naberrant m6A modification. Silencing METTL3 enhances autophagic flux and \ninhibits apoptosis in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression of \nMETTL3 or inhibition of the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 has an opposite effect, \nsuggesting that METTL3 is a negative regulator of autophagy. Mechanistically, \nMETTL3 methylates TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy \ngenes, at two m6A residues in the 3'-UTR, which promotes the association of the \nRNA-binding protein HNRNPD with TFEB pre-mRNA and subsequently decreases the \nexpression levels of TFEB. Further experiments show that autophagic flux \nenhanced by METTL3 deficiency is TFEB dependent. In turn, TFEB regulates the \nexpression levels of METTL3 and ALKBH5 in opposite directions: it induces ALKBH5 \nand inhibits METTL3. TFEB binds to the ALKBH5 promoter and activates its \ntranscription. In contrast, inhibition of METTL3 by TFEB does not involve \ntranscriptional repression but rather downregulation of mRNA stability, thereby \nestablishing a negative feedback loop. Together, our work uncovers a critical \nlink between METTL3-ALKBH5 and autophagy, providing insight into the functional \nimportance of the reversible mRNA m6A methylation and its modulators in ischemic \nheart disease.",

            "TEXT": "Disrupting the TRIB3-SQSTM1 interaction reduces liver fibrosis by restoring \nautophagy and suppressing exosome-mediated HSC activation.\n\nImpaired macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic \nfibrosis. However, how aberrant autophagy promotes fibrosis is far from \nunderstood. Here, we aimed to define a previously unrevealed pro-fibrotic \nmechanism for the stress protein TRIB3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3)-mediated \nautophagy dysfunction. Human fibrotic liver tissues were obtained from patients \nwith cirrhosis who underwent an open surgical repair process. The functional \nimplications of TRIB3 were evaluated in mouse models of hepatic fibrosis induced \nby bile duct ligation (BDL) or thioacetamide (TAA) injection. Human fibrotic \nliver tissues expressed higher levels of TRIB3 and selective autophagic receptor \nSQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) than nonfibrotic tissues and the elevated expression \nof TRIB3 and SQSTM1 was positively correlated in the fibrotic tissues. Silencing \nTrib3 protected against experimentally induced hepatic fibrosis, accompanied by \nrestored autophagy activity in fibrotic liver tissues. Furthermore, TRIB3 \ninteracted with SQSTM1 and hindered its binding to MAP1LC3/LC3, which caused the \naccumulation of SQSTM1 aggregates and obstructed autophagic flux. The \nTRIB3-mediated autophagy impairment not only suppressed autophagic degradation \nof late endosomes but also promoted hepatocellular secretion of INHBA/Activin \nA-enriched exosomes which caused migration, proliferation and activation of \nhepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the effector cells of liver fibrosis. Disrupting \nthe TRIB3-SQSTM1 interaction with a specific helical peptide exerted potent \nprotective effects against hepatic fibrosis by restoring autophagic flux in \nhepatocytes and HSCs. Together, stress-elevated TRIB3 expression promotes \nhepatic fibrosis by interacting with SQSTM1 and interfering with its functions \nin liver-parenchymal cells and activating HSCs. Targeting this interaction is a \npromising strategy for treating fibroproliferative liver diseases.",

Here, we reported that TRAF6, an E3 \nubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling, inhibited \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CRC metastasis through driving a \nselective autophagic CTNNB1 degradation machinery. Mechanistically, TRAF6 \ninteracted with MAP1LC3B/LC3B through its LC3-interacting region 'YxxL' and \ncatalyzed K63-linked polyubiquitination of LC3B. The K63-linked ubiquitination \nof LC3B promoted the formation of the LC3B-ATG7 complex and was critical to the \nsubsequent recognition of CTNNB1 by LC3B for the selective autophagic \ndegradation. However, TRAF6 was phosphorylated at Thr266 by GSK3B in most \nclinical CRC, which triggered K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of \nTRAF6 and thereby attenuated its inhibitory activity towards the \nautophagy-dependent CTNNB1 signaling. Clinically, decreased expression of TRAF6 \nwas associated with elevated GSK3B protein levels and activity and reduced \noverall survival in CRC patients. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B activity \nstabilized the TRAF6 protein, promoted CTNNB1 degradation, and effectively \nsuppressed EMT and CRC metastasis. Thus, targeting TRAF6 and its pathway may be \nmeaningful for treating advanced CRC.",

The contextual \nagonistic and antagonistic Tie2 ligand ANGPT2 is believed to be exclusively \nproduced by endothelial cells, disrupting constitutive ANGPT1-TIE2 signaling to \ndestabilize the microvasculature during pathologic disorders like inflammation \nand cancer. However, scattered reports have also portrayed tumor cells as a \nsource of ANGPT2. Employing ISH-based detection of ANGPT2, we found strong tumor \ncell expression of ANGPT2 in a subset of patients with melanoma. Comparative \nanalysis of biopsies revealed a higher fraction of ANGPT2-expressing tumor cells \nin metastatic versus primary sites. Tumor cell-expressed Angpt2 was dispensable \nfor primary tumor growth, yet in-depth analysis of primary tumors revealed \nenhanced intratumoral necrosis upon silencing of tumor cell Angpt2 expression in \nthe absence of significant immune and vascular alterations. Global \ntranscriptional profiling of Angpt2-deficient tumor cells identified \nperturbations in redox homeostasis and an increased response to cellular \noxidative stress. Ultrastructural analyses illustrated a significant increase of \ndysfunctional mitochondria in Angpt2-silenced tumor cells, thereby resulting in \nenhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and downstream MAPK stress \nsignaling. Functionally, enhanced ROS in Angpt2-silenced tumor cells reduced \ncolonization potential in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these findings \nuncover the hitherto unappreciated role of tumor cell-expressed ANGPT2 as an \nautocrine-positive regulator of metastatic colonization and validate ANGPT2 as a \ntherapeutic target for a well-defined subset of patients with melanoma. \nSIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that tumor cells can be a source of ANGPT2 in \nthe tumor microenvironment and that tumor cell-derived ANGPT2 augments \nmetastatic colonization by protecting tumor cells from oxidative stress.",

We show here that human non-small cell \nlung cancer (NSCLC) cell line-derived, quiescent-like, slow-cycling cancer cells \n(SCC) and residual patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors after chemotherapy \nexperience activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-mediated upregulation of \nvarious cytokines, which acts in a paracrine manner to recruit fibroblasts. \nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) underwent transcriptional upregulation of \nCOX2 and type I collagen (Col-I), which subsequently triggered a slow-to-active \ncycling switch in SCC through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)- and integrin/Src-mediated \nsignaling pathways, leading to cancer progression. Both antagonism of ATF6 and \ncotargeting of Src/COX2 effectively suppressed cytokine production and \nslow-to-active cell cycling transition in SCC, withholding cancer progression. \nExpression of COX2 and Col-I and activation of Src were observed in patients \nwith NSCLC who progressed while receiving chemotherapy. Public data analysis \nrevealed significant association between COL1A1 and SRC expression and NSCLC \nrelapse. Overall, these findings indicate that a proinflammatory niche created \nby the interplay between SCC and CAF triggers tumor progression.

            "TEXT": "RNA-binding protein ZFP36/TTP protects against ferroptosis by regulating \nautophagy signaling pathway in hepatic stellate cells.\n\nFerroptosis is a recently discovered form of programmed cell death, but its \nregulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the \nRNA-binding protein ZFP36/TTP (ZFP36 ring finger protein) plays a crucial role \nin regulating ferroptosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Upon exposure to \nferroptosis-inducing compounds, the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7/CDC4 (F-box and WD \nrepeat domain containing 7) decreased ZFP36 protein expression by recognizing \nSFSGLPS motif. FBXW7 plasmid contributed to classical ferroptotic events, \nwhereas ZFP36 plasmid impaired FBXW7 plasmid-induced HSC ferroptosis. \nInterestingly, ZFP36 plasmid inhibited macroautophagy/autophagy activation by \ndestabilizing ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1) mRNA. ATG16L1 plasmid \neliminated the inhibitory action of ZFP36 plasmid on ferroptosis, and FBXW7 \nplasmid enhanced the effect of ATG16L1 plasmid on autophagy. Importantly, ZFP36 \nplasmid promoted ATG16L1 mRNA decay via binding to the AU-rich elements (AREs) \nwithin the 3'-untranslated region. The internal mutation of the ARE region \nabrogated the ZFP36-mediated ATG16L1 mRNA instability, and prevented ZFP36 \nplasmid-mediated ferroptosis resistance. In mice, treatment with erastin and \nsorafenib alleviated murine liver fibrosis by inducing HSC ferroptosis. \nHSC-specific overexpression of Zfp36 impaired erastin- or sorafenib-induced HSC \nferroptosis. Noteworthy, we analyzed the effect of sorafenib on HSC ferroptosis \nin fibrotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib \nmonotherapy. Attractively, sorafenib monotherapy led to ZFP36 downregulation, \nferritinophagy activation, and ferroptosis induction in human HSCs. Overall, \nthese results revealed novel molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of \nferroptosis, and also identified ZFP36-autophagy-dependent ferroptosis as a \npotential target for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

            "TEXT": "HDAC6 differentially regulates autophagy in stem-like versus differentiated \ncancer cells.\n\nCancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a small population of pluripotent cells residing \nwithin heterogeneous tumor mass, remain highly resistant to various \nchemotherapies as compared to the differentiated cancer cells. It is being \npostulated that CSCs possess unique molecular mechanisms, such as autophagic \nhomeostasis, that allow CSCs to withstand the therapeutic assaults. Here we \ndemonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition differentially modulates \nmacroautophagy/autophagy in CSCs as compared to that of differentiated cancer \ncells. Using human and murine CSC models and differentiated cells, we show that \nthe inhibition or knockdown (KD) of HDAC6 decreases CSC pluripotency by \ndownregulating major pluripotency factors POU5F1, NANOG and SOX2. This decreased \nHDAC6 expression increases ACTB, TUBB3 and CSN2 expression and promotes \ndifferentiation in CSCs in an apoptosis-independent manner. Mechanistically, \nHDAC6 KD in CSCs decreases pluripotency by promoting autophagy, whereas the \ninhibition of pluripotency via retinoic acid treatment, POU5F1 or \nautophagy-related gene (ATG7 and ATG12) KD in CSCs decreases HDAC6 expression \nand promotes differentiation. Interestingly, HDAC6 KD-mediated CSC growth \ninhibition is further enhanced in the presence of autophagy inducers Tat-Beclin \n1 peptide and rapamycin. In contrast to the results observed in CSCs, HDAC6 KD \nin differentiated breast cancer cells downregulates autophagy and increases \napoptosis. Furthermore, the autophagy regulator p-MTOR, upstream negative \nregulators of p-MTOR (TSC1 and TSC2) and downstream effectors of p-MTOR \n(p-RPS6KB and p-EIF4EBP1) are differentially regulated in CSCs versus \ndifferentiated cancer cells following HDAC6 KD. Overall these data identify the \ndifferential regulation of autophagy as a molecular link behind the differing \nchemo-susceptibility of CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.",

            "TEXT": "Stromal SNAI2 Is Required for ERBB2 Breast Cancer Progression.\n\nSNAI2 overexpression appears to be associated with poor prognosis in breast \ncancer, yet it remains unclear in which breast cancer subtypes this occurs. Here \nwe show that excess SNAI2 is associated with a poor prognosis of luminal B \nHER2+/ERBB2+ breast cancers in which SNAI2 expression in the stroma but not the \nepithelium correlates with tumor proliferation. To determine how stromal SNAI2 \nmight influence HER2+ tumor behavior, Snai2-deficient mice were crossed with a \nmouse line carrying the ErbB2/Neu protooncogene to generate HER2+/ERBB2+ breast \ncancer. Tumors generated in this model expressed SNAI2 in the stroma but not the \nepithelium, allowing for the role of stromal SNAI2 to be studied without \ninterference from the epithelial compartment. The absence of SNAI2 in the stroma \nof HER2+/ERBB2+ tumors is associated with: (i) lower levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) \nand reduced tumor epithelium proliferation; (ii) higher levels of AKT and a \nlower incidence of metastasis; (iii) lower levels of angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), \nand more necrosis. Together, these results indicate that the loss of SNAI2 in \ncancer-associated fibroblasts limits the production of some cytokines, which \ninfluences AKT/ERK tumor signaling and subsequent proliferative and metastatic \ncapacity of ERBB2+ breast cancer cells. Accordingly, SNAI2 expression in the \nstroma enhanced the tumorigenicity of luminal B HER2+/ERBB2+ breast cancers. \nThis work emphasizes the importance of stromal SNAI2 in breast cancer \nprogression and patients' prognosis.",

Multiple bioinformatic analyses of different human cancer \ndatabases identified key m6A-associated genetic mutations that regulated gastric \ntumorigenesis. YTHDF1 was mutated in about 7% of gastric cancer patients and \nhigh expression of YTHDF1 was associated with more aggressive tumor progression \nand poor overall survival. Inhibition of YTHDF1 attenuated GC cell proliferation \nand tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YTHDF1 promoted the \ntranslation of a key Wnt receptor frizzled7 (FZD7) in an m6A-dependent manner, \nand mutated YTHDF1 enhanced expression of FZD7, leading to hyper-activation of \nthe Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promotion of gastric carcinogenesis. Our results \ndemonstrate the oncogenic role of YTHDF1 and its m6A-mediated regulation of \nWnt/β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer, providing a novel approach of \ntargeting such epigenetic regulators in this disease.",

            "TEXT": "YAP and AP-1 Cooperate to Initiate Pancreatic Cancer Development from Ductal \nCells in Mice.\n\nThe development of pancreatic cancer is heavily dependent upon the aberrant \nactivation of KRAS signaling. Among the downstream targets of KRAS, the \neffectors of the Hippo pathway YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) are crucial during cancer \ninitiation and progression. However, little is known about the cell \ntype-specific effects of YAP/TAZ on the development of pancreatic cancer. Here \nwe clarify the unique consequences of YAP/TAZ activation in the ductal cell \npopulation of the pancreas by generating mice with pancreatic duct \ncell-specific, inducible knockouts of Lats1 and Lats2, the main kinases upstream \nof YAP/TAZ. Oncogenic activation of YAP by deletion of Lats1/2 in ductal cells \nled to the rapid transformation of the pancreas, which was accompanied by a \nrobust increase in the expression of YAP and AP-1 target genes. Pharmacologic \ninhibition of AP-1 activity induced death in Lats1/2 knockout organoids and \nattenuated YAP-dependent transformation of the pancreas in vivo. Both YAP and \nAP-1 were activated during the development of KRAS-dependent cancer in mice and \nhuman patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this \nsignaling hub represents an important mediator of pancreatic cancer development \nand progression. Collectively, these data define a YAP-dependent mechanism of \npancreatic cancer cell development and suggest that inhibition of AP-1 can \nsuppress this development.",

            "TEXT": "Hypoxia-induced autophagy drives colorectal cancer initiation and progression by \nactivating the PRKC/PKC-EZR (ezrin) pathway.\n\nIn solid tumors, cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are \noften found in hypoxic niches. Nevertheless, the influence of hypoxia on TICs is \npoorly understood. Using previously established, TIC-enrichedpatient-derived \ncolorectal cancer (CRC) cultures, we show that hypoxia increases the \nself-renewal capacity of TICs while inducing proliferation arrest in their more \ndifferentiated counterpart cultures. Gene expression data revealed \nmacroautophagy/autophagy as one of the major pathways induced by hypoxia in \nTICs. Interestingly, hypoxia-induced autophagy was found to induce \nphosphorylation of EZR (ezrin) at Thr567 residue, which could be reversed by \nknocking down ATG5, BNIP3, BNIP3L, or BECN1. Furthermore, we identified \nPRKCA/PKCα as a potential kinase involved in hypoxia-induced autophagy-mediated \nTIC self-renewal. Genetic targeting of autophagy or pharmacological inhibition \nof PRKC/PKC and EZR resulted in decreased tumor-initiating potential of TICs. In \naddition, we observed significantly reduced in vivo tumor initiation and growth \nafter a stable knockdown of ATG5. Analysis of human CRC samples showed that \np-EZR is often present in TICs located in the hypoxic and autophagic regions of \nthe tumor. Altogether, our results establish the hypoxia-autophagy-PKC-EZR \nsignaling axis as a novel regulatory mechanism of TIC self-renewal and CRC \nprogression. Autophagy inhibition might thus represent a promising therapeutic \nstrategy for cancer patients.",

            "TEXT": "Mutant IDH1 regulates the tumor-associated immune system in gliomas.\n\nGliomas harboring mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) have the \nCpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and significantly longer patient survival \ntime than wild-type IDH1/2 (wtIDH1/2) tumors. Although there are many factors \nunderlying the differences in survival between these two tumor types, \nimmune-related differences in cell content are potentially important \ncontributors. In order to investigate the role of IDH mutations in immune \nresponse, we created a syngeneic pair mouse model for mutant IDH1 (muIDH1) and \nwtIDH1 gliomas and demonstrated that muIDH1 mice showed many molecular and \nclinical similarities to muIDH1 human gliomas, including a 100-fold higher \nconcentration of 2-hydroxygluratate (2-HG), longer survival time, and higher CpG \nmethylation compared with wtIDH1. Also, we showed that IDH1 mutations caused \ndown-regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis, resulting in repression of the \ntumor-associated immune system. Given that significant infiltration of immune \ncells such as macrophages, microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils is linked to \npoor prognosis in many cancer types, these reduced immune infiltrates in muIDH1 \nglioma tumors may contribute in part to the differences in aggressiveness of the \ntwo glioma types.",

Despite the proven \ntumorigenic role of SLC3A2 in a number of cancers including head and neck \nsquamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), the link between SLC3A2, autophagy regulation \nand tumor radioresistance remained elusive. In a recently published study we \ndemonstrated that low levels of SLC3A2 and SLC7A5/LAT1 protein expression \nsignificantly correlate with good clinical prognosis in locally advanced HNSCC \ntreated with primary radiochemotherapy. The SLC3A2-deficient HNSCC cells show a \nhigher radiosensitivity and increased autophagy levels. We found that autophagy \nactivation is a tumor survival strategy to overcome nutrient stress by lack of \nSLC3A2 and to withstand radiation-mediated cell damage. Inhibition of the \nautophagy activation in SLC3A2 knockout HNSCC cells by knockdown of ATG5 \nexpression or treatment with bafilomycin A1 results in radiosensitivity. \nConsequently, the expression levels of ATG5 correlates with overall survival in \nHNSCC patients, and autophagy inhibition in combination with SLC3A2-targeted \ntherapy can be a promising strategy for HNSCC radiosensitization.",

The transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 (zinc \nand ring finger 3) and RNF43 (ring finger protein 43) antagonize Wnt signaling \nby promoting degradation of frizzled receptors. ZNRF3 and RNF43 are frequently \ninactivated in human cancer, but the molecular and therapeutic implications \nremain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adrenocortical-specific loss of ZNRF3, \nbut not RNF43, results in adrenal hyperplasia that depends on Porcupine-mediated \nWnt ligand secretion. Furthermore, we discovered a Wnt/β-catenin signaling \ngradient in the adrenal cortex that is disrupted upon loss of ZNRF3. Unlike \nβ-catenin gain-of-function models, which induce high Wnt/β-catenin activation \nand expansion of the peripheral cortex, ZNRF3 loss triggers activation of \nmoderate-level Wnt/β-catenin signaling that drives proliferative expansion of \nonly the histologically and functionally distinct inner cortex. Genetically \nreducing β-catenin dosage significantly reverses the ZNRF3-deficient phenotype. \nThus, homeostatic maintenance of the adrenal cortex is dependent on varying \nlevels of Wnt/β-catenin activation, which is regulated by ZNRF3.",

Administration of \nPHACTR2-AS1-30nt-RNA, which binds to SUV39H1, effectively inhibited breast \ncancer growth and lung metastasis in mice. PHACTR2-AS1 was downregulated in \nbreast cancer patients, where lower PHACTR2-AS1 expression promoted breast \ncancer development and correlated with poor patient outcome.

Since MTOR is known to \ngenerally suppress autophagy, the apparently independent regulation of these two \nkey pathways of glomerular maintenance remained puzzling. We now report that \nlong-term genetic manipulation of MTOR activity does in fact not influence high \nbasal levels of autophagy in podocytes either in vitro or in vivo. Instead we \npresent data showing that autophagy in podocytes is mainly controlled by \nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1 (unc-51 like kinase 1). \nPharmacological inhibition of MTOR further shows that the uncoupling of MTOR \nactivity and autophagy is time dependent. Together, our data reveal a novel and \nunexpected cell-specific mechanism, which permits concurrent MTOR activity as \nwell as high basal autophagy rates in podocytes. Thus, these data indicate \nmanipulation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis rather than inhibition of MTOR as a promising \ntherapeutic intervention to enhance autophagy and preserve podocyte homeostasis \nin glomerular diseases.",

A newly reported circular RNA \nHIPK3 (circHIPK3) is critical in cell proliferation of various cancer types, \nalthough its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has yet to be \nelucidated. Our results provided evidence that silencing of circHIPK3 \nsignificantly impaired cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induced \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Mechanistically, we uncovered that autophagy was \ninduced upon loss of circHIPK3 via the MIR124-3p-STAT3-PRKAA/AMPKa axis in STK11 \nmutant lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H838). STAT3 abrogation as well as \ntransfection with a MIR124-3p mimic, recapitulated the induction of autophagy. \nWe also demonstrated antagonistic regulation on autophagy between circHIPK3 and \nlinear HIPK3 (linHIPK3). We therefore propose that the ratio between circHIPK3 \nand linHIPK3 (C:L ratio) may reflect autophagy levels in cancer cells. We \nobserved that a high C:L ratio (>0.49) was an indicator of poor survival, \nespecially in advanced-stage NSCLC patients. These results support that \ncircHIPK3 is a key autophagy regulator in a subset of lung cancer and has \npotential clinical use as a prognostic factor. The circular RNA HIPK3 \n(circHIPK3) functions as an oncogene and autophagy regulator may potential use \nas a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in lung cancer.",

            "TEXT": "Autophagy drives fibroblast senescence through MTORC2 regulation.\n\nSustained macroautophagy/autophagy favors the differentiation of fibroblasts \ninto myofibroblasts. Cellular senescence, another means of responding to \nlong-term cellular stress, has also been linked to myofibroblast differentiation \nand fibrosis. Here, we evaluate the relationship between senescence and \nmyofibroblast differentiation in the context of sustained autophagy. We analyzed \nmarkers of cell cycle arrest/senescence in fibroblasts in vitro, where autophagy \nwas triggered by serum starvation (SS). Autophagic fibroblasts expressed the \nsenescence biomarkers CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 and exhibited increased \nsenescence-associated GLB1/beta-galactosidase activity. Inhibition of autophagy \nin serum-starved fibroblasts with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, or ATG7 (autophagy \nrelated 7) silencing prevented the expression of senescence-associated markers. \nSimilarly, suppressing MTORC2 activation using rapamycin or by silencing RICTOR \nalso prevented senescence hallmarks. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that \nsenescence and myofibroblast differentiation were induced in different cells, \nsuggesting mutually exclusive activation of senescence and myofibroblast \ndifferentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known inducers of senescence \nand exposing fibroblasts to ROS scavengers decreased ROS production during SS, \ninhibited autophagy, and significantly reduced the expression of senescence and \nmyofibroblast differentiation markers. ROS scavengers also curbed the AKT1 \nphosphorylation at Ser473, an MTORC2 target, establishing the importance of ROS \nin fueling MTORC2 activation. Inhibition of senescence by shRNA to TP53/p53 and \nshRNA CDKN2A/p16 increased myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a negative \nfeedback loop of senescence on autophagy-induced myofibroblast differentiation. \nCollectively, our results identify ROS as central inducers of MTORC2 activation \nduring chronic autophagy, which in turn fuels senescence activation and \nmyofibroblast differentiation in distinct cellular subpopulations.",

We hypothesized that a defective autophagy may \nfavor hypertension-related spontaneous stroke by promoting mitochondrial \ndysfunction. We studied autophagy in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive \n(SHRSP) rat, which represents a clinically relevant model of stroke associated \nwith high blood pressure. We assessed autophagy, mitophagy and NAD+:NADH levels \nin brains of SHRSP and stroke-resistant SHR fed with high salt diet. Vascular \nsmooth muscle cells silenced for the mitochondrial complex I subunit Ndufc2 gene \n(NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit C2) and cerebral endothelial cells \nisolated from SHRSP were also used to assess autophagy/mitophagy and \nmitochondrial function in response to high salt levels. We found a reduction of \nautophagy in brains of high salt-fed SHRSP. Autophagy impairment was associated \nwith NDUFC2 downregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and NAD+ depletion. \nRestoration of NAD+ levels by nicotinamide administration reactivated autophagy \nand reduced stroke development in SHRSP. A selective reactivation of \nautophagy/mitophagy by Tat-Beclin 1 also reduced stroke occurrence, restored \nautophagy/mitophagy and improved mitochondrial function. Endothelial progenitor \ncells (EPCs) from subjects homozygous for the thymine allele variant at \nNDUFC2/rs11237379, which is associated with NDUFC2 deficiency and increased \nstroke risk, displayed an impairment of autophagy and increased senescence in \nresponse to high salt levels. EPC senescence was rescued by Tat-Beclin 1. \nPharmacological activation of autophagy may represent a novel therapeutic \nstrategy to reduce stroke occurrence in hypertension.",

            "TEXT": "Epigenetic Inactivation of α-Internexin Accelerates Microtubule Polymerization \nin Colorectal Cancer.\n\nDNA methylation contributes to malignant transformation, but little is known \nabout how the methylation drives colorectal cancer evolution at the early \nstages. Here we identify aberrant INA (α-internexin) gene methylation in colon \nadenoma and adenocarcinoma by filtering data obtained from a genome-wide screen \nof methylated genes. The gene encoding INA, a type IV intermediate filament, was \nfrequently hypermethylated in CpG islands located in the promoter region. This \nhypermethylation preferentially occurred in large tumors and was a prognostic \nmarker for poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. This type \nof epigenetic alteration silenced INA expression in both adenoma and \nadenocarcinoma tissues. Gene silencing of INA in colorectal cancer cells \nincreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Restored INA expression \nblocked migration and invasion in vitro and reduced lung metastasis in vivo. \nMechanistically, INA directly inhibited microtubule polymerization in vitro and \ndecreased intracellular microtubule plus-end assembly rates. A peptide array \nscreen surveying the tubulin-binding sites in INA identified a tubulin-binding \nmotif located in the N-terminal head domain that plays a tumor-suppressive role \nby binding to unpolymerized tubulins and impeding microtubule polymerization. \nThus, epigenetic inactivation of INA is an intermediate filament reorganization \nevent that is essential to accelerate microtubule polymerization in the early \nstages of colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides insight into the \nepigenetic inactivation of INA, a novel identified tumor suppressor, which \nincreases microtubule polymerization during colorectal cancer progression.",

Here we show that opening of these \npromoters from their closed state in precursor cells requires function of the \nspermatocyte-specific tMAC complex, localized at the promoters. The \nspermatocyte-specific promoters lack the previously identified canonical core \npromoter elements except for the Inr. Instead, these promoters are enriched for \nthe binding site for the TALE-class homeodomain transcription factors Achi/Vis \nand for a motif originally identified under tMAC ChIP-seq peaks. The tMAC motif \nresembles part of the previously identified 14-bp β2UE1 element critical for \nspermatocyte-specific expression. Analysis of downstream sequences relative to \ntranscription start site usage suggested that ACA and CNAAATT motifs at specific \npositions can help promote efficient transcription initiation. Our results \nreveal how promoter-proximal sequence elements that recruit and are acted upon \nby cell type-specific chromatin binding complexes help establish a robust, cell \ntype-specific transcription program for terminal differentiation.",

In this study, SMARCB1, known initially as a bona fide \ntumor suppressor gene, was investigated in liver cancer. SMARCB1 was highly \nupregulated in liver cancer patients and was associated with poor prognosis. \nLoss- and gain-of-function studies in liver cells revealed that SMARCB1 loss led \nto reduced cell proliferation, wound healing capacity, and tumor growth in vivo. \nAnd although upregulated SMARCB1 appeared to contribute to SWItch/Sucrose \nNon-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex stability and integrity, it did not act using \nits known pathways antagonism with EZH2 or association between TP53 or AMPK. \nSMARCB1 knockdown induced a mild reduction in global H3K27 acetylation, and \nchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of SMARCB1 and acetylated histone H3K27 \nantibodies before and after SMARCB1 loss identified Nucleoporin210 (NUP210) as a \ncritical target of SMARCB1, which bound its enhancer and changed H3K27Ac \nenrichment and downstream gene expression, particularly cholesterol homeostasis \nand xenobiotic metabolism. Notably, NUP210 was not only a putative tumor \nsupporter involved in liver cancer but also acted as a key scaffold for SMARCB1 \nand P300 to chromatin. Furthermore, SMARCB1 deficiency conferred sensitivity to \ndoxorubicin and P300 inhibitor in liver cancer cells. These findings provide \ninsights into mechanisms underlying dysregulation of chromatin remodelers and \nshow novel associations between nucleoporins and chromatin remodelers in cancer.",

            "TEXT": "Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Is Not Essential for K-Ras-Driven Tumor Growth \nor Metastasis.\n\nThe enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a major contributor to \nNADPH production and redox homeostasis and its expression is upregulated and \ncorrelated with negative patient outcomes in multiple human cancer types. \nDespite these associations, whether G6PD is essential for tumor initiation, \ngrowth, or metastasis remains unclear. Here, we employ modern genetic tools to \nevaluate the role of G6PD in lung, breast, and colon cancer driven by oncogenic \nK-Ras. Human HCT116 colorectal cancer cells lacking G6PD exhibited metabolic \nindicators of oxidative stress, but developed into subcutaneous xenografts with \ngrowth comparable with that of wild-type controls. In a genetically engineered \nmouse model of non-small cell lung cancer driven by K-Ras G12D and p53 \ndeficiency, G6PD knockout did not block formation or proliferation of primary \nlung tumors. In MDA-MB-231-derived human triple-negative breast cancer cells \nimplanted as orthotopic xenografts, loss of G6PD modestly decreased primary site \ngrowth without ablating spontaneous metastasis to the lung and moderately \nimpaired the ability of breast cancer cells to colonize the lung when delivered \nvia tail vein injection. Thus, in the studied K-Ras tumor models, G6PD was not \nstrictly essential for tumorigenesis and at most modestly promoted disease \nprogression. SIGNIFICANCE: K-Ras-driven tumors can grow and metastasize even in \nthe absence of the oxidative pentose pathway, a main NADPH production route.",

            "TEXT": "NOX4 Inhibition Potentiates Immunotherapy by Overcoming Cancer-Associated \nFibroblast-Mediated CD8 T-cell Exclusion from Tumors.\n\nDetermining mechanisms of resistance to αPD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint \nimmunotherapy is key to developing new treatment strategies. Cancer-associated \nfibroblasts (CAF) have many tumor-promoting functions and promote immune evasion \nthrough multiple mechanisms, but as yet, no CAF-specific inhibitors are \nclinically available. Here we generated CAF-rich murine tumor models (TC1, MC38, \nand 4T1) to investigate how CAFs influence the immune microenvironment and \naffect response to different immunotherapy modalities [anticancer vaccination, \nTC1 (HPV E7 DNA vaccine), αPD-1, and MC38] and found that CAFs broadly \nsuppressed response by specifically excluding CD8+ T cells from tumors (not CD4+ \nT cells or macrophages); CD8+ T-cell exclusion was similarly present in CAF-rich \nhuman tumors. RNA sequencing of CD8+ T cells from CAF-rich murine tumors and \nimmunochemistry analysis of human tumors identified significant upregulation of \nCTLA-4 in the absence of other exhaustion markers; inhibiting CTLA-4 with a \nnondepleting antibody overcame the CD8+ T-cell exclusion effect without \naffecting Tregs. We then examined the potential for CAF targeting, focusing on \nthe ROS-producing enzyme NOX4, which is upregulated by CAF in many human \ncancers, and compared this with TGFβ1 inhibition, a key regulator of the CAF \nphenotype. siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition [GKT137831 (Setanaxib)] \nof NOX4 \"normalized\" CAF to a quiescent phenotype and promoted intratumoral CD8+ \nT-cell infiltration, overcoming the exclusion effect; TGFβ1 inhibition could \nprevent, but not reverse, CAF differentiation. Finally, NOX4 inhibition restored \nimmunotherapy response in CAF-rich tumors. These findings demonstrate that \nCAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance can be effectively overcome through NOX4 \ninhibition and could improve outcome in a broad range of cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: \nNOX4 is critical for maintaining the immune-suppressive CAF phenotype in tumors. \nPharmacologic inhibition of NOX4 potentiates immunotherapy by overcoming \nCAF-mediated CD8+ T-cell exclusion.",

Loss of Afadin also impairs the ability of breast cancer \ncells to form colonies in soft agar and metastasize to the lungs or liver. \nImmunohistochemical analysis of Claudin-2 and/or Afadin expression in 206 \nmetastatic breast cancer tumors revealed that high levels of both Claudin-2 and \nAfadin in primary tumors were associated with poor disease-specific survival, \nrelapse-free survival, lung-specific relapse, and liver-specific relapse. Our \nfindings indicate that signaling downstream from a Claudin-2/Afadin complex \nenables the efficient formation of breast cancer metastases. Moreover, combining \nClaudin-2 and Afadin as prognostic markers better predicts the potential of \nbreast cancer to metastasize to soft tissues.",

The altered balance between pro- and \nantiapoptosis signals within cancer cells is critical to therapeutic resistance. \nHowever, the molecular mechanisms underlying increased antiapoptosis signals \nremain poorly understood. In this study, we report that PRMT1 expression is \nincreased in pancreatic cancer tissues and is associated with higher tumor \ngrade, increased aggressiveness, and worse prognosis. PRMT1 overexpression \nincreased arginine methylation of HSPs of 70 kDa (HSP70); this methylation \nenhanced HSP70 binding and stabilization of BCL2 mRNA through AU-rich elements \nin 3'-untranslated region and consequentially increased BCL2 protein expression \nand protected cancer cells from apoptosis induced by cellular stresses and \ntherapeutics. RNA binding and regulation function of HSP70 was involved in \npancreatic cancer drug resistance and was dependent on protein arginine \nmethylation. These findings not only reveal a novel PRMT1-HSP70-BCL2 signaling \naxis that is crucial to pancreatic cancer cell survival and therapeutic \nresistance, but they also provide a proof of concept that targeted inhibition of \nthis axis may represent a new therapeutic strategy.",

Recent studies have revealed that \nRNA-binding proteins (RBP) are involved in tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate \nthat PSF/SFPQ is an RBP that potentially predicts poor prognosis of patients \nwith ER-positive breast cancer by posttranscriptionally regulating ERα (ESR1) \nmRNA expression. Strong PSF immunoreactivity correlated with shorter overall \nsurvival in patients with ER-positive breast cancer. PSF was predominantly \nexpressed in a model of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, and depletion \nof PSF attenuated proliferation of cultured cells and xenografted tumors. PSF \nexpression was significantly associated with estrogen signaling. PSF siRNA \ndownregulated ESR1 mRNA by inhibiting nuclear export of the RNA. Integrative \nanalyses of microarray and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing also identified \nSCFD2, TRA2B, and ASPM as targets of PSF. Among the PSF targets, SCFD2 was a \npoor prognostic indicator of breast cancer and SCFD2 knockdown significantly \nsuppressed breast cancer cell proliferation.

            "TEXT": "USP10 Promotes Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Deubiquitinating and \nStabilizing YAP/TAZ.\n\nYes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with \nPDZ-binding motif (TAZ), play pivotal roles in promoting the progression of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism underpinning \naberrant activation of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In \nthis study, we globally profiled the contribution of deubiquitinating enzymes \n(DUB) to both transcriptional activity and protein abundance of YAP/TAZ in \nhepatocellular carcinoma models and identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 \n(USP10) as a potent YAP/TAZ-activating DUB. Mechanistically, USP10 directly \ninteracted with and stabilized YAP/TAZ by reverting their proteolytic \nubiquitination. Depletion of USP10 enhanced polyubiquitination of YAP/TAZ, \npromoted their proteasomal degradation, and ultimately arrested the \nproliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Expression \nlevels of USP10 positively correlated with the abundance of YAP/TAZ in \nhepatocellular carcinoma patient samples as well as in N-nitrosodiethylamine \n(DEN)-induced liver cancer mice models. Collectively, this study establishes the \ncausal link between USP10 and hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma \ncells and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the \ntreatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma harboring a high level of \nYAP/TAZ. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify USP10 as a DUB of YAP/TAZ and its \nrole in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, which may serve as a potential \ntherapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.",

One of the affected factors, U2AF1, is involved in \nsplice site selection, and the most common change, S34F, alters a conserved \nnucleic acid-binding domain, recognition of the 3' splice site, and alternative \nsplicing of many mRNAs. However, the role that this mutation plays in \noncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we uncovered a noncanonical function of \nU2AF1, showing that it directly binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and \nnegatively regulates mRNA translation. This splicing-independent role of U2AF1 \nis altered by the S34F mutation, and polysome profiling indicates that the \nmutation affects translation of hundreds of mRNA. One functional consequence is \nincreased synthesis of the secreted chemokine interleukin 8, which contributes \nto metastasis, inflammation, and cancer progression in mice and humans.",

            "TEXT": "The P2RY12 receptor promotes VSMC-derived foam cell formation by inhibiting \nautophagy in advanced atherosclerosis.\n\nVascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are an important source of foam cells in \natherosclerosis. The mechanism for VSMC-derived foam cell formation is, however, \npoorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the P2RY12/P2Y12 receptor is \nimportant in regulating macroautophagy/autophagy and VSMC-derived foam cell \nformation in advanced atherosclerosis. Inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor \nameliorated lipid accumulation and VSMC-derived foam cell formation in high-fat \ndiet-fed apoe-/- mice (atherosclerosis model) independent of LDL-c levels. \nActivation of the P2RY12 receptor blocked cholesterol efflux via PI3K-AKT, while \ngenetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor inhibited \nthis effect in VSMCs. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed that the P2RY12 receptor \nregulated the autophagy pathway in VSMCs. Additionally, activation of the P2RY12 \nreceptor inhibited MAP1LC3/LC3 maturation, SQSTM1 degradation, and autophagosome \nformation in VSMCs. Genetic knockdown of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 \nsignificantly attenuated P2RY12 receptor inhibitor-induced cholesterol efflux in \nVSMCs. Furthermore, activation of the P2RY12 receptor led to the activation of \nMTOR through PI3K-AKT in VSMCs, whereas blocking MTOR activity (rapamycin) or \nreducing MTOR expression reversed the inhibition of cholesterol efflux mediated \nby the P2RY12 receptor in VSMCs. In vivo, inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor \npromoted autophagy of VSMCs through PI3K-AKT-MTOR in advanced atherosclerosis in \napoe-/- mice, which could be impeded by an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine). \nTherefore, we conclude that activation of the P2RY12 receptor decreases \ncholesterol efflux and promotes VSMC-derived foam cell formation by blocking \nautophagy in advanced atherosclerosis. Our study thus suggests that the P2RY12 \nreceptor is a therapeutic target for treating atherosclerosis.",

            "TEXT": "IRE1α Disruption in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cooperates with Antiangiogenic \nTherapy by Reversing ER Stress Adaptation and Remodeling the Tumor \nMicroenvironment.\n\nCancer cells exploit the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) stress caused by cellular oncogene activation and a hostile tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME). The key UPR sensor IRE1α resides in the ER and deploys a \ncytoplasmic kinase-endoribonuclease module to activate the transcription factor \nXBP1s, which facilitates ER-mediated protein folding. Studies of triple-negative \nbreast cancer (TNBC)-a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal posttreatment \nprognosis-implicate XBP1s in promoting tumor vascularization and progression. \nHowever, it remains unknown whether IRE1α adapts the ER in TNBC cells and \nmodulates their TME, and whether IRE1α inhibition can enhance antiangiogenic \ntherapy-previously found to be ineffective in patients with TNBC. To gauge IRE1α \nfunction, we defined an XBP1s-dependent gene signature, which revealed \nsignificant IRE1α pathway activation in multiple solid cancers, including TNBC. \nIRE1α knockout in TNBC cells markedly reversed substantial ultrastructural \nexpansion of their ER upon growth in vivo. IRE1α disruption also led to \nsignificant remodeling of the cellular TME, increasing pericyte numbers while \ndecreasing cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. \nPharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition strongly attenuated growth of cell \nline-based and patient-derived TNBC xenografts in mice and synergized with \nanti-VEGFA treatment to cause tumor stasis or regression. Thus, TNBC cells \ncritically rely on IRE1α to adapt their ER to in vivo stress and to adjust the \nTME to facilitate malignant growth. TNBC reliance on IRE1α is an important \nvulnerability that can be uniquely exploited in combination with antiangiogenic \ntherapy as a promising new biologic approach to combat this lethal disease. \nSIGNIFICANCE: Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition reverses ultrastructural \ndistension of the ER, normalizes the tumor vasculature, and remodels the \ncellular TME, attenuating TNBC growth in mice.",

Comparison of LC-MS/MS \nlysosomal membrane lipid profiles from TBI and sham animals suggested a role for \nPLA2G4A/cPLA2 (phospholipase A2, group IVA [cytosolic, calcium-dependent]) in \nTBI-induced LMP. Activation of PLA2G4A caused LMP and inhibition of autophagy \nflux in cell lines and primary neurons. In vivo pharmacological inhibition of \nPLA2G4A attenuated TBI-induced LMP, as well as subsequent impairment of \nautophagy and neuronal loss, and was associated with improved neurological \noutcomes. Inhibition of PLA2G4A in vitro limited amyloid-β-induced LMP and \ninhibition of autophagy.

By identifying a novel p53 acetylation \nsite at lysine K136, we found that simultaneous mutations at all five \nacetylation sites (p53-5KR) diminished its remaining tumor suppression function. \nMoreover, the embryonic lethality caused by the deficiency of mdm2 was fully \nrescued in the background of p535KR/5KR , but not p534KR/4KR background. p53-4KR \nretained the ability to suppress mTOR function but this activity was abolished \nin p53-5KR cells. Notably, the early-onset tumor formation observed in \np535KR/5KR and p53-null mice was suppressed upon the treatment of the mTOR \ninhibitor. These results suggest that p53-mediated mTOR regulation plays an \nimportant role in both embryonic development and tumor suppression, independent \nof cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, and ferroptosis.",

            "TEXT": "KIF15-Mediated Stabilization of AR and AR-V7 Contributes to Enzalutamide \nResistance in Prostate Cancer.\n\nThe new generation androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitor enzalutamide can \nprolong the survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. However, \nresistance to enzalutamide inevitably develops in these patients, and the \nunderlying mechanisms of this resistance are not fully defined. Here we \ndemonstrate that the kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) contributes to \nenzalutamide resistance by enhancing the AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. \nKIF15 directly bound the N-terminus of AR/AR-V7 and prevented AR/AR-V7 proteins \nfrom degradation by increasing the protein association of ubiquitin-specific \nprotease 14 (USP14) with AR/AR-V7. In turn, the transcriptionally active AR \nstimulated KIF15 expression. KIF15 inhibitors alone or in combination with \nenzalutamide significantly suppressed enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer \ncell growth and xenograft progression. These findings highlight a key role of \nKIF15 in enabling prostate cancer cells to develop therapy resistance to \nenzalutamide and rationalize KIF15 as a potential therapeutic target. \nSIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate how reciprocal activation between KIF15 \nand AR contributes to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer and highlights \ncotargeting KIF15 and AR as a therapeutic strategy for these tumors.",

The mitochondrial regulator PPARGC1A (peroxisome \nproliferator activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha) regulates \nmitochondrial biogenesis, reducing senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells \n(VSMCs); however, it is unknown whether autophagy mediates PPARGC1A-protective \neffects on senescence. Using ppargc1a-/- VSMCs, we identified the autophagy \nreceptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) as a major regulator of autophagy and \nsenescence of VSMCs. Abnormal autophagosomes were observed in VSMCs in aortas of \nppargc1a-/- mice. ppargc1a-/- VSMCs in culture presented reductions in LC3-II \nlevels; in autophagosome number; and in the expression of SQSTM1 (protein and \nmRNA), LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2), CTSD (cathepsin D), and \nTFRC (transferrin receptor). Reduced SQSTM1 protein expression was also observed \nin aortas of ppargc1a-/- mice and was upregulated by PPARGC1A overexpression, \nsuggesting that SQSTM1 is a direct target of PPARGC1A. Inhibition of autophagy \nby 3-MA (3 methyladenine), spautin-1 or Atg5 (autophagy related 5) siRNA \nstimulated senescence. Rapamycin rescued the effect of Atg5 siRNA in Ppargc1a+/+ \n, but not in ppargc1a-/- VSMCs, suggesting that other targets of MTOR \n(mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase), in addition to autophagy, also \ncontribute to senescence. Sqstm1 siRNA increased senescence basally and in \nresponse to AGT II (angiotensin II) and zinc overload, two known inducers of \nsenescence. Furthermore, Sqstm1 gene deficiency mimicked the phenotype of \nPpargc1a depletion by presenting reduced autophagy and increased senescence in \nvitro and in vivo. Thus, PPARGC1A upregulates autophagy reducing senescence by a \nSQSTM1-dependent mechanism. We propose SQSTM1 as a novel target in therapeutic \ninterventions reducing senescence.",

            "TEXT": "EZH2-Mediated Downregulation of the Tumor Suppressor DAB2IP Maintains Ovarian \nCancer Stem Cells.\n\nThe majority of women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer eventually \ndevelop recurrence, which rapidly evolves into chemoresistant disease. \nPersistence of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) at the end of therapy may be \nresponsible for emergence of resistant tumors. In this study, we demonstrate \nthat in OCSC, the tumor suppressor disabled homolog 2-interacting protein \n(DAB2IP) is silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation of the DAB2IP \npromoter. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of DAB2IP in epithelial ovarian cancer \ncell lines upregulated expression of stemness-related genes and induced \nconversion of non-CSC to CSC, while enforced expression of DAB2IP suppressed CSC \nproperties. Transcriptomic analysis showed that overexpression of DAB2IP in \novarian cancer significantly altered stemness-associated genes and bioinformatic \nanalysis revealed WNT signaling as a dominant pathway mediating the CSC \ninhibitory effect of DAB2IP. Specifically, DAB2IP inhibited WNT signaling via \ndownregulation of WNT5B, an important stemness inducer. Reverse phase protein \narray further demonstrated activation of noncanonical WNT signaling via C-JUN as \na downstream target of WNT5B, which was blocked by inhibiting RAC1, a prominent \nregulator of C-JUN activation. Coadministration of EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and \nRAC1 inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed OCSC survival in vitro and inhibited tumor \ngrowth and increased platinum sensitivity in vivo. Overall, these data establish \nthat DAB2IP suppresses the cancer stem cell phenotype via inhibition of \nWNT5B-induced activation of C-JUN and can be epigenetically silenced by EZH2 in \nOCSC. Targeting the EZH2/DAB2IP/C-JUN axis therefore presents a promising \nstrategy to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence and has potential for clinical \ntranslation.",

            "TEXT": "RAD51AP1 Deficiency Reduces Tumor Growth by Targeting Stem Cell Self-Renewal.\n\nRAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) plays an integral role in homologous \nrecombination by activating RAD51 recombinase. Homologous recombination is \nessential for preserving genome integrity and RAD51AP1 is critical for D-loop \nformation, a key step in homologous recombination. Although RAD51AP1 is involved \nin maintaining genomic stability, recent studies have shown that RAD51AP1 \nexpression is significantly upregulated in human cancers. However, the \nfunctional role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and the underlying molecular \nmechanism(s) by which RAD51AP1 regulates tumorigenesis have not been fully \nunderstood. Here, we use Rad51ap1-knockout mice in genetically engineered mouse \nmodels of breast cancer to unravel the role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and \nmetastasis. RAD51AP1 gene transcript was increased in both luminal estrogen \nreceptor-positive breast cancer and basal triple-negative breast cancer, which \nis associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, knockdown of RAD51AP1 (RADP51AP1 \nKD) in breast cancer cell lines reduced tumor growth. Rad51ap1-deficient mice \nwere protected from oncogene-driven spontaneous mouse mammary tumor growth and \nassociated lung metastasis. In vivo, limiting dilution studies provided evidence \nthat Rad51ap1 plays a critical role in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) \nself-renewal. RAD51AP1 KD improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy response by \ninhibiting BCSC self-renewal and associated pluripotency. Overall, our study \nprovides genetic and biochemical evidences that RAD51AP1 is critical for tumor \ngrowth and metastasis by increasing BCSC self-renewal and may serve as a novel \ntarget for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-resistant breast cancer.",

            "TEXT": "MTORC1 coordinates the autophagy and apoptosis signaling in articular \nchondrocytes in osteoarthritic temporomandibular joint.\n\nA switch from autophagy to apoptosis is implicated in chondrocytes during the \nosteoarthritis (OA) progression with currently unknown mechanism(s). In this \nstudy we utilized a flow fluid shear stress (FFSS) model in cultured \nchondrocytes and a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) animal model. We found \nthat both FFSS and UAC actively induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in \nthe temporomandibular joints (TMJ) chondrocytes, as demonstrated by dramatic \nincreases in expression of HSPA5, p-EIF2AK3, p-ERN1 and ATF6. Interestingly, \nboth FFSS and UAC activated not only pro-death p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS-apoptosis \nprograms but also pro-survival p-ERN1-mediated autophagic flux in chondrocytes. \nData from FFSS demonstrated that MTORC1, a downstream of p-ERN1, suppressed \nautophagy but promoted p-EIF2AK3 mediated ERS-apoptosis. Data from UAC model \ndemonstrated that at early stage both the p-ERN1 and p-EIF2AK3 were activated \nand MTORC1 was inhibited in TMJ chondrocytes. At late stage, \nMTORC1-p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS apoptosis were predominant, while p-ERN1 and \nautophagic flux were inhibited. Inhibition of MTORC1 by TMJ local injection of \nrapamycin in rats or inducible ablation of MTORC1 expression selectively in \nchondrocytes in mice promoted chondrocyte autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, \nand reduced TMJ cartilage loss induced by UAC. In contrast, MTORC1 activation by \nTMJ local administration of MHY1485 or genetic deletion of Tsc1, an upstream \nMTORC1 suppressor, resulted in opposite effects. Collectively, our results \nestablish that aberrant mechanical loading causes cartilage degeneration by \nactivating, at least in part, the MTORC1 signaling which modulates the autophagy \nand apoptosis programs in TMJ chondrocytes. Thus, inhibition of MTORC1 provides \na novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of OA.",

PAQR3 is a newly \ndiscovered tumor suppressor that also regulates autophagy induced by nutrient \nstarvation via AMPK and MTORC1 signaling pathways. In this study, we \ninvestigated whether PAQR3 modulates EGFR-mediated autophagy and whether such \nregulation is associated with the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3. PAQR3 is \nable to inhibit the in vitro and in vivo growth of non-small cell lung cancer \n(NSCLC) cells. PAQR3 potentiates autophagy induced by EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. \nKnockdown of PAQR3 abrogates erlotinib-mediated reduction of BECN1 interaction \nwith autophagy inhibitory proteins RUBCN/Rubicon and BCL2. PAQR3 blocks the \ninteraction of BECN1 with the activated form of EGFR and inhibits tyrosine \nphosphorylation of BECN1. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by knocking down \nATG7 abrogates the tumor suppressive activity of PAQR3 in NSCLC cells. \nCollectively, these data indicate that PAQR3 suppresses tumor progression of \nNSCLC cells through modulating EGFR-regulated autophagy.",

However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications \nand inactivating mutations in TRPS1 have been reported. Here, we used in vitro \nand in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary \ngland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by \nfunctional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary \nepithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling \npromotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 \nexpression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo \nsurvival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, \nthe consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined \ninactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary \norganoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results \ndemonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in \nbreast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal \nmammary epithelial cells.",

            "TEXT": "Ubiquitination of UVRAG by SMURF1 promotes autophagosome maturation and inhibits \nhepatocellular carcinoma growth.\n\nUVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated) is an important regulator of \nmammalian macroautophagy/autophagy by interacting with BECN1, PIK3C3, and RUBCN. \nPhosphorylation of UVRAG by MTORC1 negatively regulates autophagosome maturation \nunder nutrient-enriched conditions. However, how UVRAG ubiquitination is \nregulated is still unknown. Here we report that UVRAG is ubiquitinated by SMURF1 \nat lysine residues 517 and 559, which decreases the association of UVRAG with \nRUBCN and promotes autophagosome maturation. However, the deubiquitinase ZRANB1 \nspecifically cleaves SMURF1-induced K29 and K33-linked polyubiquitin chains from \nUVRAG, thereby increasing the binding of UVRAG to RUBCN and inhibiting autophagy \nflux. We also demonstrate that CSNK1A1-mediated UVRAG phosphorylation at Ser522 \ndisrupts the binding of SMURF1 to UVRAG through PPxY motif and blocks UVRAG \nubiquitination-mediated autophagosome maturation. Interestingly, ZRANB1 is \nphosphorylated at Thr35, and Ser209 residues by CSNK1A1, and this \nphosphorylation activates its deubiquitinating activity. Importantly, we provide \nin vitro and in vivo evidence that UVRAG ubiquitination at lysine residues 517 \nand 559 or prevention of Ser522 phosphorylation by D4476, a CSNK1A1 inhibitor, \nenhances the lysosomal degradation of EGFR, which significantly inhibits \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth. Furthermore, UVRAG S522 phosphorylation \nlevels correlate with ZRANB1 T35/S209 phosphorylation levels and poor prognosis \nin HCC patients. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism by which \nubiquitination and phosphorylation of UVRAG regulate its function in \nautophagosome maturation and HCC growth, encouraging further study of their \npotential therapeutic implications.",

In agreement, RAD52 \nwas dispensable for DSB-induced telomere synthesis. Moreover, a targeted CRISPR \nscreen revealed that loss of the structure-specific endonuclease scaffold SLX4 \nreduced the proliferation of RAD52-null ALT cells. While SLX4 was dispensable \nfor RAD52-mediated ALT telomere synthesis in G2, combined SLX4 and RAD52 loss \nresulted in elevated telomere loss, unresolved telomere recombination \nintermediates, and mitotic infidelity. These findings establish that RAD52 and \nSLX4 mediate distinct postreplicative DNA repair processes that maintain ALT \ntelomere stability and cancer cell viability.",

Here we elucidate a MYC-miRNA-MXI1 feedback loop that \nregulates proliferation and tumorigenesis in glioma. MYC suppressed MXI1 \nexpression via microRNA-155 (miR-155) and the microRNA-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster \n(miR-23a cluster), whereas MXI1, in turn, inhibited MYC expression by binding to \nits promoter.

Furthermore, fat mass and obesity-associated \nprotein (FTO), an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA demethylase, regulated the loop \nby targeting MYC. The ethyl ester form of meclofenamic acid (MA2) inhibited FTO \nand enhanced the effect of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide on suppressing \nproliferation of glioma cells and negatively regulated the loop.

To investigate the \nspecific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in \nmonocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine \n(3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and \nadenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells \nand multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, \nGGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these \nprocesses. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly \ndecreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic \ndifferentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level \nof Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic \ndifferentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of \nBeclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the \nlevel of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid \ncell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules \n(CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27kip1). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of \nBecn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone \nactivation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and \noverexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In \naddition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 \nacetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the \nfirst time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy \nprocess during osteoclastogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "Neat1 is a p53-inducible lincRNA essential for transformation suppression.\n\nThe p53 gene is mutated in over half of all cancers, reflecting its critical \nrole as a tumor suppressor. Although p53 is a transcriptional activator that \ninduces myriad target genes, those p53-inducible genes most critical for tumor \nsuppression remain elusive. Here, we leveraged p53 ChIP-seq (chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq \n(RNA sequencing) data sets to identify new p53 target genes, focusing on the \nnoncoding genome. We identify Neat1, a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) constituent of \nparaspeckles, as a p53 target gene broadly induced by mouse and human p53 in \ndifferent cell types and by diverse stress signals. Using fibroblasts derived \nfrom Neat1-/- mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53 pathway. \nWe found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in \nresponse to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in \nsuppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency \nenhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the \ndevelopment of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and \ncystic lesions in KrasG12D-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes \nin gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes \nneoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large \nintergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and \ncancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor \nsuppression.",

            "TEXT": "Neuropathy-causing mutations in HSPB1 impair autophagy by disturbing the \nformation of SQSTM1/p62 bodies.\n\nHSPB1 (heat shock protein family B [small] member 1) is a ubiquitously expressed \nmolecular chaperone. Most mutations in HSPB1 cause axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth \nneuropathy and/or distal hereditary motor neuropathy. In this study we show that \nmutations in HSPB1 lead to impairment of macroautophagic/autophagic flux. In \nHSPB1 knockout cells, we demonstrate that HSPB1 is necessary for autophagosome \nformation, which was rescued upon re-expression of HSPB1. Employing a label-free \nLC-MS/MS analysis on the various HSPB1 variants (wild type and mutants), we \nidentified autophagy-specific interactors. We reveal that the wild-type HSPB1 \nprotein binds to the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 and that the PB1 domain of \nSQSTM1 is essential for this interaction. Mutations in HSPB1 lead to a decrease \nin the formation of SQSTM1/p62 bodies, and subsequent impairment of phagophore \nformation, suggesting a regulatory role for HSPB1 in autophagy via interaction \nwith SQSTM1. Remarkably, autophagy deficits could also be confirmed in \npatient-derived motor neurons thereby indicating that the impairment of \nautophagy might be one of the pathomechanisms by which mutations in HSPB1 lead \nto peripheral neuropathy.",

            "TEXT": "MAPT/Tau accumulation represses autophagy flux by disrupting IST1-regulated \nESCRT-III complex formation: a vicious cycle in Alzheimer neurodegeneration.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy deficit induces intracellular MAPT/tau accumulation, \nthe hallmark pathology in Alzheimer disease (AD) and other tauopathies; however, \nthe reverse role of MAPT accumulation in autophagy and neurodegeneration is not \nclear. Here, we found that overexpression of human wild-type full-length MAPT, \nwhich models MAPT pathologies as seen in sporadic AD patients, induced autophagy \ndeficits via repression of autophagosome-lysosome fusion leading to \nsignificantly increased LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)-II \nand SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) protein levels with autophagosome accumulation. \nAt the molecular level, intracellular MAPT aggregation inhibited expression of \nIST1 (IST1 factor associated with ESCRT-III), a positive modulator for the \nformation of ESCRT (the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) \ncomplex that is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Upregulating IST1 in \nhuman MAPT transgenic mice attenuated autophagy deficit with reduced MAPT \naggregation and ameliorated synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, while \ndownregulating IST1 per se induced autophagy deficit with impaired synapse and \ncognitive function in naïve mice. IST1 can facilitate association of CHMP2B \n(charged multivesicular body protein 2B) and CHMP4B/SNF7-2 to form ESCRT-III \ncomplex, while lack of IST1 impeded the complex formation. Finally, we \ndemonstrate that MAPT accumulation suppresses IST1 transcription with the \nmechanisms involving the ANP32A-regulated mask of histone acetylation. Our \nfindings suggest that the AD-like MAPT accumulation can repress \nautophagosome-lysosome fusion by deregulating ANP32A-INHAT-IST1-ESCRT-III \npathway, which also reveals a vicious cycle of MAPT accumulation and autophagy \ndeficit in the chronic course of AD neurodegeneration.",

One of the affected factors, U2AF1, is involved in \nsplice site selection, and the most common change, S34F, alters a conserved \nnucleic acid-binding domain, recognition of the 3' splice site, and alternative \nsplicing of many mRNAs. However, the role that this mutation plays in \noncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we uncovered a noncanonical function of \nU2AF1, showing that it directly binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and \nnegatively regulates mRNA translation. This splicing-independent role of U2AF1 \nis altered by the S34F mutation, and polysome profiling indicates that the \nmutation affects translation of hundreds of mRNA.

To this end, we \ncarried out unbiased mass spectrometry-based metabolomic and proteomic profiling \nof cancer cells cocultured with primary human omental adipocytes. Cancer cells \nunderwent significant proteo-metabolomic alteration(s), typified by changes in \nthe lipidome with corresponding upregulation of lipid metabolism proteins. \nFABP4, a lipid chaperone protein, was identified as the critical regulator of \nlipid responses in ovarian cancer cells cocultured with adipocytes. \nSubsequently, knockdown of FABP4 resulted in increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine \nlevels in the DNA, downregulation of gene signatures associated with ovarian \ncancer metastasis, and reduced clonogenic cancer cell survival. In addition, \nclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated \nknockout of FABP4 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells reduced metastatic \ntumor burden in mice. Consequently, a small-molecule inhibitor of FABP4 \n(BMS309403) not only significantly reduced tumor burden in a syngeneic \northotopic mouse model but also increased the sensitivity of cancer cells toward \ncarboplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results show that \ntargeting FABP4 in ovarian cancer cells can inhibit their ability to adapt and \ncolonize lipid-rich tumor microenvironments, providing an opportunity for \nspecific metabolic targeting of ovarian cancer metastasis.

Here we show that proteostasis and stress \nresilience are also regulated by embryo-to-mother communication in reproductive \nadults. To identify genes that act directly in the reproductive system to \nregulate somatic proteostasis, we performed a tissue targeted genetic screen for \ngermline modifiers of polyglutamine aggregation in muscle cells. We found that \ninhibiting the formation of the extracellular vitelline layer of the fertilized \nembryo inside the uterus suppresses aggregation, improves stress resilience in \nan HSF-1-dependent manner, and restores the heat-shock response in the somatic \ntissues of the parent. This pathway relies on DAF-16/FOXO activation in vulval \ntissues to maintain stress resilience in the mother, suggesting that the \nintegrity of the embryo is monitored by the vulva to detect damage and initiate \nan organismal protective response. Our findings reveal a previously undescribed \ntranscellular pathway that links the integrity of the developing progeny to \nproteostasis regulation in the parent.",

Here we generated \nconstitutive wdr45 knockout (KO) mice that displayed cognitive impairments, \nabnormal synaptic transmission and lesions in several brain regions. \nImmunohistochemistry analysis showed loss of neurons in prefrontal cortex and \nbasal ganglion in aged mice, and increased apoptosis in prefrontal cortex, \nrecapitulating a hallmark of neurodegeneration.

The unfolded protein \nresponse (UPR) was elevated through ERN1/IRE1 or EIF2AK3/PERK pathway, and \neventually led to neuronal apoptosis.

In this study, we uncover distinct and novel \nfunctions for these kinases in regulating tumor formation and metastatic \ncolonization in various solid tumors, including those of the breast, prostate, \nand pancreas. Combining in vivo CRISPR-based CDK4 and CDK6 gene editing with \npharmacologic inhibition approaches in orthotopic transplantation and \npatient-derived xenograft preclinical models, we defined clear functions for \nCDK4 and CDK6 in facilitating tumor growth and progression in metastatic \ncancers. Transcriptomic profiling of CDK4/6 CRISPR knockouts in breast cancer \nrevealed these two kinases to regulate cancer progression through distinct \nmechanisms. CDK4 regulated prometastatic inflammatory cytokine signaling, \nwhereas CDK6 mainly controlled DNA replication and repair processes. Inhibition \nof CDK6 but not CDK4 resulted in defective DNA repair and increased DNA damage. \nMultiple CDK6 DNA replication/repair genes were not only associated with cancer \nsubtype, grades, and poor clinical outcomes, but also facilitated primary tumor \ngrowth and metastasis in vivo. CRISPR-based genomic deletion of CDK6 efficiently \nblocked tumor formation and progression in preestablished cell- and \npatient-derived xenograft preclinical models of breast cancer, providing a \npotential novel targeted therapy for these deadly tumors.",

Based on our previous studies that identified the SUMO2/3-specific \npeptidase SENP3 as an oxidative stress-responsive molecule, we investigated the \ncorrelation between SUMOylation and macroautophagy/autophagy. We found that \nSenp3± mice showed increased autophagy in the liver under basal and fasting \nconditions, compared to Senp3+/+ mice. We constructed a liver-specific senp3 \nknockout mouse; these Senp3-deficient liver tissues showed increased autophagy \nas well. Autophagic flux was accelerated in hepatic and other cell lines \nfollowing knockdown of SENP3, both before and after the cells underwent \nstarvation in the form of the serum and amino acid deprivation. We demonstrated \nthat BECN1/beclin 1, the core molecule of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, could be \nSUMO3-conjugated by PIAS3 predominantly at K380 and deSUMOylated by SENP3. The \nbasal SUMOylation of BECN1 was increased upon cellular starvation, which \nenhanced autophagosome formation by facilitating BECN1 interaction with other \ncomplex components UVRAG, PIK3C3 and ATG14, thus promoting PIK3C3 activity. In \ncontrast, SENP3 deSUMOylated BECN1, which impaired BECN1-PIK3C3 complex \nformation or stability to suppress the PIK3C3 activity. DeSUMOylation of BECN1 \nrestrained autophagy induction under basal conditions and especially upon \nstarvation when SENP3 had accumulated in response to the increased generation of \nreactive oxygen species. Thus, while reversible SUMOylation regulated the degree \nof autophagy, SENP3 provided an intrinsic overflow valve for fine-tuning \nautophagy induction.",

            "TEXT": "PRKN-regulated mitophagy and cellular senescence during COPD pathogenesis.\n\nCigarette smoke (CS)-induced accumulation of mitochondrial damage has been \nwidely implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. \nMitophagy plays a crucial role in eliminating damaged mitochondria, and is \ngoverned by the PINK1 (PTEN induced putative protein kinase 1)-PRKN (parkin RBR \nE3 ubiquitin protein ligase) pathway. Although both increased PINK1 and reduced \nPRKN have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis in association with mitophagy, \nthere are conflicting reports for the role of mitophagy in COPD progression. To \nclarify the involvement of PRKN-regulated mitophagy in COPD pathogenesis, prkn \nknockout (KO) mouse models were used. To illuminate how PINK1 and PRKN regulate \nmitophagy in relation to CS-induced mitochondrial damage and cellular \nsenescence, overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in airway \nepithelial cells (AEC). In comparison to wild-type mice, prkn KO mice \ndemonstrated enhanced airway wall thickening with emphysematous changes \nfollowing CS exposure. AEC in CS-exposed prkn KO mice showed accumulation of \ndamaged mitochondria and increased oxidative modifications accompanied by \naccelerated cellular senescence. In vitro experiments showed PRKN overexpression \nwas sufficient to induce mitophagy during CSE exposure even in the setting of \nreduced PINK1 protein levels, resulting in attenuation of mitochondrial ROS \nproduction and cellular senescence. Conversely PINK1 overexpression failed to \nrecover impaired mitophagy caused by PRKN knockdown, indicating that PRKN \nprotein levels can be the rate-limiting factor in PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy \nduring CSE exposure. These results suggest that PRKN levels may play a pivotal \nrole in COPD pathogenesis by regulating mitophagy, suggesting that PRKN \ninduction could mitigate the progression of COPD.",

As such, new targets and \ntherapeutic strategies are urgently required. Here, we show that bone \nmorphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) blocks metastasis in animal models of breast \ncancer and predicts improved survival in patients. In preclinical models of \nspontaneous metastasis, BMP4 acted as an autocrine mediator to modulate a range \nof known metastasis-regulating genes, including Smad7, via activation of \ncanonical BMP-SMAD signaling. Restored BMP4 expression or therapeutically \nadministered BMP4 protein, blocked metastasis and increased survival by \nsensitizing cancer cells to anoikis, thereby reducing the number of circulating \ntumor cells. Gene silencing of Bmp4 or its downstream mediator Smad7, reversed \nthis phenotype. Administration of recombinant BMP4 markedly reduced spontaneous \nmetastasis to lung and bone. Elevated levels of BMP4 and SMAD7 were prognostic \nfor improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients with \nbreast cancer, indicating the importance of canonical BMP4 signaling in the \nsuppression of metastasis and highlighting new avenues for therapy against \nmetastatic disease.",

            "TEXT": "AMPK activation does not enhance autophagy in neurons in contrast to MTORC1 \ninhibition: different impact on β-amyloid clearance.\n\nThe physiological AKT-MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways are considered key \nnodes in the regulation of anabolism-catabolism, and particularly of \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Indeed, it is reported that these are altered \nprocesses in neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD), \nmainly characterized by deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated MAPT. \nThese accumulations disrupt the optimal neuronal proteostasis, and hence, the \nrecovery/enhancement of autophagy has been proposed as a therapeutic approach \nagainst these proteinopathies. The purpose of the present study was to \ncharacterize the modulation of autophagy by MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways \nin the highly specialized neurons, as well as their repercussions on Aβ \nproduction. Using a double transgenic mice model of AD, we demonstrated that \nMTORC1 inhibition, either in vivo or ex vivo (primary neuronal cultures), was \nable to reduce amyloid secretion through moderate autophagy induction in \nneurons. The pharmacological prevention of autophagy in neurons augmented the Aβ \nsecretion and reversed the effect of rapamycin, confirming the \nanti-amyloidogenic effects of autophagy in neurons. Inhibition of AMPK with \ncompound C generated the expected decrease in autophagy induction, though \nsurprisingly did not increase the Aβ secretion. In contrast, increased activity \nof AMPK with metformin, AICAR, 2DG, or by gene overexpression did not enhance \nautophagy but had different effects on Aβ secretion: whereas metformin and 2DG \ndiminished the secreted Aβ levels, AICAR and PRKAA1/AMPK gene overexpression \nincreased them. We conclude that AMPK has a significantly different role in \nprimary neurons than in other reported cells, lacking a direct effect on \nautophagy-dependent amyloidosis.",

            "TEXT": "Mitophagy regulates mitochondrial network signaling, oxidative stress, and \napoptosis during myoblast differentiation.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a degradative process essential for various cellular \nprocesses. We previously demonstrated that autophagy-deficiency causes myoblast \napoptosis and impairs myotube formation. In this study, we continued this work \nwith particular emphasis on mitochondrial remodelling and stress/apoptotic \nsignaling. We found increased (p < 0.05) autophagic (e.g., altered LC3B levels, \nincreased ATG7, decreased SQSTM1) and mitophagic (e.g., BNIP3 upregulation, \nmitochondrial localized GFP-LC3 puncta, and elevated mitochondrial LC3B-II) \nsignaling during myoblast differentiation. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7 \n(shAtg7) decreased these autophagic and mitophagic responses, while increasing \nCASP3 activity and ANXA5/annexin V staining in differentiating myoblasts; \nultimately resulting in dramatically impaired myogenesis. Further confirming the \nimportance of mitophagy in these responses, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of \nBnip3 (bnip3-/-) resulted in increased CASP3 activity and DNA fragmentation as \nwell as impaired myoblast differentiation. In addition, shAtg7 myoblasts \ndisplayed greater endoplasmic reticulum (e.g., increased CAPN activity and HSPA) \nand mitochondrial (e.g., mPTP formation, reduced mitochondrial membrane \npotential, elevated mitochondrial 4-HNE) stress. shAtg7 and bnip3-/- myoblasts \nalso displayed altered mitochondria-associated signaling (e.g., PPARGC1A, DNM1L, \nOPA1) and protein content (e.g., SLC25A4, VDAC1, CYCS). Moreover, shAtg7 \nmyoblasts displayed CYCS and AIFM1 release from mitochondria, and CASP9 \nactivation. Similarly, bnip3-/- myoblasts had significantly higher CASP9 \nactivation during differentiation. Importantly, administration of a chemical \ninhibitor of CASP9 (Ac-LEHD-CHO) or dominant-negative CASP9 (ad-DNCASP9) \npartially recovered differentiation and myogenesis in shAtg7 myoblasts. \nTogether, these data demonstrate an essential role for autophagy in protecting \nmyoblasts from mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling during \ndifferentiation, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial network \nremodelling and myogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "Blocking SHH/Patched Interaction Triggers Tumor Growth Inhibition through \nPatched-Induced Apoptosis.\n\nThe Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway plays a key role in cancer. Alterations of SHH \ncanonical signaling, causally linked to tumor progression, have become rational \ntargets for cancer therapy. However, Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors have failed to \nshow clinical benefit in patients with cancers displaying SHH \nautocrine/paracrine expression. We reported earlier that the SHH receptor \nPatched (PTCH) is a dependence receptor that triggers apoptosis in the absence \nof SHH through a pathway that differs from the canonical one, thus generating a \nstate of dependence on SHH for survival. Here, we propose a dual function for \nSHH: its binding to PTCH not only activates the SHH canonical pathway but also \nblocks PTCH-induced apoptosis. Eighty percent, 64%, and 8% of human colon, \npancreatic, and lung cancer cells, respectively, overexpressed SHH at \ntranscriptional and protein levels. In addition, SHH-overexpressing cells \nexpressed all the effectors of the PTCH-induced apoptotic pathway. Although the \ncanonical pathway remained unchanged, autocrine SHH interference in colon, \npancreatic, and lung cell lines triggered cell death through PTCH proapoptotic \nsignaling. In vivo, SHH interference in colon cancer cell lines decreased \nprimary tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the antitumor effect associated \nto SHH deprivation, usually thought to be a consequence of the inactivation of \nthe canonical SHH pathway, is, at least in part, because of the engagement of \nPTCH proapoptotic activity. Together, these data strongly suggest that \ntherapeutic strategies based on the disruption of SHH/PTCH interaction in \nSHH-overexpressing cancers should be explored. SIGNIFICANCE: Sonic \nHedgehog-overexpressing tumors express PTCH-induced cell death effectors, \nsuggesting that this death signaling could be activated as an antitumor \nstrategy.",

            "TEXT": "m(6)A mRNA methylation controls autophagy and adipogenesis by targeting Atg5 and \nAtg7.\n\nN: 6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal modification on mRNAs in \neukaryotes, play roles in adipogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism \nremains largely unclear. Here, we show that m6A plays a critical role in \nregulating macroautophagy/autophagy and adipogenesis through targeting Atg5 and \nAtg7. Mechanistically, knockdown of FTO, a well-known m6A demethylase, decreased \nthe expression of ATG5 and ATG7, leading to attenuation of autophagosome \nformation, thereby inhibiting autophagy and adipogenesis. We proved that FTO \ndirectly targeted Atg5 and Atg7 transcripts and mediated their expression in an \nm6A-dependent manner. Further study identified that Atg5 and Atg7 were the \ntargets of YTHDF2 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2). Upon FTO \nsilencing, Atg5 and Atg7 transcripts with higher m6A levels were captured by \nYTHDF2, which resulted in mRNA degradation and reduction of protein expression, \nthus alleviating autophagy and adipogenesis. Furthermore, we generated an \nadipose-selective fto knockout mouse and find that FTO deficiency decreased \nwhite fat mass and impairs ATG5- and ATG7-dependent autophagy in vivo. Together, \nthese findings unveil the functional importance of the m6A methylation machinery \nin autophagy and adipogenesis regulation, which expands our understanding of \nsuch interplay that is essential for development of therapeutic strategies in \nthe prevention and treatment of obesity.",

Herein, we show that SIRT3 coordinates mitochondrial function and \nmacroautophagy/autophagy activation to promote anti-mycobacterial responses \nthrough PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha). SIRT3 \ndeficiency enhanced inflammatory responses and mitochondrial dysfunction, \nleading to defective host defense and pathological inflammation during \nmycobacterial infection. Antibody-mediated depletion of polymorphonuclear \nneutrophils significantly increased protection against mycobacterial infection \nin sirt3-/- mice. In addition, mitochondrial oxidative stress promoted excessive \ninflammation induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in sirt3-/- \nmacrophages. Notably, SIRT3 was essential for the enhancement of PPARA, a key \nregulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy activation in the context \nof infection. Importantly, overexpression of either PPARA or TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB) in sirt3-/- macrophages recovered antimicrobial activity through \nautophagy activation. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of SIRT3 enhanced \nantibacterial autophagy and functional mitochondrial pools during mycobacterial \ninfection. Finally, the levels of SIRT3 and PPARA were downregulated and \ninversely correlated with TNF (tumor necrosis factor) levels in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells from tuberculosis patients. Collectively, these data \ndemonstrate a previously unappreciated function of SIRT3 in orchestrating \nmitochondrial and autophagic functions to promote antimycobacterial responses.",

            "TEXT": "The AMPK-MFN2 axis regulates MAM dynamics and autophagy induced by energy \nstresses.\n\nEnergy deprivation activates the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein \nkinase (AMPK), which in turn induces macroautophagy/autophagy. The \nmitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM) plays a key role in mitochondrial \ndivision and autophagy, and the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 (mitofusin 2) \ntethers the MAM, but the mechanism by which AMPK and MFN2 regulate autophagy in \nresponse to energy stress remains unclear. Here, we found that energy stress not \nonly triggers mitochondrial fission and autophagy, but more importantly \nincreases the number of MAMs, a process that requires AMPK. Interestingly, under \nenergy stress, considerable amounts of AMPK translocate from cytosol to the MAM \nand the mitochondrion as mitochondrial fission occurs. Unexpectedly, AMPK \ninteracts directly with MFN2. The autophagic ability of mouse embryonic \nfibroblasts (MEFs) lacking MFN2 (mfn2-/-) is significantly attenuated in \nresponse to energy stress as compared to wild-type MEFs (WT MEFs), while \nre-expression of MFN2 in mfn2-/- cells rescues the autophagy defects of these \ncells. The abundance of MAMs is also greatly reduced in MFN2-deficient cells. \nFunctional experiments show that the oxygen consumption rate and the glycolytic \nfunction of cells lacking MFN2 but not MFN1 are obviously attenuated, and MFN2 \nis important for cell survival under energy stress. In conclusion, our study \nestablishes the molecular link between the energy sensor AMPK and the MAM tether \nMFN2, and reveals the important role of AMPK and MFN2 in energy stress-induced \nautophagy and MAM dynamics.",

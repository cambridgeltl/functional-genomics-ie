            "TEXT": "Blocking SHH/Patched Interaction Triggers Tumor Growth Inhibition through \nPatched-Induced Apoptosis.\n\nThe Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway plays a key role in cancer. Alterations of SHH \ncanonical signaling, causally linked to tumor progression, have become rational \ntargets for cancer therapy. However, Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors have failed to \nshow clinical benefit in patients with cancers displaying SHH \nautocrine/paracrine expression. We reported earlier that the SHH receptor \nPatched (PTCH) is a dependence receptor that triggers apoptosis in the absence \nof SHH through a pathway that differs from the canonical one, thus generating a \nstate of dependence on SHH for survival. Here, we propose a dual function for \nSHH: its binding to PTCH not only activates the SHH canonical pathway but also \nblocks PTCH-induced apoptosis. Eighty percent, 64%, and 8% of human colon, \npancreatic, and lung cancer cells, respectively, overexpressed SHH at \ntranscriptional and protein levels. In addition, SHH-overexpressing cells \nexpressed all the effectors of the PTCH-induced apoptotic pathway. Although the \ncanonical pathway remained unchanged, autocrine SHH interference in colon, \npancreatic, and lung cell lines triggered cell death through PTCH proapoptotic \nsignaling. In vivo, SHH interference in colon cancer cell lines decreased \nprimary tumor growth and metastasis. Therefore, the antitumor effect associated \nto SHH deprivation, usually thought to be a consequence of the inactivation of \nthe canonical SHH pathway, is, at least in part, because of the engagement of \nPTCH proapoptotic activity. Together, these data strongly suggest that \ntherapeutic strategies based on the disruption of SHH/PTCH interaction in \nSHH-overexpressing cancers should be explored. SIGNIFICANCE: Sonic \nHedgehog-overexpressing tumors express PTCH-induced cell death effectors, \nsuggesting that this death signaling could be activated as an antitumor \nstrategy.",

            "TEXT": "RNA-binding protein ZFP36/TTP protects against ferroptosis by regulating \nautophagy signaling pathway in hepatic stellate cells.\n\nFerroptosis is a recently discovered form of programmed cell death, but its \nregulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the \nRNA-binding protein ZFP36/TTP (ZFP36 ring finger protein) plays a crucial role \nin regulating ferroptosis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Upon exposure to \nferroptosis-inducing compounds, the ubiquitin ligase FBXW7/CDC4 (F-box and WD \nrepeat domain containing 7) decreased ZFP36 protein expression by recognizing \nSFSGLPS motif. FBXW7 plasmid contributed to classical ferroptotic events, \nwhereas ZFP36 plasmid impaired FBXW7 plasmid-induced HSC ferroptosis. \nInterestingly, ZFP36 plasmid inhibited macroautophagy/autophagy activation by \ndestabilizing ATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1) mRNA. ATG16L1 plasmid \neliminated the inhibitory action of ZFP36 plasmid on ferroptosis, and FBXW7 \nplasmid enhanced the effect of ATG16L1 plasmid on autophagy. Importantly, ZFP36 \nplasmid promoted ATG16L1 mRNA decay via binding to the AU-rich elements (AREs) \nwithin the 3'-untranslated region. The internal mutation of the ARE region \nabrogated the ZFP36-mediated ATG16L1 mRNA instability, and prevented ZFP36 \nplasmid-mediated ferroptosis resistance. In mice, treatment with erastin and \nsorafenib alleviated murine liver fibrosis by inducing HSC ferroptosis. \nHSC-specific overexpression of Zfp36 impaired erastin- or sorafenib-induced HSC \nferroptosis. Noteworthy, we analyzed the effect of sorafenib on HSC ferroptosis \nin fibrotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib \nmonotherapy. Attractively, sorafenib monotherapy led to ZFP36 downregulation, \nferritinophagy activation, and ferroptosis induction in human HSCs. Overall, \nthese results revealed novel molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of \nferroptosis, and also identified ZFP36-autophagy-dependent ferroptosis as a \npotential target for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

            "TEXT": "RING-finger protein 166 plays a novel pro-apoptotic role in neurotoxin-induced \nneurodegeneration via ubiquitination of XIAP.\n\nThe dopaminergic neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), has been widely \nutilized to establish experimental models of Parkinson disease and to reveal the \ncritical molecules and pathway underlying neuronal death. The profile of gene \nexpression changes following 6-OHDA treatment of MN9D dopaminergic neuronal \ncells was investigated using a TwinChip Mouse-7.4K microarray. Functional \nclustering of altered sets of genes identified RING-finger protein 166 (RNF166). \nRNF166 is composed of an N-terminal RING domain and C-terminal ubiquitin \ninteraction motif. RNF166 localized in the cytosol and nucleus. At the tissue \nlevel, RNF166 was widely expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral \norgans. In the cerebral cortex, its expression decreased over time. In certain \nconditions, overexpression of RNF166 accelerates the naturally occurring \nneuronal death and 6-OHDA-induced MN9D cell death as determined by TUNEL and \nannexin-V staining, and caspase activation. Consequently, 6-OHDA-induced \napoptotic cell death was attenuated in RNF166-knockdown cells. In an attempt to \nelucidate the mechanism underlying this pro-apoptotic activity, binding protein \nprofiles were assessed using the yeast two-hybrid system. Among several \npotential binding candidates, RNF166 was shown to interact with the cytoplasmic \nX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), inducing ubiquitin-dependent degradation \nof XIAP and eventually accelerating caspase activation following 6-OHDA \ntreatment. RNF166's interaction with and resulting inhibition of the XIAP \nanti-caspase activity was further enhanced by XIAP-associated factor-1 (XAF-1). \nConsequently, depletion of RNF166 suppressed 6-OHDA-induced caspase activation \nand apoptotic cell death, which was reversed by XIAP knockdown. In summary, our \ndata suggest that RNF166, a novel E3 ligase, plays a pro-apoptotic role via \ncaspase activation in neuronal cells.",

            "TEXT": "OTULIN protects the liver against cell death, inflammation, fibrosis, and \ncancer.\n\nMethionine-1 (M1)-linked polyubiquitin chains conjugated by the linear ubiquitin \nchain assembly complex (LUBAC) control NF-κB activation, immune homoeostasis, \nand prevents tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced cell death. The deubiquitinase \nOTULIN negatively regulates M1-linked polyubiquitin signalling by removing the \nchains conjugated by LUBAC, and OTULIN deficiency causes OTULIN-related \nautoinflammatory syndrome (ORAS) in humans. However, the cellular pathways and \nphysiological functions controlled by OTULIN remain poorly understood. Here, we \nshow that OTULIN prevents development of liver disease in mice and humans. In an \nORAS patient, OTULIN deficiency caused spontaneous and progressive steatotic \nliver disease at 10-13 months of age. Similarly, liver-specific deletion of \nOTULIN in mice leads to neonatally onset steatosis and hepatitis, akin to the \nORAS patient. OTULIN deficiency triggers metabolic alterations, apoptosis, and \ninflammation in the liver. In mice, steatosis progresses to steatohepatitis, \nfibrosis and pre-malignant tumour formation by 8 weeks of age, and by the age of \n7-12 months the phenotype has advanced to malignant hepatocellular carcinoma. \nSurprisingly, the pathology in OTULIN-deficient livers is independent of TNFR1 \nsignalling. Instead, we find that steatohepatitis in OTULIN-deficient livers is \nassociated with aberrant mTOR activation, and inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin \nadministration significantly reduces the liver pathology. Collectively, our \nresults reveal that OTULIN is critical for maintaining liver homoeostasis and \nsuggest that M1-linked polyubiquitin chains may play a role in regulation of \nmTOR signalling and metabolism in the liver.",

            "TEXT": "RALB GTPase: a critical regulator of DR5 expression and TRAIL sensitivity in \nKRAS mutant colorectal cancer.\n\nRAS mutant (MT) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is resistant to MEK1/2 \ninhibition and remains a difficult-to-treat group. Therefore, there is an unmet \nneed for novel treatment options for RASMT mCRC. RALA and RALB GTPases function \ndownstream of RAS and have been found to be key regulators of several cell \nfunctions implicated in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis. However, their role as \nregulators of the apoptotic machinery remains to be elucidated. Here, we found \nthat inhibition of RALB expression, but not RALA, resulted in \nCaspase-8-dependent cell death in KRASMT CRC cells, which was not further \nincreased following MEK1/2 inhibition. Proteomic analysis and mechanistic \nstudies revealed that RALB depletion induced a marked upregulation of the \npro-apoptotic cell surface TRAIL Death Receptor 5 (DR5) (also known as \nTRAIL-R2), primarily through modulating DR5 protein lysosomal degradation. \nMoreover, DR5 knockdown or knockout attenuated siRALB-induced apoptosis, \nconfirming the role of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway as a regulator of \nsiRALB-induced cell death. Importantly, TRAIL treatment resulted in the \nassociation of RALB with the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and \ntargeting RALB using pharmacologic inhibition or RNAi approaches triggered a \npotent increase in TRAIL-induced cell death in KRASMT CRC cells. Significantly, \nhigh RALB mRNA levels were found in the poor prognostic Colorectal Cancer \nIntrinsic Subtypes (CRIS)-B CRC subgroup. Collectively, this study provides to \nour knowledge the first evidence for a role for RALB in apoptotic priming and \nsuggests that RALB inhibition may be a promising strategy to improve response to \nTRAIL treatment in poor prognostic RASMT CRIS-B CRC.",

The metastatic \nmicroenvironment is essential to facilitate growth of disseminated tumor cells. \nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are prominent players in the \nmicroenvironment of breast cancer. However, their role in the formation of a \npermissive metastatic niche is unresolved. Here we show that IL33 is upregulated \nin metastases-associated fibroblasts in mouse models of spontaneous breast \ncancer metastasis and in patients with breast cancer with lung metastasis. \nUpregulation of IL33 instigated type 2 inflammation in the metastatic \nmicroenvironment and mediated recruitment of eosinophils, neutrophils, and \ninflammatory monocytes to lung metastases. Importantly, targeting of IL33 in \nvivo resulted in inhibition of lung metastasis and significant attenuation of \nimmune cell recruitment and type 2 immunity. These findings demonstrate a key \nfunction of IL33 in facilitating lung metastatic relapse by modulating the \nimmune microenvironment. Our study shows a novel interaction axis between CAF \nand immune cells and reveals the central role of CAF in establishing a \nhospitable inflammatory niche in lung metastasis.",

Many patients with ovarian cancer suffer from de novo or acquired \nresistance to chemotherapy. Here, we report that RAB25 suppresses \nchemotherapy-induced mitochondrial apoptosis signaling in ovarian cancer cell \nlines and primary ovarian cancer cells. RAB25 blocks chemotherapy-induced \napoptosis upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by either \nincreasing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins or decreasing proapoptotic BCL-2 \nproteins. In particular, BAX expression negatively correlates with RAB25 \nexpression in ovarian cancer cells. BH3 profiling assays corroborated that RAB25 \ndecreases mitochondrial cell death priming. Suppressing RAB25 by means of RNAi \nor RFP14 inhibitory hydrocarbon-stapled peptide sensitizes ovarian cancer cells \nto chemotherapy as well as RAB25-mediated proliferation, invasion and migration. \nOur data suggest that RAB25 is a potential therapeutic target for ovarian \ncancer.",

Therefore, inhibitors of AURKB induce \nprominent MYC degradation concomitant with robust leukemia cell death.

            "TEXT": "NOX4 Inhibition Potentiates Immunotherapy by Overcoming Cancer-Associated \nFibroblast-Mediated CD8 T-cell Exclusion from Tumors.\n\nDetermining mechanisms of resistance to αPD-1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint \nimmunotherapy is key to developing new treatment strategies. Cancer-associated \nfibroblasts (CAF) have many tumor-promoting functions and promote immune evasion \nthrough multiple mechanisms, but as yet, no CAF-specific inhibitors are \nclinically available. Here we generated CAF-rich murine tumor models (TC1, MC38, \nand 4T1) to investigate how CAFs influence the immune microenvironment and \naffect response to different immunotherapy modalities [anticancer vaccination, \nTC1 (HPV E7 DNA vaccine), αPD-1, and MC38] and found that CAFs broadly \nsuppressed response by specifically excluding CD8+ T cells from tumors (not CD4+ \nT cells or macrophages); CD8+ T-cell exclusion was similarly present in CAF-rich \nhuman tumors. RNA sequencing of CD8+ T cells from CAF-rich murine tumors and \nimmunochemistry analysis of human tumors identified significant upregulation of \nCTLA-4 in the absence of other exhaustion markers; inhibiting CTLA-4 with a \nnondepleting antibody overcame the CD8+ T-cell exclusion effect without \naffecting Tregs. We then examined the potential for CAF targeting, focusing on \nthe ROS-producing enzyme NOX4, which is upregulated by CAF in many human \ncancers, and compared this with TGFβ1 inhibition, a key regulator of the CAF \nphenotype. siRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition [GKT137831 (Setanaxib)] \nof NOX4 \"normalized\" CAF to a quiescent phenotype and promoted intratumoral CD8+ \nT-cell infiltration, overcoming the exclusion effect; TGFβ1 inhibition could \nprevent, but not reverse, CAF differentiation. Finally, NOX4 inhibition restored \nimmunotherapy response in CAF-rich tumors. These findings demonstrate that \nCAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance can be effectively overcome through NOX4 \ninhibition and could improve outcome in a broad range of cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: \nNOX4 is critical for maintaining the immune-suppressive CAF phenotype in tumors. \nPharmacologic inhibition of NOX4 potentiates immunotherapy by overcoming \nCAF-mediated CD8+ T-cell exclusion.",

To determine how stromal SNAI2 \nmight influence HER2+ tumor behavior, Snai2-deficient mice were crossed with a \nmouse line carrying the ErbB2/Neu protooncogene to generate HER2+/ERBB2+ breast \ncancer. Tumors generated in this model expressed SNAI2 in the stroma but not the \nepithelium, allowing for the role of stromal SNAI2 to be studied without \ninterference from the epithelial compartment. The absence of SNAI2 in the stroma \nof HER2+/ERBB2+ tumors is associated with: (i) lower levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) \nand reduced tumor epithelium proliferation; (ii) higher levels of AKT and a \nlower incidence of metastasis; (iii) lower levels of angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), \nand more necrosis. Together, these results indicate that the loss of SNAI2 in \ncancer-associated fibroblasts limits the production of some cytokines, which \ninfluences AKT/ERK tumor signaling and subsequent proliferative and metastatic \ncapacity of ERBB2+ breast cancer cells. Accordingly, SNAI2 expression in the \nstroma enhanced the tumorigenicity of luminal B HER2+/ERBB2+ breast cancers. \nThis work emphasizes the importance of stromal SNAI2 in breast cancer \nprogression and patients' prognosis.",

In this study we show that \nmutations in HSPB1 lead to impairment of macroautophagic/autophagic flux. In \nHSPB1 knockout cells, we demonstrate that HSPB1 is necessary for autophagosome \nformation, which was rescued upon re-expression of HSPB1. Employing a label-free \nLC-MS/MS analysis on the various HSPB1 variants (wild type and mutants), we \nidentified autophagy-specific interactors. We reveal that the wild-type HSPB1 \nprotein binds to the autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 and that the PB1 domain of \nSQSTM1 is essential for this interaction. Mutations in HSPB1 lead to a decrease \nin the formation of SQSTM1/p62 bodies, and subsequent impairment of phagophore \nformation, suggesting a regulatory role for HSPB1 in autophagy via interaction \nwith SQSTM1. Remarkably, autophagy deficits could also be confirmed in \npatient-derived motor neurons thereby indicating that the impairment of \nautophagy might be one of the pathomechanisms by which mutations in HSPB1 lead \nto peripheral neuropathy.",

Here, we reported that TRAF6, an E3 \nubiquitin ligase important for inflammatory signaling, inhibited \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and CRC metastasis through driving a \nselective autophagic CTNNB1 degradation machinery. Mechanistically, TRAF6 \ninteracted with MAP1LC3B/LC3B through its LC3-interacting region 'YxxL' and \ncatalyzed K63-linked polyubiquitination of LC3B. The K63-linked ubiquitination \nof LC3B promoted the formation of the LC3B-ATG7 complex and was critical to the \nsubsequent recognition of CTNNB1 by LC3B for the selective autophagic \ndegradation. However, TRAF6 was phosphorylated at Thr266 by GSK3B in most \nclinical CRC, which triggered K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of \nTRAF6 and thereby attenuated its inhibitory activity towards the \nautophagy-dependent CTNNB1 signaling. Clinically, decreased expression of TRAF6 \nwas associated with elevated GSK3B protein levels and activity and reduced \noverall survival in CRC patients. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B activity \nstabilized the TRAF6 protein, promoted CTNNB1 degradation, and effectively \nsuppressed EMT and CRC metastasis. Thus, targeting TRAF6 and its pathway may be \nmeaningful for treating advanced CRC.",

Although the CQ-CDDP combination decreased \nprotein expression of ATM and ATR, phosphorylation of ATM was increased and \nexpression of p21WAF1/CIP1 was also increased in CQ-CDDP-treated cells. \nKnockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1 by shRNA reduced the expression of γH2AX and \nphosphorylated ATM and inhibited caspase-3 activity but induced ATM protein \nexpression. Knockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1 partly inhibited CQ-CDDP-induced G2/M \narrest, demonstrating that knockdown of p21WAF1/CIP1 overcame the cytotoxic \neffect of the CQ-CDDP combination. Ectopic expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 in \nCDDP-treated ATG5-shRNA/A2780-CP20 cells increased expression of γH2AX and \ncaspase-3 activity, demonstrating increased DNA damage and cell death.

In an in vivo efficacy study, the \nCQ-CDDP combination significantly decreased tumor weight and increased \nexpression of γH2AX and p21WAF1/CIP1 in A2780-CP20 orthotopic xenografts and a \ndrug-resistant patient-derived xenograft model of EOC compared with controls. \nThese results demonstrated that CQ increases cytotoxicity in combination with \nCDDP by inducing lethal DNA damage by induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression and \nautophagy inhibition in CDDP-resistant EOC.",

            "TEXT": "TAK1 suppresses RIPK1-dependent cell death and is associated with disease \nprogression in melanoma.\n\nMelanoma cells are highly resistant to conventional genotoxic agents, and \nBRAFV600/MEK-targeted therapies as well as immunotherapies frequently remain \ninefficient. Alternative means to treat melanoma, in particular through the \ninduction of programmed cell death modalities such as apoptosis or necroptosis, \ntherefore still need to be explored. Here, we report that melanoma cell lines \nexpressing notable amounts of RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL, the key players of \nnecroptosis signal transduction, fail to execute necroptotic cell death. \nInterestingly, the activity of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 \n(TAK1) appears to prevent RIPK1 from contributing to cell death induction, since \nTAK1 inhibition by (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol, deletion of MAP3K7 or the expression of \ninactive TAK1 were sufficient to sensitize melanoma cells to RIPK1-dependent \ncell death in response to TNFα or TRAIL based combination treatments. However, \ncell death was executed exclusively by apoptosis, even when RIPK3 expression was \nhigh. In addition, TAK1 inhibitor (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol suppressed intrinsic or \ntreatment-induced pro-survival signaling as well as the secretion of cytokines \nand soluble factors associated with melanoma disease progression. \nCorrespondingly, elevated expression of TAK1 correlates with reduced disease \nfree survival in patients diagnosed with primary melanoma. Overall, our results \ntherefore demonstrate that TAK1 suppresses the susceptibility to RIPK1-dependent \ncell death and that high expression of TAK1 indicates an increased risk for \ndisease progression in melanoma.",

            "TEXT": "Small GTPase RAB6 deficiency promotes alveolar progenitor cell renewal and \nattenuates PM2.5-induced lung injury and fibrosis.\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease \ncharacterized by chronic non-specific inflammation of the interstitial lung and \nextensive deposition of collagen fibers leading to destruction of lung function. \nStudies have demonstrated that exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) \nincreases the risk of IPF. In order to recover from PM2.5-induced lung injury, \nalveolar epithelial cells need to be repaired and regenerated to maintain lung \nfunction. Type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) are stem cells in the adult \nlung that contribute to the lung repair process through complex signaling. Our \nprevious studies demonstrated that RAB6, a RAS family member lowly expressed in \nlung cancer, inhibited lung cancer stem cell self-renewal, but it is unclear \nwhether or not and how RAB6 may regulate AEC2 cell proliferation and \nself-renewal in PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we demonstrated that \nknockout of RAB6 inhibited pulmonary fibrosis, oxidative stress, and AEC2 cell \ndeath in PM2.5-injured mice. In addition, knockout of RAB6 decreased Dickkopf \n1(DKK1) autocrine and activated proliferation, self-renewal, and wnt/β-catenin \nsignaling of PM2.5-injured AEC2 cells. RAB6 overexpression increased DKK1 \nautocrine and inhibited proliferation, self-renewal and wnt/β-catenin signaling \nin AEC2 cells in vitro. Furthermore, DKK1 inhibitors promoted proliferation, \nself-renewal and wnt/β-catenin signaling of RAB6 overexpressing AEC2 cells, and \nattenuated PM2.5-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. These data establish RAB6 \nas a regulator of DKK1 autocrine and wnt/β-catenin signal that serves to \nregulate AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal, and suggest a mechanism that \nRAB6 disruption may promote AEC2 cell proliferation and self-renewal to enhance \nlung repair following PM2.5 injury.",

Blockade of ERK1/2 \nreactivation following EGFR TKI treatment by combined EGFR/MEK inhibition \nuncovers cells that survive by entering a senescence-like dormant state \ncharacterized by high YAP/TEAD activity. YAP/TEAD engage the \nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition transcription factor SLUG to directly \nrepress pro-apoptotic BMF, limiting drug-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological \nco-inhibition of YAP and TEAD, or genetic deletion of YAP1, all deplete dormant \ncells by enhancing EGFR/MEK inhibition-induced apoptosis. Enhancing the initial \nefficacy of targeted therapies could ultimately lead to prolonged treatment \nresponses in cancer patients.",

Here we generated \nconstitutive wdr45 knockout (KO) mice that displayed cognitive impairments, \nabnormal synaptic transmission and lesions in several brain regions. \nImmunohistochemistry analysis showed loss of neurons in prefrontal cortex and \nbasal ganglion in aged mice, and increased apoptosis in prefrontal cortex, \nrecapitulating a hallmark of neurodegeneration. Quantitative proteomic analysis \nshowed accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins in KO mouse. At the \ncellular level, accumulation of ER proteins due to WDR45 deficiency resulted in \nincreased ER stress and impaired ER quality control. The unfolded protein \nresponse (UPR) was elevated through ERN1/IRE1 or EIF2AK3/PERK pathway, and \neventually led to neuronal apoptosis. Suppression of ER stress or activation of \nautophagy through MTOR inhibition alleviated cell death. Thus, the loss of WDR45 \ncripples macroautophagy machinery in neurons and leads to impairment in \norganelle autophagy, which provides a mechanistic understanding of cause of BPAN \nand a potential therapeutic strategy to treat this genetic \ndisorder.",

            "TEXT": "Splicing factor SF3B1 promotes endometrial cancer progression via regulating \nKSR2 RNA maturation.\n\nAlthough endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of the female reproductive \ntract, we have little understanding of what controls endometrial cancer beyond \nthe transcriptional effects of steroid hormones such as estrogen. As a result, \nwe have limited therapeutic options for the ~62,000 women diagnosed with \nendometrial cancer each year in the United States. Here, in an attempt to \nidentify new prognostic and therapeutic targets, we focused on a new area for \nthis cancer-alternative mRNA splicing-and investigated whether splicing factor, \nSF3B1, plays an important role in endometrial cancer pathogenesis. Using a \ntissue microarray, we found that human endometrial tumors expressed more SF3B1 \nprotein than non-cancerous tissues. Furthermore, SF3B1 knockdown reduced in \nvitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of the endometrial cancer cell \nlines Ishikawa and AN3CA. Similarly, the SF3B1 inhibitor, Pladienolide-B \n(PLAD-B), reduced the Ishikawa and AN3CA cell proliferation and invasion in \nvitro. Moreover, PLAD-B reduced tumor growth in an orthotopic endometrial cancer \nmouse model. Using RNA-Seq approach, we identified ~2000 differentially \nexpressed genes (DEGs) with SF3B1 knockdown in endometrial cancer cells. \nAdditionally, alternative splicing (AS) events analysis revealed that SF3B1 \ndepletion led to alteration in multiple categories of AS events including \nalternative exon skipping (ES), transcript start site usage (TSS), and \ntranscript termination site (TTS) usage. Subsequently, bioinformatics analysis \nshowed KSR2 as a potential candidate for SF3B1-mediated functions in endometrial \ncancer. Specifically, loss of SF3B1 led to decrease in KSR2 expression, owing to \nreduced maturation of KSR2 pre-mRNA to a mature RNA. Importantly, we found \nrescuing the KSR2 expression with SF3B1 knockdown partially restored the cell \ngrowth of endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, our data suggest that SF3B1 \nplays a crucial oncogenic role in the tumorigenesis of endometrial cancer and \nhence may support the development of SF3B1 inhibitors to treat this disease.",

However, the mechanisms \nby which lysosomal membranes become leaky in vivo are not clear. Our data \ndemonstrate that LMP occurs in neurons following controlled cortical impact \ninduced (CCI) traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice, leading to impaired \nmacroautophagy (autophagy) and neuronal cell death. Comparison of LC-MS/MS \nlysosomal membrane lipid profiles from TBI and sham animals suggested a role for \nPLA2G4A/cPLA2 (phospholipase A2, group IVA [cytosolic, calcium-dependent]) in \nTBI-induced LMP. Activation of PLA2G4A caused LMP and inhibition of autophagy \nflux in cell lines and primary neurons. In vivo pharmacological inhibition of \nPLA2G4A attenuated TBI-induced LMP, as well as subsequent impairment of \nautophagy and neuronal loss, and was associated with improved neurological \noutcomes. Inhibition of PLA2G4A in vitro limited amyloid-β-induced LMP and \ninhibition of autophagy. Together, our data indicate that PLA2G4A -mediated \nlysosomal membrane damage is involved in neuronal cell death following \nCCI-induced TBI and potentially in other neurodegenerative \ndisorders.",

            "TEXT": "Dclk1 in tuft cells promotes inflammation-driven epithelial restitution and \nmitigates chronic colitis.\n\nUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by \ndefective intestinal barrier integrity toward the microbiota and epithelial \ndamage. Double cortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), a marker of intestinal tuft cells, \ncan regulate tissue regenerative responses, but its role in epithelial repair \nduring bacterial-dependent chronic colitis is unclear. We addressed this \nquestion using our recently developed mouse model of spontaneous \nmicrobiota-dependent colitis induced by mucin-type O-glycan deficiency (DKO), \nwhich recapitulates most features of human UC. We generated DKO mice lacking \nintestinal epithelial Dclk1 (DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC) and analyzed colitis onset and \nseverity using clinical and histologic indices, immune responses by qPCR and \nimmunostaining, and epithelial responses using proliferation markers and \norganoid culture. We found 3-4-week-old DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC mice developed worsened \nspontaneous colitis characterized by reduced body weight, loose stool, severe \ncolon thickening, epithelial lesions, and inflammatory cell infiltrates compared \nwith DKO mice. The primary defect was an impaired epithelial proliferative \nresponse during inflammation. Dclk1 deficiency also reduced inflammation-induced \nproliferation and growth of colon organoids ex vivo. Mechanistically, Dclk1 \nexpression was important for inflammation-induced Cox2 expression and \nprostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in vivo, and PGE2 rescued proliferative \ndefects in Dclk1-deficient colonic organoids. Although tuft cells were expanded \nin both DKO and DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC relative to WT mice, loss of Dclk1 was associated \nwith reduced tuft cell activation (i.e., proliferation) during inflammation. \nSimilar results were found in DKO vs. DKO;Dclk1ΔIEC mice at 3-6 months of age. \nOur results support that tuft cells, via Dclk1, are important responders to \nbacterial-induced colitis by enhancing epithelial repair responses, which in \nturn limits bacterial infiltration into the mucosa.",

            "TEXT": "ADORA1 Inhibition Promotes Tumor Immune Evasion by Regulating the ATF3-PD-L1 \nAxis.\n\nHere, we show that tumor ADORA1 deletion suppresses cell growth in human \nmelanoma cell lines in vitro and tumor development in vivo in immune-deficient \nxenografts. However, this deletion induces the upregulation of PD-L1 levels, \nwhich inactivates cocultured T cells in vitro, compromises anti-tumor immunity \nin vivo, and reduces anti-tumor efficacy in an immune-competent mouse model. \nFunctionally, PD-1 mAb treatment enhances the efficacy of ADORA1-deficient or \nADORA1 antagonist-treated melanoma and NSCLC immune-competent mouse models. \nMechanistically, we identify ATF3 as the factor transcriptionally upregulating \nPD-L1 expression. Tumor ATF3 deletion improves the effect of ADORA1 antagonist \ntreatment of melanoma and NSCLC xenografts. We observe higher ADORA1, lower \nATF3, and lower PD-L1 expression levels in tumor tissues from nonresponders \namong PD-1 mAb-treated NSCLC patients.",

The expression levels of p53 during Mtb infection were stronger in M1 \nmacrophages than in M2 macrophages. The TLR2/JNK signaling pathway plays an \nessential role in the modulation of M1 macrophage polarization upon Mtb \ninfection. It facilitates p53-mediated apoptosis through the production of \nreactive oxygen species, nitric oxide and inflammatory cytokines in Mtb-infected \nM1 macrophages. In addition, nutlin-3 effectively abrogated the intracellular \nsurvival of mycobacteria in both TB patients and healthy controls after H37Ra \ninfection for 24 h, indicating that the enhancement of p53 production \neffectively suppressed the intracellular survival of Mtb in hosts. These results \nsuggest that p53 can be a new therapeutic target for TB therapy.",

However, the \nmolecular mechanism remains unclear. Here we studied the role of mPGES-1/PGE2 \ncascade in activating Stat3 signaling and the contribution of Stat3 in PGE2- and \nAdr-induced podocyte apoptosis. In murine podocytes, PGE2 dose- and \ntime-dependently increased the phosphorylation of Stat3 in line with the \nenhanced cell apoptosis and reduced podocyte protein podocin. In agreement with \nthe increased Stat3 phosphorylation, Stat3-derived cytokines including IL-6, \nIL-17, MCP-1, and ICAM-1 were significantly upregulated following PGE2 \ntreatment. By application of a specific Stat3 inhibitor S3I-201, PGE2-induced \npodocyte apoptosis was largely abolished in parallel with a blockade of podocin \nreduction. Next, we observed that Adr treatment also enhanced p-Stat3 and \nactivated mPGES-1/PGE2 cascade. Blockade of Stat3 by S3I-201 significantly \nameliorated Adr-induced cell apoptosis and podocin reduction. More \ninterestingly, silencing mPGES-1 in podocytes by mPGES-1 siRNA blocked \nAdr-induced increments of Stat-3 phosphorylation, PGE2 production, and \nStat3-derived inflammatory cytokines. Taken together, this study suggested that \nmPGES-1-derived PGE2 could activate Stat3 signaling to promote podocyte \napoptosis.

Here, we found that overexpression of human wild-type full-length MAPT, \nwhich models MAPT pathologies as seen in sporadic AD patients, induced autophagy \ndeficits via repression of autophagosome-lysosome fusion leading to \nsignificantly increased LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)-II \nand SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) protein levels with autophagosome accumulation. \nAt the molecular level, intracellular MAPT aggregation inhibited expression of \nIST1 (IST1 factor associated with ESCRT-III), a positive modulator for the \nformation of ESCRT (the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport) \ncomplex that is required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Upregulating IST1 in \nhuman MAPT transgenic mice attenuated autophagy deficit with reduced MAPT \naggregation and ameliorated synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions, while \ndownregulating IST1 per se induced autophagy deficit with impaired synapse and \ncognitive function in naïve mice. IST1 can facilitate association of CHMP2B \n(charged multivesicular body protein 2B) and CHMP4B/SNF7-2 to form ESCRT-III \ncomplex, while lack of IST1 impeded the complex formation. Finally, we \ndemonstrate that MAPT accumulation suppresses IST1 transcription with the \nmechanisms involving the ANP32A-regulated mask of histone acetylation. Our \nfindings suggest that the AD-like MAPT accumulation can repress \nautophagosome-lysosome fusion by deregulating ANP32A-INHAT-IST1-ESCRT-III \npathway, which also reveals a vicious cycle of MAPT accumulation and autophagy \ndeficit in the chronic course of AD neurodegeneration.",

            "TEXT": "YAP and AP-1 Cooperate to Initiate Pancreatic Cancer Development from Ductal \nCells in Mice.\n\nThe development of pancreatic cancer is heavily dependent upon the aberrant \nactivation of KRAS signaling. Among the downstream targets of KRAS, the \neffectors of the Hippo pathway YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) are crucial during cancer \ninitiation and progression. However, little is known about the cell \ntype-specific effects of YAP/TAZ on the development of pancreatic cancer. Here \nwe clarify the unique consequences of YAP/TAZ activation in the ductal cell \npopulation of the pancreas by generating mice with pancreatic duct \ncell-specific, inducible knockouts of Lats1 and Lats2, the main kinases upstream \nof YAP/TAZ. Oncogenic activation of YAP by deletion of Lats1/2 in ductal cells \nled to the rapid transformation of the pancreas, which was accompanied by a \nrobust increase in the expression of YAP and AP-1 target genes. Pharmacologic \ninhibition of AP-1 activity induced death in Lats1/2 knockout organoids and \nattenuated YAP-dependent transformation of the pancreas in vivo. Both YAP and \nAP-1 were activated during the development of KRAS-dependent cancer in mice and \nhuman patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting that this \nsignaling hub represents an important mediator of pancreatic cancer development \nand progression. Collectively, these data define a YAP-dependent mechanism of \npancreatic cancer cell development and suggest that inhibition of AP-1 can \nsuppress this development.",

            "TEXT": "NG25, a novel inhibitor of TAK1, suppresses KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer growth \nin vitro and in vivo.\n\nKRAS mutations are one of the most prevalent genetic alterations in colorectal \ncancer (CRC). Although directly targeting KRAS still is a challenge in \nanti-cancer therapies, alternatively inhibiting KRAS related signaling pathways \nhas been approached effectively. Here we firstly reported that MAP kinase, \ntransforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), commonly expressed in \nCRC cell lines and significantly associated with KRAS mutation status. \nInhibition of TAK1 by the small molecular inhibitor NG25 could inhibit CRC cells \nproliferation in vitro and in vivo, especially in KRAS-mutant cells. NG25 \ninduced caspase-dependent apoptosis in KRAS-mutant cells and in orthotopic CRC \nmouse models by regulating the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family and the \ninhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. Besides inhibiting molecules \ndownstream of MAPK, including ERK, JNK and p38 phosphorylation, NG25 could block \nNF-κB activation in KRAS-mutant cells. As a target gene of NF-κB, down-regulated \nXIAP expression may be not only involved in apoptosis induced by NG25, but also \nreducing the formation of TAK1-XIAP complex that can activate TAK1 downstream \nsignaling pathways, which forms a positive feedback loop to further induce \napoptosis in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. Together, these findings indicated that TAK1 \nis an important kinase for survival of CRCs harboring KRAS mutations, and that \nNG25 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for KRAS-mutant CRC.",

In AML cells, NPM1 mutations result in abnormal cytoplasmic \nlocalization of the mutant protein (NPM1c); however, it is unknown whether NPM1c \nis required to maintain the leukemic state. Here, we show that loss of NPM1c \nfrom the cytoplasm, either through nuclear relocalization or targeted \ndegradation, results in immediate downregulation of homeobox (HOX) genes \nfollowed by differentiation.

We describe an exquisite dependency of \nNPM1-mutant AML cells on NPM1c, providing the rationale for the use of nuclear \nexport inhibitors in AML with mutated NPM1.",

DEPTOR expression has been shown to be \ndiversely controlled at transcriptional levels in cell- and context-specific \nmanners. However, whether there is a general mechanism for the regulation of \nDEPTOR expression remains largely unknown. Here, we report that DEPTOR is a \ndownstream target of the tumor suppressor, p53, whose activity is positively \ncorrelated with DEPTOR expression both in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo in \nmouse tissues. Mechanistically, p53 directly binds to the DEPTOR promoter and \ntransactivates its expression. Depletion of the p53-binding site on the DEPTOR \npromoter by CRISPR-Cas9 technology decreases DEPTOR expression and promotes cell \nproliferation and survival by activating AKT signaling. Importantly, inhibition \nof AKT by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown abrogates the \ninduction of cell growth and survival induced by deletion of the p53-binding \nregion on the DEPTOR promoter. Furthermore, p53, upon activation by the \ngenotoxic agent doxorubicin, induces DEPTOR expression, leading to cancer cell \nresistance to doxorubicin. Together, DEPTOR is a direct p53 downstream target \nand contributes to p53-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, survival, and \nchemosensitivity.",

We have previously demonstrated \nthat certain miRNAs play a crucial role in the innate immune responses of human \noral epithelial cells to Porphyromonas gingivalis. While addressing the \nmechanisms of P. gingivalis induced apoptosis in these cells, we discovered that \ncertain miRNAs are upregulated upon stimulation with live bacteria. These \nupregulated miRNAs include hsa-miR-584, hsa-miR-572, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-492, \nhsa-miR-623 and hsa-miR-663. Further analysis revealed an unexpected role for \nhsa-miR-663 (miR-663). To further evaluate miR-663 function, we overexpressed \nmiR-663 in epithelial cells which resulted in cellular apoptosis. The \nbioinformatics analysis of the miR-663 target prediction, revealed a strong \nbinding affinity to a 3' UTR region of Apoptosis Antagonizing Transcription \nFactor (AATF) mRNA. To demonstrate the binding of miR-663 to AATF mRNA, the \nputative miR-663 target site within the 3'-UTR region of AATF was cloned in \nluciferase vector and transfected to HEK293T cells. Luminescence data showed the \ndownregulation of luciferase activity in cells that had the full length target \nregion of the putative binding site, confirming that AATF is one of the targets \nfor miR-663. This prompted us to further evaluate its role in a cancer cell line \n(MCF-7) to determine miR-663s' apoptotic function. The overexpression of miR-663 \nled to a significant increase in apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, \nmiR-663 may function as an 'apoptomiR' by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic gene \nAATF to induce apoptosis. These findings could have therapeutic implications for \nepithelial cell targeting in cancer therapy.",

            "TEXT": "Accumulation of tissue factor in endothelial cells promotes cellular apoptosis \nthrough over-activation of Src1 and involves β1-integrin signalling.\n\nAccumulation of tissue factor (TF) within cells leads to cellular apoptosis \nmediated through p38 and p53 pathways. In this study, the involvement of Src1 in \nthe induction of TF-mediated cell apoptosis, and the mechanisms of Src1 \nactivation were investigated. Human coronary artery endothelial cell (HCAEC) \nwere transfected with plasmids to express the wild-type TF (TFWt-tGFP), or a \nmutant (Ser253 → Ala) which is incapable of being released from cells \n(TFAla253-tGFP). The cells were then activated with PAR2-agonist peptide \n(SLIGKV-NH) and the phosphorylation of Src and Rac, and also the kinase activity \nof Src were assessed. Transfected cells were also pre-incubated with pp60c Src \ninhibitor, FAK inhibitor-14, or a blocking anti-β1-integrin antibody prior to \nactivation and the phosphorylation of p38 as well as cellular apoptosis was \nexamined. Finally, cells were co-transfected with the plasmids, together with a \nSrc1-specific siRNA, activated as above and the cellular apoptosis measured. \nActivation of PAR2 lead to the phosphorylation of Src1 and Rac1 proteins at \n60 min regardless of TF expression. Moreover, Src phosphorylation and kinase \nactivity was prolonged up to 100 min in the presence of TF, with a significantly \nhigher magnitude when the non-releasable TFAla253-tGFP was expressed in HCAEC. \nInhibition of Src with pp60c, or suppression of Src1 expression in cells, \nreduced p38 phosphorylation and prevented cellular apoptosis. In contrast, \ninhibition of FAK had no significant influence on Src kinase activity or \ncellular apoptosis. Finally, pre-incubation of cells with an inhibitory \nanti-β1-integrin antibody reduced both Src1 activation and cellular apoptosis. \nOur data show for the first time that the over-activation of Src1 is a mediator \nof TF-induced cellular apoptosis in endothelial cells through a mechanism that \nis dependent on its interaction with β1-integrin.",

            "TEXT": "EZH2-Mediated Downregulation of the Tumor Suppressor DAB2IP Maintains Ovarian \nCancer Stem Cells.\n\nThe majority of women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer eventually \ndevelop recurrence, which rapidly evolves into chemoresistant disease. \nPersistence of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) at the end of therapy may be \nresponsible for emergence of resistant tumors. In this study, we demonstrate \nthat in OCSC, the tumor suppressor disabled homolog 2-interacting protein \n(DAB2IP) is silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation of the DAB2IP \npromoter. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of DAB2IP in epithelial ovarian cancer \ncell lines upregulated expression of stemness-related genes and induced \nconversion of non-CSC to CSC, while enforced expression of DAB2IP suppressed CSC \nproperties. Transcriptomic analysis showed that overexpression of DAB2IP in \novarian cancer significantly altered stemness-associated genes and bioinformatic \nanalysis revealed WNT signaling as a dominant pathway mediating the CSC \ninhibitory effect of DAB2IP. Specifically, DAB2IP inhibited WNT signaling via \ndownregulation of WNT5B, an important stemness inducer. Reverse phase protein \narray further demonstrated activation of noncanonical WNT signaling via C-JUN as \na downstream target of WNT5B, which was blocked by inhibiting RAC1, a prominent \nregulator of C-JUN activation. Coadministration of EZH2 inhibitor GSK126 and \nRAC1 inhibitor NSC23766 suppressed OCSC survival in vitro and inhibited tumor \ngrowth and increased platinum sensitivity in vivo. Overall, these data establish \nthat DAB2IP suppresses the cancer stem cell phenotype via inhibition of \nWNT5B-induced activation of C-JUN and can be epigenetically silenced by EZH2 in \nOCSC. Targeting the EZH2/DAB2IP/C-JUN axis therefore presents a promising \nstrategy to prevent ovarian cancer recurrence and has potential for clinical \ntranslation.",

Modulation of ferroptosis may have therapeutic \npotential since it has been implicated in various human diseases as well as \npotential antitumor activities. However, much remains unknown about the \nunderlying mechanisms and genetic determinants of ferroptosis. Given the \ncritical role of kinases in most biological processes and the availability of \nvarious kinase inhibitors, we sought to systemically identify kinases essential \nfor ferroptosis. We performed a forward genetic-based kinome screen against \nferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells triggered by cystine deprivation. This screen \nidentified 34 essential kinases involved in TNFα and NF-kB signaling. \nUnexpectedly, the DNA damage response serine/threonine kinase ATM (mutated in \nAtaxia-Telangiectasia) was found to be essential for ferroptosis. The \npharmacological or genetic inhibition of ATM consistently rescued multiple \ncancer cells from ferroptosis triggered by cystine deprivation or erastin. \nInstead of the canonical DNA damage pathways, ATM inhibition rescued ferroptosis \nby increasing the expression of iron regulators involved in iron storage \n(ferritin heavy and light chain, FTH1 and FTL) and export (ferroportin, FPN1). \nThe coordinated changes of these iron regulators during ATM inhibition resulted \nin a lowering of labile iron and prevented the iron-dependent ferroptosis. \nFurthermore, we found that ATM inhibition enhanced the nuclear translocation of \nmetal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1), responsible for regulating \nexpression of Ferritin/FPN1 and ferroptosis protection. Genetic depletion of \nMTF-1 abolished the regulation of iron-regulatory elements by ATM and \nresensitized the cells to ferroptosis. Together, we have identified an \nunexpected ATM-MTF1-Ferritin/FPN1 regulatory axis as novel determinants of \nferroptosis through regulating labile iron levels.",

            "TEXT": "Mesenchymal stem cells reverse EMT process through blocking the activation of \nNF-κB and Hedgehog pathways in LPS-induced acute lung injury.\n\nAcute lung injury (ALI) is a pulmonary disorder, which can result in fibrosis of \nthe lung tissues. Recently, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has become a novel \ntherapeutic method for ALI. However, the potential mechanism by which MSC \nregulates the progression of ALI remains blurry. The present study focused on \ninvestigating the mechanism underneath MSC-reversed lung injury and fibrosis. At \nfirst, we determined that coculture with MSC led to the inactivation of NF-κB \nsignaling and therefore suppressed hedgehog pathway in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells. \nBesides, we confirmed that MSC-exosomes were responsible for the inhibition of \nEMT process in LPS-treated MLE-12 cells through transmitting miRNAs. Mechanism \ninvestigation revealed that MSC-exosome transmitted miR-182-5p and miR-23a-3p \ninto LPS-treated MLE-12 cells to, respectively, target Ikbkb and Usp5. Of note, \nUsp5 interacted with IKKβ to hamper IKKβ ubiquitination. Moreover, co-inhibition \nof miR-182-5p and miR-23a-3p offset the suppression of MSC on EMT process in \nLPS-treated MLE-12 cells as well as in LPS-injured lungs of mice. Besides, the \nretarding effect of MSC on p65 nuclear translocation was also counteracted after \nco-inhibiting miR-182-5p and miR-23a-3p, both in vitro and in vivo. In summary, \nMSC-exosome transmitted miR-23a-3p and miR-182-5p reversed the progression of \nLPS-induced lung injury and fibrosis through inhibiting NF-κB and hedgehog \npathways via silencing Ikbkb and destabilizing IKKβ.",

            "TEXT": "LncRNA LINC00998 inhibits the malignant glioma phenotype via the CBX3-mediated \nc-Met/Akt/mTOR axis.\n\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), once considered to be nonfunctional relics of \nevolution, are emerging as essential genes in tumor progression. However, the \nfunction and underlying mechanisms of lncRNAs in glioma remain unclear. This \nstudy aimed to investigate the role of LINC00998 in glioma progression. Through \nscreening using TCGA database, we found that LINC00998 was downregulated in \nglioblastoma tissues and that low expression of LINC00998 was associated with \npoor prognosis. Overexpression of LINC00998 inhibited glioma cell proliferation \nin vitro and in vivo and blocked the G1/S cell cycle transition, which exerted a \ntumor-suppressive effect on glioma progression. Mechanistically, RNA pull-down \nand mass spectrometry results showed an interaction between LINC00998 and CBX3. \nIP assays demonstrated that LINC00998 could stabilize CBX3 and prevent its \nubiquitination degradation. GSEA indicated that LINC00998 could regulate the \nc-Met/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which was further confirmed by a rescue assay \nusing siRNA-mediated knockdown of CBX3 and the Akt inhibitor MK2206. In \naddition, dual-luciferase assays showed that miR-34c-5p could directly bind to \nLINC00998 and downregulate its expression. Our results identified LINC00998 as a \nnovel tumor suppressor in glioma, and LINC00998 could be a novel prognostic \nbiomarker, providing a strategy for precision therapy in glioma patients.",

A newly reported circular RNA \nHIPK3 (circHIPK3) is critical in cell proliferation of various cancer types, \nalthough its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has yet to be \nelucidated. Our results provided evidence that silencing of circHIPK3 \nsignificantly impaired cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induced \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Mechanistically, we uncovered that autophagy was \ninduced upon loss of circHIPK3 via the MIR124-3p-STAT3-PRKAA/AMPKa axis in STK11 \nmutant lung cancer cell lines (A549 and H838). STAT3 abrogation as well as \ntransfection with a MIR124-3p mimic, recapitulated the induction of autophagy. \nWe also demonstrated antagonistic regulation on autophagy between circHIPK3 and \nlinear HIPK3 (linHIPK3). We therefore propose that the ratio between circHIPK3 \nand linHIPK3 (C:L ratio) may reflect autophagy levels in cancer cells. We \nobserved that a high C:L ratio (>0.49) was an indicator of poor survival, \nespecially in advanced-stage NSCLC patients. These results support that \ncircHIPK3 is a key autophagy regulator in a subset of lung cancer and has \npotential clinical use as a prognostic factor. The circular RNA HIPK3 \n(circHIPK3) functions as an oncogene and autophagy regulator may potential use \nas a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in lung cancer.",

            "TEXT": "SIRT3 promotes antimycobacterial defenses by coordinating mitochondrial and \nautophagic functions.\n\nSIRT3 (sirtuin 3), a mitochondrial protein deacetylase, maintains respiratory \nfunction, but its role in the regulation of innate immune defense is largely \nunknown. Herein, we show that SIRT3 coordinates mitochondrial function and \nmacroautophagy/autophagy activation to promote anti-mycobacterial responses \nthrough PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha). SIRT3 \ndeficiency enhanced inflammatory responses and mitochondrial dysfunction, \nleading to defective host defense and pathological inflammation during \nmycobacterial infection. Antibody-mediated depletion of polymorphonuclear \nneutrophils significantly increased protection against mycobacterial infection \nin sirt3-/- mice. In addition, mitochondrial oxidative stress promoted excessive \ninflammation induced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in sirt3-/- \nmacrophages. Notably, SIRT3 was essential for the enhancement of PPARA, a key \nregulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and autophagy activation in the context \nof infection. Importantly, overexpression of either PPARA or TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB) in sirt3-/- macrophages recovered antimicrobial activity through \nautophagy activation. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of SIRT3 enhanced \nantibacterial autophagy and functional mitochondrial pools during mycobacterial \ninfection. Finally, the levels of SIRT3 and PPARA were downregulated and \ninversely correlated with TNF (tumor necrosis factor) levels in peripheral blood \nmononuclear cells from tuberculosis patients. Collectively, these data \ndemonstrate a previously unappreciated function of SIRT3 in orchestrating \nmitochondrial and autophagic functions to promote antimycobacterial responses.",

Increasing studies have found that TMZ treatment \ncould induce autophagy that may link to therapeutic resistance in GBM, but, the \nprecise mechanisms are not fully understood. Understanding the molecular \nmechanisms underlying the response of GBM to chemotherapy is paramount for \ndeveloping improved cancer therapeutics. In this study, we demonstrated that the \nloss of DOC-2/DAB2 interacting protein (DAB2IP) is responsible for \nTMZ-resistance in GBM through ATG9B. DAB2IP sensitized GBM to TMZ and suppressed \nTMZ-induced autophagy by negatively regulating ATG9B expression. A higher level \nof ATG9B expression was associated with GBM compared to low-grade glioma. The \nknockdown of ATG9B expression in GBM cells suppressed TMZ-induced autophagy as \nwell as TMZ-resistance. Furthermore, we showed that DAB2IP negatively regulated \nATG9B expression by blocking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. To enhance the benefit \nof TMZ and avoid therapeutic resistance, effective combination strategies were \ntested using a small molecule inhibitor blocking the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in \naddition to TMZ. The combination treatment synergistically enhanced the efficacy \nof TMZ in GBM cells. In conclusion, the present study identified the mechanisms \nof TMZ-resistance of GBM mediated by DAB2IP and ATG9B which provides insight \ninto a potential strategy to overcome TMZ chemo-resistance.",

Nevertheless, the influence of hypoxia on TICs is \npoorly understood. Using previously established, TIC-enrichedpatient-derived \ncolorectal cancer (CRC) cultures, we show that hypoxia increases the \nself-renewal capacity of TICs while inducing proliferation arrest in their more \ndifferentiated counterpart cultures. Gene expression data revealed \nmacroautophagy/autophagy as one of the major pathways induced by hypoxia in \nTICs. Interestingly, hypoxia-induced autophagy was found to induce \nphosphorylation of EZR (ezrin) at Thr567 residue, which could be reversed by \nknocking down ATG5, BNIP3, BNIP3L, or BECN1. Furthermore, we identified \nPRKCA/PKCα as a potential kinase involved in hypoxia-induced autophagy-mediated \nTIC self-renewal. Genetic targeting of autophagy or pharmacological inhibition \nof PRKC/PKC and EZR resulted in decreased tumor-initiating potential of TICs. In \naddition, we observed significantly reduced in vivo tumor initiation and growth \nafter a stable knockdown of ATG5. Analysis of human CRC samples showed that \np-EZR is often present in TICs located in the hypoxic and autophagic regions of \nthe tumor. Altogether, our results establish the hypoxia-autophagy-PKC-EZR \nsignaling axis as a novel regulatory mechanism of TIC self-renewal and CRC \nprogression. Autophagy inhibition might thus represent a promising therapeutic \nstrategy for cancer patients.",

            "TEXT": "Senescence Reprogramming by TIMP1 Deficiency Promotes Prostate Cancer \nMetastasis.\n\nMetastases account for most cancer-related deaths, yet the mechanisms underlying \nmetastatic spread remain poorly understood. Recent evidence demonstrates that \nsenescent cells, while initially restricting tumorigenesis, can induce tumor \nprogression. Here, we identify the metalloproteinase inhibitor TIMP1 as a \nmolecular switch that determines the effects of senescence in prostate cancer. \nSenescence driven either by PTEN deficiency or chemotherapy limits the \nprogression of prostate cancer in mice. TIMP1 deletion allows senescence to \npromote metastasis, and elimination of senescent cells with a senolytic BCL-2 \ninhibitor impairs metastasis. Mechanistically, TIMP1 loss reprograms the \nsenescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of senescent tumor cells \nthrough activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Loss of PTEN and TIMP1 \nin prostate cancer is frequent and correlates with resistance to docetaxel and \nworst clinical outcomes in patients treated in an adjuvant setting. Altogether, \nthese findings provide insights into the dual roles of tumor-associated \nsenescence and can potentially impact the treatment of prostate cancer.",

Here we show that carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1C \n(CPT1C), an enzyme that catalyzes carnitinylation of fatty acids for transport \ninto mitochondria for β-oxidation, plays a major role in the regulation of \ncancer cell senescence through mitochondria-associated metabolic reprograming. \nMetabolomics analysis suggested alterations in mitochondria activity, as \nrevealed by the marked decrease in acylcarnitines in senescent human pancreatic \ncarcinoma PANC-1 cells, indicating low CPT1C activity. Direct analyses of mRNA \nand protein show that CPT1C is significantly reduced in senescent cells. \nFurthermore, abnormal mitochondrial function was observed in senescent PANC-1 \ncells, leading to lower cell survival under metabolic stress and suppressed \ntumorigenesis in a mouse xenograft model. Knock-down of CPT1C in PANC-1 cells \ninduced mitochondrial dysfunction, caused senescence-like growth suppression and \ncellular senescence, suppressed cell survival under metabolic stress, and \ninhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Further, CPT1C knock-down suppressed xenograft \ntumor growth in situ. Silencing of CPT1C in five other tumor cell lines also \ncaused cellular senescence. On the contrary, gain-of-function of CPT1C reversed \nPANC-1 cell senescence and enhanced mitochondrial function. This study \nidentifies CPT1C as a novel biomarker and key regulator of cancer cell \nsenescence through mitochondria-associated metabolic reprograming, and suggests \nthat inhibition of CPT1C may represent a new therapeutic strategy for cancer \ntreatment through induction of tumor senescence.",

We demonstrate that IL6/STAT3 \nsignaling drives metastasis in ER+ breast cancer independent of ER. STAT3 \nhijacks a subset of ER enhancers to drive a distinct transcriptional program. \nAlthough these enhancers are shared by both STAT3 and ER, IL6/STAT3 activity is \nrefractory to standard ER-targeted therapies. Instead, inhibition of STAT3 \nactivity using the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib decreases breast cancer invasion \nin vivo. Therefore, IL6/STAT3 and ER oncogenic pathways are functionally \ndecoupled, highlighting the potential of IL6/STAT3-targeted therapies in ER+ \nbreast cancer.",

CD9 is upregulated in senescent endothelial cells, \nneointima hyperplasia, and atherosclerotic plaques. However, its role in \ncellular senescence and atherosclerosis remains undefined. We investigated the \npotential mechanism for CD9-mediated cellular senescence and its role in \natherosclerotic plaque formation. CD9 knockdown in senescent human umbilical \nvein endothelial cells significantly rescued senescence phenotypes, while CD9 \nupregulation in young cells accelerated senescence. CD9 regulated cellular \nsenescence through a phosphatidylinositide 3 kinase-AKT-mTOR-p53 signal pathway. \nCD9 expression increased in arterial tissues from humans and rats with age, and \nin atherosclerotic plaques in humans and mice. Anti-mouse CD9 antibody \nnoticeably prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice \nand Ldlr-/- mice. Furthermore, CD9 ablation in ApoE-/- mice decreased \natherosclerotic lesions in aorta and aortic sinus. These results suggest that \nCD9 plays critical roles in endothelial cell senescence and consequently the \npathogenesis of atherosclerosis, implying that CD9 is a novel target for \nprevention and treatment of vascular aging and atherosclerosis.",

            "TEXT": "Tumor Fibroblast-Derived FGF2 Regulates Expression of SPRY1 in Esophageal \nTumor-Infiltrating T Cells and Plays a Role in T-cell Exhaustion.\n\nT-cell exhaustion was initially identified in chronic infection in mice and was \nsubsequently described in humans with cancer. Although the distinct signature of \nexhausted T (TEX) cells in cancer has been well investigated, the molecular \nmechanism of T-cell exhaustion in cancer is not fully understood. Using \nsingle-cell RNA sequencing, we report here that TEX cells in esophageal cancer \nare more heterogeneous than previously clarified. Sprouty RTK signaling \nantagonist 1 (SPRY1) was notably enriched in two subsets of exhausted CD8+ T \ncells. When overexpressed, SPRY1 impaired T-cell activation by interacting with \nCBL, a negative regulator of ZAP-70 tyrosine phosphorylation. Data from the \nTumor Immune Estimation Resource revealed a strong correlation between FGF2 and \nSPRY1 expression in esophageal cancer. High expression of FGF2 was evident in \nfibroblasts from esophageal cancer tissue and correlated with poor overall \nsurvival. In vitro administration of FGF2 significantly upregulated expression \nof SPRY1 in CD8+ T cells and attenuated T-cell receptor-triggered CD8+ T-cell \nactivation. A mouse tumor model confirmed that overexpression of FGF2 in \nfibroblasts significantly upregulated SPRY1 expression in TEX cells, impaired \nT-cell cytotoxic activity, and promoted tumor growth. Thus, these findings \nidentify FGF2 as an important regulator of SPRY1 expression involved in \nestablishing the dysfunctional state of CD8+ T cells in esophageal cancer.",

            "TEXT": "PRKN-regulated mitophagy and cellular senescence during COPD pathogenesis.\n\nCigarette smoke (CS)-induced accumulation of mitochondrial damage has been \nwidely implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis. \nMitophagy plays a crucial role in eliminating damaged mitochondria, and is \ngoverned by the PINK1 (PTEN induced putative protein kinase 1)-PRKN (parkin RBR \nE3 ubiquitin protein ligase) pathway. Although both increased PINK1 and reduced \nPRKN have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis in association with mitophagy, \nthere are conflicting reports for the role of mitophagy in COPD progression. To \nclarify the involvement of PRKN-regulated mitophagy in COPD pathogenesis, prkn \nknockout (KO) mouse models were used. To illuminate how PINK1 and PRKN regulate \nmitophagy in relation to CS-induced mitochondrial damage and cellular \nsenescence, overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in airway \nepithelial cells (AEC). In comparison to wild-type mice, prkn KO mice \ndemonstrated enhanced airway wall thickening with emphysematous changes \nfollowing CS exposure. AEC in CS-exposed prkn KO mice showed accumulation of \ndamaged mitochondria and increased oxidative modifications accompanied by \naccelerated cellular senescence. In vitro experiments showed PRKN overexpression \nwas sufficient to induce mitophagy during CSE exposure even in the setting of \nreduced PINK1 protein levels, resulting in attenuation of mitochondrial ROS \nproduction and cellular senescence. Conversely PINK1 overexpression failed to \nrecover impaired mitophagy caused by PRKN knockdown, indicating that PRKN \nprotein levels can be the rate-limiting factor in PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy \nduring CSE exposure. These results suggest that PRKN levels may play a pivotal \nrole in COPD pathogenesis by regulating mitophagy, suggesting that PRKN \ninduction could mitigate the progression of COPD.",

            "TEXT": "Epigenetic Inactivation of α-Internexin Accelerates Microtubule Polymerization \nin Colorectal Cancer.\n\nDNA methylation contributes to malignant transformation, but little is known \nabout how the methylation drives colorectal cancer evolution at the early \nstages. Here we identify aberrant INA (α-internexin) gene methylation in colon \nadenoma and adenocarcinoma by filtering data obtained from a genome-wide screen \nof methylated genes. The gene encoding INA, a type IV intermediate filament, was \nfrequently hypermethylated in CpG islands located in the promoter region. This \nhypermethylation preferentially occurred in large tumors and was a prognostic \nmarker for poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer. This type \nof epigenetic alteration silenced INA expression in both adenoma and \nadenocarcinoma tissues. Gene silencing of INA in colorectal cancer cells \nincreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Restored INA expression \nblocked migration and invasion in vitro and reduced lung metastasis in vivo. \nMechanistically, INA directly inhibited microtubule polymerization in vitro and \ndecreased intracellular microtubule plus-end assembly rates. A peptide array \nscreen surveying the tubulin-binding sites in INA identified a tubulin-binding \nmotif located in the N-terminal head domain that plays a tumor-suppressive role \nby binding to unpolymerized tubulins and impeding microtubule polymerization. \nThus, epigenetic inactivation of INA is an intermediate filament reorganization \nevent that is essential to accelerate microtubule polymerization in the early \nstages of colorectal cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides insight into the \nepigenetic inactivation of INA, a novel identified tumor suppressor, which \nincreases microtubule polymerization during colorectal cancer progression.",

Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is \nthe master transcription factor regulating lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. \nUnder external stimuli such as starvation, dephosphorylated TFEB transports into \nthe nucleus to specifically recognize and bind to the coordinated lysosomal \nexpression and regulation (CLEAR) elements at the promotors of autophagy and \nlysosomal biogenesis-related genes. The function of TFEB in the nucleus is fine \nregulated but the molecular mechanism is not fully elucidated. In this study, we \ndiscovered that miR-30b-5p, a small RNA which is known to regulate a series of \ngenes through posttranscriptional regulation in the cytoplasm, was translocated \ninto the nucleus, bound to the CLEAR elements, suppressed the transcription of \nTFEB-dependent downstream genes, and further inhibited the lysosomal biogenesis \nand the autophagic flux; meanwhile, knocking out the endogenous miR-30b-5p by \nCRISPR/Cas9 technique significantly increased the TFEB-mediated transactivation, \nresulting in the increased expression of autophagy and lysosomal \nbiogenesis-related genes. Overexpressing miR-30b-5p in mice livers showed a \ndecrease in lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy. These in vitro and in vivo data \nindicate that miR-30b-5p may inhibit the TFEB-dependent transactivation by \nbinding to the CLEAR elements in the nucleus to regulate the lysosomal \nbiogenesis and autophagy.

In this study, after screening the CNOT3 mRNA in a cancer microarray \ndatabase called Oncomine and examining the expression levels of CNOT3 mRNA in \nnormal tissues and lung cancer tissues, we found that CNOT3 was up-regulated in \nlung cancer tissues. Besides, its high-expression was associated with poor \nprognosis of lung cancer patients. We also found higher expression level of \nCNOT3 and lower expression level of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 \n(RIPK3) in cisplatin-resistant A549 (A549/DDP) cells, and knocking down CNOT3 \nexpression could sensitize A549/DDP cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We \ndemonstrated that CNOT3 depletion up-regulated the expression level of RIPK3 and \nthe enhanced apoptosis was mediated by the elevated RIPK3 to further trigger \nCaspase 8 activation.

GDC-0349 is a \npotent and selective ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor. In A549 cells and primary \nhuman NSCLC cells, GDC-0349 inhibited cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle \nprogression, migration and invasion, while inducing significant apoptosis \nactivation. Although GDC-0349 blocked Akt-mTORC1/2 activation in NSCLC cells, it \nalso exerted cytotoxicity in Akt1-knockout A549 cells. Furthermore, restoring \nAkt-mTOR activation by a constitutively-active Akt1 only partially attenuated \nGDC-0349-induced A549 cell apoptosis, indicating the existence of \nAkt-mTOR-independent mechanisms. In NSCLC cells GDC-0349 induced sphingosine \nkinase 1 (SphK1) inhibition, ceramide accumulation, JNK activation and oxidative \ninjury. Conversely, N-acetylcysteine, the JNK inhibitor and sphingosine \n1-phosphate alleviated GDC-0349-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis. In vivo, daily \noral administration of GDC-0349 potently inhibited NSCLC xenograft growth in \nmice. Akt-mTOR in-activation, SphK1 inhibition, JNK activation and oxidative \nstress were detected in NSCLC xenograft tissues with GDC-0349 administration. In \nsummary, GDC-0349 inhibits NSCLC cell growth via Akt-mTOR-dependent and \nAkt-mTOR-independent mechanisms.",

The presence of LPS in pancreatic tissue from mice and \nfrom patients and healthy controls was determined using immunohistochemistry, \nimmunoblots, and chromogenic assay. Mice lacking pancreatic autophagy exhibited \nlocal signs of inflammation and were particularly sensitive to the toxic effect \nof LPS injection as compared to control mice. In response to LPS, Atg7Δpan mice \nexhibited enhanced vacuolization of pancreatic acinar cells, increase in TLR4 \nexpression coupled to enhanced expression of NF-κΒ, JNK, and pro-inflammatory \ncytokines by acinar cells and enhanced infiltration by myeloid cells (but not \nAtg7F/F controls). Cell death was enhanced in Atg7Δpan pancreata, but only \nnecroptosis and trypsin activation was further amplified following LPS injection \nalong with elevated pancreatic LPS. The presence of LPS was identified in the \npancreata from all 14 CP patients examined but was absent in the pancreata from \nall 10 normal controls. Altogether, these results support a potential role for \nmetabolic endotoxemia in the pathogenesis of CP.

            "TEXT": "The long noncoding RNA LUCAT1 promotes colorectal cancer cell proliferation by \nantagonizing Nucleolin to regulate MYC expression.\n\nThe long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LUCAT1 was recently reported to be upregulated \nand to play an essential role in multiple cancer types, especially colorectal \ncancer (CRC), but the molecular mechanisms of LUCAT1 in CRC are mostly \nunreported. Here, a systematic analysis of LUACT1 expression is performed with \ndata from TCGA database and clinic CRC samples. LUCAT1 is identified as a \nputative oncogene, which is significantly upregulated in CRC and is associated \nwith poor prognosis. Loss of LUCAT1 restricts CRC proliferative capacities in \nvitro and in vivo. Mechanically, NCL is identified as the protein binding \npartner of LUCAT1 by using chromatin isolation by RNA purification coupled with \nmass spectrometry (ChIRP-MS) and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. We also show \nthat NCL directly binds to LUCAT1 via its putative G-quadruplex-forming regions \nfrom nucleotides 717 to 746. The interaction between LUCAT1 and NCL interferes \nNCL-mediated inhibition of MYC and promote the expression of MYC. Cells lacking \nLUCAT1 show a decreased MYC expression, and NCL knockdown rescue LUCAT1 \ndepletion-induced inhibition of CRC cell proliferation and MYC expression. Our \nresults suggest that LUCAT1 plays a critical role in CRC cell proliferation by \ninhibiting the function of NCL via its G-quadruplex structure and may serve as a \nnew prognostic biomarker and effective therapeutic target for CRC.",

            "TEXT": "RIP1 kinase activity promotes steatohepatitis through mediating cell death and \ninflammation in macrophages.\n\nHepatocyte cell death and liver inflammation have been well recognized as \ncentral characteristics of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), however, the \nunderlying molecular basis remains elusive. The kinase receptor-interacting \nprotein 1 (RIP1) is a multitasking molecule with distinct functions in \nregulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation. Dissecting the role of RIP1 \ndistinct functions in different pathophysiology has absorbed huge research \nenthusiasm. Wild-type and RIP1 kinase-dead (Rip1K45A/K45A) mice were fed with \nhigh-fat diet (HFD) to investigate the role of RIP1 kinase activity in the \npathogenesis of NASH. Rip1K45A/K45A mice exhibited significantly alleviated NASH \nphenotype of hepatic steatosis, liver damage, fibrosis as well as reduced \nhepatic cell death and inflammation compared to WT mice. Our results also \nindicated that both in vivo lipotoxicity and in vitro saturated fatty acids \n(palmitic acid) treatment were able to induce the kinase activation of RIP1 in \nliver macrophages. RIP1 kinase was required for mediating inflammasome \nactivation, apoptotic and necrotic cell death induced by palmitic acid in both \nbone marrow-derived macrophage and mouse primary Kupffer cells. Results from \nchimeric mice established through lethal irradiation and bone marrow \ntransplantation further confirmed that the RIP1 kinase in hematopoietic-derived \nmacrophages contributed mostly to the disease progression in NASH. Consistent \nwith murine models, we also found that RIP1 kinase was markedly activated in \nhuman NASH, and the kinase activation mainly occurred in liver macrophages as \nindicated by immunofluorescence double staining. In summary, our study indicated \nthat RIP1 kinase was phosphorylated and activated mainly in liver macrophages in \nboth experimental and clinical NASH. We provided direct genetic evidence that \nthe kinase activity of RIP1 especially in hematopoietic-derived macrophages \ncontributes to the pathogenesis of NASH, through mediating inflammasome \nactivation and cell death induction. Macrophage RIP1 kinase represents a \nspecific and potential therapeutic target for NASH.",

            "TEXT": "ATP induces caspase-3/gasdermin E-mediated pyroptosis in NLRP3 pathway-blocked \nmurine macrophages.\n\nATP acts as a canonical activator to induce NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, \npyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation in macrophages, leading to \ncaspase-1/gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. It remains unclear whether \nATP can induce pyroptosis in macrophages when the NLRP3 pathway is blocked by \npathogenic infection. In this study, we used cellular models to mimic such \nblockade of NLRP3 activation: bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) treated \nwith NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950 and RAW264.7 cells deficient in ASC \n(apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment \ndomain) expression. The results showed that ATP treatment induced lytic cell \ndeath morphologically resembling canonical pyroptosis in both MCC950-treated \nBMDMs and RAW264.7 cells, but did not cause the activation of caspase-1 (by \ndetecting caspase-1p10 and mature interleukin-1β) and cleavage of GSDMD. \nInstead, both apoptotic initiator (caspase-8 and -9) and executioner (caspase-3 \nand -7) caspases were evidently activated and gasdermin E (GSDME) was cleaved to \ngenerate its N-terminal fragment (GSDME-NT) which executes pyroptosis. The \nGSDME-NT production and lytic cell death induced by ATP were diminished by \ncaspase-3 inhibitor. In BMDMs without MCC950 treatment, ATP induced the \nformation of ASC specks which were co-localized with caspase-8; with MCC950 \ntreatment, however, ATP did not induced the formation of ASC specks. In RAW264.7 \ncells, knockdown of GSDME by small interfering RNA attenuated ATP-induced lytic \ncell death and HMGB1 release into culture supernatants. Collectively, our \nresults indicate that ATP induces pyroptosis in macrophages through the \ncaspase-3/GSDME axis when the canonical NLRP3 pathway is blocked, suggestive of \nan alternative mechanism for combating against pathogen evasion.",

Type I PRMTs and their substrates have \nbeen implicated in human cancers, suggesting inhibition of type I PRMTs may \noffer a therapeutic approach for oncology. The current report describes \nGSK3368715 (EPZ019997), a potent, reversible type I PRMT inhibitor with \nanti-tumor effects in human cancer models. Inhibition of PRMT5, the predominant \ntype II PRMT, produces synergistic cancer cell growth inhibition when combined \nwith GSK3368715. Interestingly, deletion of the methylthioadenosine \nphosphorylase gene (MTAP) results in accumulation of the metabolite \n2-methylthioadenosine, an endogenous inhibitor of PRMT5, and correlates with \nsensitivity to GSK3368715 in cell lines. These data provide rationale to explore \nMTAP status as a biomarker strategy for patient selection.",

Here we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 5 \n(PRMT5) as a new metastasis-promoting factor in laryngeal carcinoma, and explore \nits underlying mechanism of action in regulating laryngeal cancer progression. \nWe illustrated that PRMT5 expression was positively correlated with tumor \nstages, lymphatic metastasis, and unfavorable outcome. Functional assays \nrevealed that PRMT5 promoted laryngeal carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, \nand invasive capacity in vitro, as well as lymph-node metastasis in vivo. The \nectopic expression of PRMT5 induced EMT with downregulation of E-cadherin and \nupregulation of N-cadherin, snail, and MMP9. Mechanistic results revealed that \nthe metastatic effects could be attributed to PRMT5-mediated activation of Wnt \nsignaling, and Wnt4 is an important driver of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. \nWnt4 silencing could reverse PRMT5-induced cell proliferation, migration, and \ninvasion capacities. Furthermore, inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling \npathway abolished the effect of PRMT5-induced proliferation, whereas activation \nof the pathway enhanced the effect of PRMT5 overexpression on cell \nproliferation. These results demonstrated that the oncogenic role of PRMT5 could \nbe attributed to PRMT5/Wnt4 axis-mediated activation of the Wnt/β-catenin \nsignaling pathway. PRMT5 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a \ntherapeutic target for lymphatic metastasis of laryngeal carcinoma.",

            "TEXT": "Differential Regulation of Cancer Progression by CDK4/6 Plays a Central Role in \nDNA Replication and Repair Pathways.\n\nAlthough the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 play fundamental roles in \ncancer, the specific pathways and downstream targets by which they exert their \ntumorigenic effects remain elusive. In this study, we uncover distinct and novel \nfunctions for these kinases in regulating tumor formation and metastatic \ncolonization in various solid tumors, including those of the breast, prostate, \nand pancreas. Combining in vivo CRISPR-based CDK4 and CDK6 gene editing with \npharmacologic inhibition approaches in orthotopic transplantation and \npatient-derived xenograft preclinical models, we defined clear functions for \nCDK4 and CDK6 in facilitating tumor growth and progression in metastatic \ncancers. Transcriptomic profiling of CDK4/6 CRISPR knockouts in breast cancer \nrevealed these two kinases to regulate cancer progression through distinct \nmechanisms. CDK4 regulated prometastatic inflammatory cytokine signaling, \nwhereas CDK6 mainly controlled DNA replication and repair processes. Inhibition \nof CDK6 but not CDK4 resulted in defective DNA repair and increased DNA damage. \nMultiple CDK6 DNA replication/repair genes were not only associated with cancer \nsubtype, grades, and poor clinical outcomes, but also facilitated primary tumor \ngrowth and metastasis in vivo. CRISPR-based genomic deletion of CDK6 efficiently \nblocked tumor formation and progression in preestablished cell- and \npatient-derived xenograft preclinical models of breast cancer, providing a \npotential novel targeted therapy for these deadly tumors.",

Although there are many factors \nunderlying the differences in survival between these two tumor types, \nimmune-related differences in cell content are potentially important \ncontributors. In order to investigate the role of IDH mutations in immune \nresponse, we created a syngeneic pair mouse model for mutant IDH1 (muIDH1) and \nwtIDH1 gliomas and demonstrated that muIDH1 mice showed many molecular and \nclinical similarities to muIDH1 human gliomas, including a 100-fold higher \nconcentration of 2-hydroxygluratate (2-HG), longer survival time, and higher CpG \nmethylation compared with wtIDH1. Also, we showed that IDH1 mutations caused \ndown-regulation of leukocyte chemotaxis, resulting in repression of the \ntumor-associated immune system. Given that significant infiltration of immune \ncells such as macrophages, microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils is linked to \npoor prognosis in many cancer types, these reduced immune infiltrates in muIDH1 \nglioma tumors may contribute in part to the differences in aggressiveness of the \ntwo glioma types.",

            "TEXT": "IRE1α Disruption in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cooperates with Antiangiogenic \nTherapy by Reversing ER Stress Adaptation and Remodeling the Tumor \nMicroenvironment.\n\nCancer cells exploit the unfolded protein response (UPR) to mitigate endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) stress caused by cellular oncogene activation and a hostile tumor \nmicroenvironment (TME). The key UPR sensor IRE1α resides in the ER and deploys a \ncytoplasmic kinase-endoribonuclease module to activate the transcription factor \nXBP1s, which facilitates ER-mediated protein folding. Studies of triple-negative \nbreast cancer (TNBC)-a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal posttreatment \nprognosis-implicate XBP1s in promoting tumor vascularization and progression. \nHowever, it remains unknown whether IRE1α adapts the ER in TNBC cells and \nmodulates their TME, and whether IRE1α inhibition can enhance antiangiogenic \ntherapy-previously found to be ineffective in patients with TNBC. To gauge IRE1α \nfunction, we defined an XBP1s-dependent gene signature, which revealed \nsignificant IRE1α pathway activation in multiple solid cancers, including TNBC. \nIRE1α knockout in TNBC cells markedly reversed substantial ultrastructural \nexpansion of their ER upon growth in vivo. IRE1α disruption also led to \nsignificant remodeling of the cellular TME, increasing pericyte numbers while \ndecreasing cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. \nPharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition strongly attenuated growth of cell \nline-based and patient-derived TNBC xenografts in mice and synergized with \nanti-VEGFA treatment to cause tumor stasis or regression. Thus, TNBC cells \ncritically rely on IRE1α to adapt their ER to in vivo stress and to adjust the \nTME to facilitate malignant growth. TNBC reliance on IRE1α is an important \nvulnerability that can be uniquely exploited in combination with antiangiogenic \ntherapy as a promising new biologic approach to combat this lethal disease. \nSIGNIFICANCE: Pharmacologic IRE1α kinase inhibition reverses ultrastructural \ndistension of the ER, normalizes the tumor vasculature, and remodels the \ncellular TME, attenuating TNBC growth in mice.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying its progression remains \nunclear. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a central mechanism for \nprotein degradation and turnover. Accumulating evidence showed that more and \nmore deubiquitinases could serve as attractive anti-cancer target. The \nexpression of USP14 and UCH37 in esophagus squamous cell carcinoma tissues were \nexamined by immunohistochemistry and western blot assays. Effect of b-AP15, a \nUSP14 and UCH37 inhibitor, on ESCC cell growth was evaluated by cell viability \nassay. After cell lines being treated with b-AP15, cell cycle, apoptosis and the \nexpression of related proteins were further explored to investigate the \nanti-ESCC mechanism of b-AP15. Results showed that deubiquitinating enzymes \n(DUBs) USP14 and UCH37 expressed at higher levels in ESCC tissues than in \nadjacent tissues. b-AP15 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce G2/M cell \ncycle arrest and apoptosis in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, b-AP15 treatment \ntriggered Noxa-dependent apoptosis, which was regulated by c-Myc. Silencing Noxa \nand c-Myc could reduce b-AP15-induced apoptosis in ESCC cells. Our results \nrevealed a novel mechanism of anti-tumor activity of b-AP15 in ESCC, and b-AP15 \ncould be used as a potential therapeutic agent in ESCC.",

            "TEXT": "Activator protein-1 and caspase 8 mediate p38α MAPK-dependent cardiomyocyte \napoptosis induced by palmitic acid.\n\nLipoapoptosis of cardiomyocytes may underlie diabetic cardiomyopathy. Numerous \nforms of cardiomyopathies share a common end-pathway in which apoptotic loss of \ncardiomyocytes is mediated by p38α mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK). \nAlthough we have previously shown that palmitic acid (PA), a saturated fatty \nacid (SFA) elevated in plasma of type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity, \ninduces apoptosis in cardiomyocytes via p38α MAPK-dependent signaling, the \ndownstream cascade events that cause cell death remain unknown. The objective of \nthis study was to investigate mechanisms involved in palmitic acid-induced \ncardiomyocyte apoptosis. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte line (AC16 cells) \nexposed to high physiological levels of PA for 16 h showed enhanced \ntranscription and phosphorylation of c-fos and c-jun subunits of AP-1 and \ntranscription of caspase 8. When AC16 cells were transfected with small \ninterfering RNA specific against p38α MAPK (si-p38α) for 24 or 48 h, the \namplified phosphorylation of c-fos was dose-dependently attenuated, and \nprocaspase 8 was dose-dependently reduced. With translational knockdown of \nc-fos, PA-induced apoptosis was diminished. Inhibition of caspase 8 for 24 h \nreduced apoptosis in PA-treated cardiomyocytes. These findings provide evidence \nfor induction of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes exposed to high SFA by a novel \npathway requiring activation of c-fos/AP-1 and caspase 8. These results \ndemonstrate how elevated plasma SFA may lead to continual and cumulative loss of \ncardiomyocytes and potentially contribute to the development of diabetic \ncardiomyopathy.",

            "TEXT": "Overexpression of augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) mitigates the effect of \nH(2)O(2)-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in renal tubule epithelial cells.\n\nIschemia/reperfusion is a major cause of acute kidney injury and can induce \napoptosis in renal epithelial tubule (HK-2) cells. Accumulating evidence \nindicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a major contributor to \napoptosis in acute kidney injury. We previously reported that augmenter of liver \nregeneration (ALR) functions as an anti-apoptotic factor in H2O2-treated HK-2 \ncells although the precise mechanism underlying this action remains unclear. In \nthe present study, we investigate the role of ALR in H2O2-induced ER \nstress-mediated apoptosis. We overexpressed ALR and established a H2O2-induced \nER stress model in HK-2 cells. Overexpression of ALR reduced the level of \nreactive oxygen species and the rate of apoptosis in H2O2-treated HK-2 cells. \nUsing confocal microscopy and western blot, we observed that ALR colocalized \nwith the ER and mitochondria compartment. Moreover, ALR suppressed ER stress by \nmaintaining the morphology of the ER and reducing the levels of the ER-related \nproteins, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), phospho-protein kinase-like ER \nkinase (p-PERK), phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α) and \nC/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) significantly (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, ALR \npromoted Bcl-2 expression and suppressed Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 expression \nsignificantly during ER-stress induced apoptosis (p < 0.05). Furthermore, ALR \nattenuated calcium release from the ER, and transfer to mitochondria, under ER \nstress. To conclude, ALR alleviates H2O2-induced ER stress-mediated apoptosis in \nHK-2 cells by suppressing ER stress response and by maintaining calcium \nhomeostasis. Consequently, ALR may protect renal tubule epithelial cells from \nischemia/reperfusion induced acute kidney injury.",

However, its \nrole in acute kidney injury (AKI) is still unclear. Here, we induced AKI by \nbilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) of renal arteries or folic acid in \nlgmnWT and lgmnKO mice. We assessed serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, \nhistological indexes of tubular injury, and expression of KIM-1 and NGAL. \nInflammatory infiltration was evaluated by immunohistological staining of CD3 \nand F4/80, and expression of TNF-α, CCL-2, IL-33, and IL-1α. Ferroptosis was \nevaluated by Acsl4, Cox-2, reactive oxygen species (ROS) indexes H2DCFDA and \nDHE, MDA and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). We induced ferroptosis by hypoxia \nor erastin in primary mouse renal tubular epithelial cells (mRTECs). Cellular \nsurvival, Acsl4, Cox-2, LDH release, ROS, and MDA levels were measured. We \nanalyzed the degradation of GPX4 through inhibition of proteasomes or autophagy. \nLysosomal GPX4 was assessed to determine GPX4 degradation pathway. \nImmunoprecipitation (IP) was used to determine the interactions between \nlegumain, GPX4, HSC70, and HSP90. For tentative treatment, RR-11a was \nadministrated intraperitoneally to a mouse model of IRI-induced AKI. Our results \nshowed that legumain deficiency attenuated acute tubular injury, inflammation, \nand ferroptosis in either IRI or folic acid-induced AKI model. Ferroptosis \ninduced by hypoxia or erastin was dampened in lgmnKO mRTECs compared with lgmnWT \ncontrol. Deficiency of legumain prevented chaperone-mediated autophagy of GPX4. \nResults of IP suggested interactions between legumain, HSC70, HSP90, and GPX4. \nAdministration of RR-11a ameliorated ferroptosis and renal injury in the AKI \nmodel. Together, our data indicate that legumain promotes chaperone-mediated \nautophagy of GPX4 therefore facilitates tubular ferroptosis in AKI.",

Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of SYK in AML \ncells leads to increased differentiation, reduced proliferation, and cellular \napoptosis. Herein, we addressed the consequences of SYK inhibition to leukemia \nstem-cell (LSC) function and assessed SYK-associated pathways in AML cell \nbiology. Using gain-of-function MEK kinase mutant and constitutively active \nSTAT5A, we demonstrate that R406, the active metabolite of a small-molecule SYK \ninhibitor fostamatinib, induces differentiation and blocks clonogenic potential \nof AML cells through the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway and STAT5A transcription factor, \nrespectively. Pharmacological inhibition of SYK with R406 reduced LSC \ncompartment defined as CD34+CD38-CD123+ and CD34+CD38-CD25+ in vitro, and \ndecreased viability of LSCs identified by a low abundance of reactive oxygen \nspecies. Primary leukemic blasts treated ex vivo with R406 exhibited lower \nengraftment potential when xenotransplanted to immunodeficient NSG/J mice. \nMechanistically, these effects are mediated by disturbed mitochondrial \nbiogenesis and suppression of oxidative metabolism (OXPHOS) in LSCs. These \nmechanisms appear to be partially dependent on inhibition of STAT5 and its \ntarget gene MYC, a well-defined inducer of mitochondrial biogenesis. In \naddition, inhibition of SYK increases the sensitivity of LSCs to cytarabine \n(AraC), a standard of AML induction therapy. Taken together, our findings \nindicate that SYK fosters OXPHOS and participates in metabolic reprogramming of \nAML LSCs in a mechanism that at least partially involves STAT5, and that SYK \ninhibition targets LSCs in AML. Since active SYK is expressed in a majority of \nAML patients and confers inferior prognosis, the combination of SYK inhibitors \nwith standard chemotherapeutics such as AraC constitutes a new therapeutic \nmodality that should be evaluated in future clinical trials.",

            "TEXT": "Caspase-8, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), and RIPK3 regulate \nretinoic acid-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis.\n\nAmong caspase family members, Caspase-8 is unique, with associated critical \nactivities to induce and suppress death receptor-mediated apoptosis and \nnecroptosis, respectively. Caspase-8 inhibits necroptosis by suppressing the \nfunction of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1 or RIP1) and RIPK3 to \nactivate mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Disruption of Caspase-8 \nexpression causes embryonic lethality in mice, which is rescued by depletion of \neither Ripk3 or Mlkl, indicating that the embryonic lethality is caused by \nactivation of necroptosis. Here, we show that knockdown of Caspase-8 expression \nin embryoid bodies derived from ES cells markedly enhances retinoic acid \n(RA)-induced cell differentiation and necroptosis, both of which are dependent \non Ripk1 and Ripk3; however, the enhancement of RA-induced cell differentiation \nis independent of Mlkl and necrosome formation. RA treatment obviously enhanced \nthe expression of RA-specific target genes having the retinoic acid response \nelement (RARE) in their promoter regions to induce cell differentiation, and \ninduced marked expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and MLKL to stimulate necroptosis. \nCaspase-8 knockdown induced RIPK1 and RIPK3 to translocate into the nucleus and \nto form a complex with RA receptor (RAR), and RAR interacting with RIPK1 and \nRIPK3 showed much stronger binding activity to RARE than RAR without RIPK1 or \nRIPK3. In Caspase-8-deficient as well as Caspase-8- and Mlkl-deficient mouse \nembryos, the expression of RA-specific target genes was obviously enhanced. \nThus, Caspase-8, RIPK1, and RIPK3 regulate RA-induced cell differentiation and \nnecroptosis both in vitro and in vivo.",

            "TEXT": "Consequences of Zmat3 loss in c-MYC- and mutant KRAS-driven tumorigenesis.\n\nTP53 is a critical tumor suppressor that is mutated in approximately 50% of \nhuman cancers. Unveiling the downstream target genes of TP53 that fulfill its \ntumor suppressor function is an area of intense investigation. Zmat3 (also known \nas Wig-1 or PAG608) is one such downstream target of p53, whose loss in \nhemopoietic stem cells lacking the apoptosis and cell cycle regulators, Puma and \np21, respectively, promotes the development of leukemia. The function of Zmat3 \nin tumorigenesis however remains unclear. Here, to investigate which oncogenic \ndrivers co-operate with Zmat3 loss to promote neoplastic transformation, we \nutilized Zmat3 knockout mice in models of c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis and \nKrasG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma development. Interestingly, unlike loss of \np53, Zmat3 germline loss had little impact on the rate of tumor development or \nseverity of malignant disease upon either the c-MYC or KrasG12D oncogenic \nactivation. Furthermore, loss of Zmat3 failed to rescue KrasG12D primary lung \ntumor cells from oncogene-induced senescence. Taken together, we conclude that \nin the context of c-MYC-driven lymphomagenesis or mutant KrasG12D-driven lung \nadenocarcinoma development, additional co-occurring mutations are required to \nresolve Zmat3 tumor suppressive activity.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying \nhigh, constitutive NF-κB activity in GBM remains to be elucidated. Here, we \nscreened a panel of tripartite motif (TRIM) family proteins and identified \nTRIM22 as a potential activator of NF-κB using an NF-κB driven luciferase \nreporter construct in GBM cell lines. Knockout of TRIM22 using Cas9-sgRNAs led \nto reduced GBM cell proliferation, while TRIM22 overexpression enhanced \nproliferation of cell populations, in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft \nmodel. However, two TRIM22 mutants, one with a critical RING-finger domain \ndeletion and the other with amino acid changes at two active sites of RING E3 \nligase (C15/18A), were both unable to promote GBM cell proliferation over \ncontrols, thus implicating E3 ligase activity in the growth-promoting properties \nof TRIM22. Co-immunoprecipitations demonstrated that TRIM22 bound a negative \nregulator of NF-κB, NF-κB inhibitor alpha (IκBα), and accelerated its \ndegradation by inducing K48-linked ubiquitination. TRIM22 also formed a complex \nwith the NF-κB upstream regulator IKKγ and promoted K63-linked ubiquitination, \nwhich led to the phosphorylation of both IKKα/β and IκBα. Expression of a \nnon-phosphorylation mutant, srIκBα, inhibited the growth-promoting properties of \nTRIM22 in GBM cell lines. Finally, TRIM22 was increased in a cohort of primary \nGBM samples on a tissue microarray, and high expression of TRIM22 correlated \nwith other clinical parameters associated with progressive gliomas, such as \nwild-type IDH1 status. In summary, our study revealed that TRIM22 activated \nNF-κB signaling through posttranslational modification of two critical \nregulators of NF-κB signaling in GBM cells.",

            "TEXT": "The P2RY12 receptor promotes VSMC-derived foam cell formation by inhibiting \nautophagy in advanced atherosclerosis.\n\nVascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are an important source of foam cells in \natherosclerosis. The mechanism for VSMC-derived foam cell formation is, however, \npoorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the P2RY12/P2Y12 receptor is \nimportant in regulating macroautophagy/autophagy and VSMC-derived foam cell \nformation in advanced atherosclerosis. Inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor \nameliorated lipid accumulation and VSMC-derived foam cell formation in high-fat \ndiet-fed apoe-/- mice (atherosclerosis model) independent of LDL-c levels. \nActivation of the P2RY12 receptor blocked cholesterol efflux via PI3K-AKT, while \ngenetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor inhibited \nthis effect in VSMCs. Phosphoproteomic analysis showed that the P2RY12 receptor \nregulated the autophagy pathway in VSMCs. Additionally, activation of the P2RY12 \nreceptor inhibited MAP1LC3/LC3 maturation, SQSTM1 degradation, and autophagosome \nformation in VSMCs. Genetic knockdown of the essential autophagy gene Atg5 \nsignificantly attenuated P2RY12 receptor inhibitor-induced cholesterol efflux in \nVSMCs. Furthermore, activation of the P2RY12 receptor led to the activation of \nMTOR through PI3K-AKT in VSMCs, whereas blocking MTOR activity (rapamycin) or \nreducing MTOR expression reversed the inhibition of cholesterol efflux mediated \nby the P2RY12 receptor in VSMCs. In vivo, inhibition of the P2RY12 receptor \npromoted autophagy of VSMCs through PI3K-AKT-MTOR in advanced atherosclerosis in \napoe-/- mice, which could be impeded by an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine). \nTherefore, we conclude that activation of the P2RY12 receptor decreases \ncholesterol efflux and promotes VSMC-derived foam cell formation by blocking \nautophagy in advanced atherosclerosis. Our study thus suggests that the P2RY12 \nreceptor is a therapeutic target for treating atherosclerosis.",

Locally \nadvanced colon cancers often invade into surrounding adipose tissue with a \ndirect contact with adipocytes. We have previously shown that adipocytes promote \ntumor growth by modulating cellular metabolism. Here we demonstrate that \ncarnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1A), a key enzyme controlling fatty acid \noxidation (FAO), was upregulated in colon cancer cells upon exposure to \nadipocytes or fatty acids. In addition, CPT1A expression was increased in \ninvasive tumor cells within the adipose tissue compared to tumors without direct \ncontact with adipocytes. Silencing CPT1A abolished the protective effect \nprovided by fatty acids against nutrient deprivation and reduced tumor organoid \nformation in 3D culture and the expression of genes associated with cancer stem \ncells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin. Mechanistically, CPT1A-dependent FAO promoted \nthe acetylation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Furthermore, knockdown \nof CPT1A blocked the tumor-promoting effect of adipocytes in vivo and inhibited \nxenograft tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings identify CPT1A-depedent \nFAO as an essential metabolic pathway that enables the interaction between \nadipocytes and colon cancer cells.",

We show here that human non-small cell \nlung cancer (NSCLC) cell line-derived, quiescent-like, slow-cycling cancer cells \n(SCC) and residual patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors after chemotherapy \nexperience activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)-mediated upregulation of \nvarious cytokines, which acts in a paracrine manner to recruit fibroblasts. \nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) underwent transcriptional upregulation of \nCOX2 and type I collagen (Col-I), which subsequently triggered a slow-to-active \ncycling switch in SCC through prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)- and integrin/Src-mediated \nsignaling pathways, leading to cancer progression. Both antagonism of ATF6 and \ncotargeting of Src/COX2 effectively suppressed cytokine production and \nslow-to-active cell cycling transition in SCC, withholding cancer progression. \nExpression of COX2 and Col-I and activation of Src were observed in patients \nwith NSCLC who progressed while receiving chemotherapy. Public data analysis \nrevealed significant association between COL1A1 and SRC expression and NSCLC \nrelapse. Overall, these findings indicate that a proinflammatory niche created \nby the interplay between SCC and CAF triggers tumor progression.

In normal PMVECs, Bcl-2-shRNA or HRE combined with \nBcl-2-shRNA transduction successfully decreased Bcl-2 expression, while \nincreasing apoptosis as well as caspase-3 and P53 expression in a normoxic \nenvironment. In a hypoxic environment, the effects of Bcl-2-shRNA treatment on \ncell apoptosis, and on Bcl-2, caspase-3, P53 expression were significantly \nsuppressed. Conversely, HRE activation combined with Bcl-2-shRNA transduction \nmarkedly enhanced cell apoptosis and upregulated caspase-3 and P53 expression, \nwhile decreasing Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, in apoptosis-resistant PMVECs, \nHRE-mediated Bcl-2 silencing effectively enhanced cell apoptosis and caspase-3 \nactivity. The apoptosis rate was significantly depressed when Lv-HRE-Bcl-2-shRNA \nwas combined with Lv-P53-shRNA or Lv-caspase3-shRNA transduction in a hypoxic \nenvironment. These results suggest that HRE-mediated Bcl-2 inhibition can \neffectively attenuate hypoxia-induced apoptosis resistance in PMVECs by \ndownregulating Bcl-2 expression and upregulating caspase-3 and P53 expression. \nThis study therefore reveals critical insight into potential therapeutic targets \nfor treating PAH.",

            "TEXT": "CASP9 (caspase 9) is essential for autophagosome maturation through regulation \nof mitochondrial homeostasis.\n\nCASP9 (caspase 9) is a well-known initiator caspase which triggers intrinsic \napoptosis. Recent studies also suggest various non-apoptotic roles of CASP9, \nincluding macroautophagy/autophagy regulation. However, the involvement of CASP9 \nin autophagy and its molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Here we \nreport the non-apoptotic function of CASP9 in positive regulation of autophagy \nthrough maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis. Growth factor or amino acid \ndeprivation-induced autophagy activated CASP9, but without apoptotic features. \nPharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of CASP9 decreased autophagy \nflux, while ectopic expression of CASP9 rescued autophagy defects. In CASP9 \nknockout (KO) cells, initiation and elongation of phagophore membranes were \nnormal, but sealing of the membranes and autophagosome maturation were impaired, \nand the lifetime of autophagosomes was prolonged. Ablation of CASP9 caused an \naccumulation of inactive ATG3 and decreased lipidation of the Atg8-family \nmembers, most severely that of GABARAPL1. Moreover, it resulted in abnormal \nmitochondrial morphology with depolarization of the membrane potential, reduced \nreactive oxygen species production, and aberrant accumulation of mitochondrial \nfusion-fission proteins. CASP9 expression or exogenously added H2O2 in the CASP9 \nKO cells corrected the ATG3 level and lipidation status of Atg8-family members, \nand restored autophagy flux. Of note, only CASP9 expression but not H2O2 rescued \nmitochondrial defects, revealing regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by \nCASP9. Our findings suggest a new regulatory link between mitochondria and \nautophagy through CASP9 activity, especially for the proper operation of the \nAtg8-family conjugation system and autophagosome closure and maturation.",

            "TEXT": "The lncRNA PVT1 regulates nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell proliferation via \nactivating the KAT2A acetyltransferase and stabilizing HIF-1α.\n\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in regulating the development \nand progression of many cancers. However, the clinical significance of specific \nlncRNAs in the context of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and the molecular \nmechanisms by which they regulate this form of cancer remain largely unclear. In \nthis study we found that the lncRNA PVT1 was upregulated in NPC, and that in \npatients this upregulation was associated with reduced survival. RNA sequencing \nrevealed that PVT1 was responsible for regulating NPC cell proliferation and for \ncontrolling a hypoxia-related phenotype in these cells. PVT1 knockdown reduced \nNPC cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumorigenesis in a subcutaneous \nmouse xenograft model systems. We further found that PVT1 serves as a scaffold \nfor the chromatin modification factor KAT2A, which mediates histone 3 lysine 9 \nacetylation (H3K9), recruiting the nuclear receptor binding protein TIF1β to \nactivate NF90 transcription, thereby increasing HIF-1α stability and promoting a \nmalignant phenotype in NPC cells. Overexpression of NF90 or HIF-1α restored the \nproliferation in cells that had ceased proliferating due to PVT1 or KAT2A \ndepletion. Conversely, overexpression of active KAT2A or TIF1β, but not of KAT2A \nacetyltransferase activity-deficient mutants or TIF1β isoforms lacking H3K9ac \nbinding sites, promoted a PVT1-mediated increase in NF90 transcription, as well \nas increased HIF-1α stability and cell proliferation. PVT1 knockdown enhanced \nthe radiosensitization effect in NPC cells via inhibiting binding between H3K9ac \nand TIF1β in a manner. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PVT1 serves \nan oncogenic role and plays an important role in radiosensitivity in malignant \nNPC via activating the KAT2A acetyltransferase and stabilizing HIF-1α.",

            "TEXT": "Loss of HMBOX1 promotes LPS-induced apoptosis and inhibits LPS-induced autophagy \nof vascular endothelial cells in mouse.\n\nOur previous study revealed that Homeobox containing 1 (HMBOX1), essential for \nthe survival of vascular endothelial cells (VECs), was involved in the \nprogression of atherosclerosis. Knockdown of HMBOX1 promoted apoptosis and \ninhibited autophagy through regulating intracellular free zinc level in cultured \nVECs. In current study, in order to investigate the roles of HMBOX1 in vivo and \nin endothelium, we generated a knockout (KO) mouse for HMBOX1 by using \ntranscription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) technology. Herein, we \nreported that the protein level of HMBOX1 was gradually increased during mouse \ndevelopment. The HMBOX1 KO mouse was viable and fertile. There existed no \ndifferences in apoptosis and autophagy of aortic endothelial cells between wild \ntype and KO mouse. Whereas, loss of HMBOX1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited \nautophagy of aortic endothelial cells under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation \nin mouse. We also demonstrated that HMBOX1 deletion had no influence on the \nsecretion of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, overexpression or \nknockdown of HMBOX1 failed to regulate multiple pro-apoptotic genes expression \nin vitro. In conclusion, HMBOX1 participated in the functional maintenance of \nmouse aortic endothelial cells, the aortic endothelial cells of HMBOX1 KO mouse \nshowed increased apoptosis and decreased autophagy with LPS treatment.",

However, emerging evidence indicates \nthat IGF2BP2 plays a role in cancer, but the underlying mechanism is largely \nunknown. Here we showed that upregulation of IGF2BP2 is associated with poor \noutcomes of pancreatic cancer patients and suppression of IGF2BP2 inhibits cell \nproliferation. We further showed that IGF2BP2 regulates lncRNA DANCR. Ectopic \nexpression IGF2BP2 enhances, whereas knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of IGF2BP2 \nsuppresses DANCR expression. Moreover, in vivo RNA precipitation and reciprocal \nRNA immunoprecipitation revealed that IGF2BP2 interacts with DANCR. DANCR \npromotes cell proliferation and stemness-like properties. Experiments with \nxenograft models revealed that while ectopic expression of DANCR promotes, DANCR \nKO suppresses tumor growth. Mechanistically, DANCR is modified at \nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) and mutagenesis assay identified that adenosine at 664 \nof DANCR is critical to the interaction between IGF2BP2 and DANCR where IGF2BP2 \nserves a reader for m6A modified DANCR and stabilizes DANCR RNA. Together, these \nresults suggest that DANCR is a novel target for IGF2BP2 through m6A \nmodification, and IGF2BP2 and DANCR work together to promote cancer \nstemness-like properties and pancreatic cancer pathogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "Disrupting the TRIB3-SQSTM1 interaction reduces liver fibrosis by restoring \nautophagy and suppressing exosome-mediated HSC activation.\n\nImpaired macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic \nfibrosis. However, how aberrant autophagy promotes fibrosis is far from \nunderstood. Here, we aimed to define a previously unrevealed pro-fibrotic \nmechanism for the stress protein TRIB3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3)-mediated \nautophagy dysfunction. Human fibrotic liver tissues were obtained from patients \nwith cirrhosis who underwent an open surgical repair process. The functional \nimplications of TRIB3 were evaluated in mouse models of hepatic fibrosis induced \nby bile duct ligation (BDL) or thioacetamide (TAA) injection. Human fibrotic \nliver tissues expressed higher levels of TRIB3 and selective autophagic receptor \nSQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) than nonfibrotic tissues and the elevated expression \nof TRIB3 and SQSTM1 was positively correlated in the fibrotic tissues. Silencing \nTrib3 protected against experimentally induced hepatic fibrosis, accompanied by \nrestored autophagy activity in fibrotic liver tissues. Furthermore, TRIB3 \ninteracted with SQSTM1 and hindered its binding to MAP1LC3/LC3, which caused the \naccumulation of SQSTM1 aggregates and obstructed autophagic flux. The \nTRIB3-mediated autophagy impairment not only suppressed autophagic degradation \nof late endosomes but also promoted hepatocellular secretion of INHBA/Activin \nA-enriched exosomes which caused migration, proliferation and activation of \nhepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the effector cells of liver fibrosis. Disrupting \nthe TRIB3-SQSTM1 interaction with a specific helical peptide exerted potent \nprotective effects against hepatic fibrosis by restoring autophagic flux in \nhepatocytes and HSCs. Together, stress-elevated TRIB3 expression promotes \nhepatic fibrosis by interacting with SQSTM1 and interfering with its functions \nin liver-parenchymal cells and activating HSCs. Targeting this interaction is a \npromising strategy for treating fibroproliferative liver diseases.",

            "TEXT": "FNDC5 alleviates oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in \ndoxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via activating AKT.\n\nOxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis play critical roles in doxorubicin \n(DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. Previous studies indicated that fibronectin type \nIII domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) and its cleaved form, irisin, could preserve \nmitochondrial function and attenuate oxidative damage as well as cell apoptosis, \nhowever, its role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity remains unknown. Our present \nstudy aimed to investigate the role and underlying mechanism of FNDC5 on \noxidative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. \nCardiomyocyte-specific FNDC5 overexpression was achieved using an \nadeno-associated virus system, and then the mice were exposed to a single \nintraperitoneal injection of DOX (15 mg/kg) to generate DOX-induced \ncardiotoxicity. Herein, we found that FNDC5 expression was downregulated in \nDOX-treated murine hearts and cardiomyocytes. Fndc5 deficiency resulted in \nincreased oxidative damage and apoptosis in H9C2 cells under basal conditions, \nimitating the phenotype of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy in vitro, conversely, \nFNDC5 overexpression or irisin treatment alleviated DOX-induced oxidative stress \nand cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, we identified \nthat FNDC5/Irisin activated AKT/mTOR signaling and decreased DOX-induced \ncardiomyocyte apoptosis, and moreover, we provided direct evidence that the \nanti-oxidant effect of FNDC5/Irisin was mediated by the AKT/GSK3β/FYN/Nrf2 axis \nin an mTOR-independent manner. And we also demonstrated that heat shock protein \n20 was responsible for the activation of AKT caused by FNDC5/Irisin. In line \nwith the data in acute model, we also found that FNDC5/Irisin exerted beneficial \neffects in chronic model of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (5 mg/kg, i.p., once a \nweek for three times, the total cumulative dose is 15 mg/kg) in mice. Based on \nthese findings, we supposed that FNDC5/Irisin was a potential therapeutic agent \nagainst DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",

However, its precise role remains unclear, as both amplifications \nand inactivating mutations in TRPS1 have been reported. Here, we used in vitro \nand in vivo loss-of-function approaches to dissect the role of TRPS1 in mammary \ngland development and invasive lobular breast carcinoma, which is hallmarked by \nfunctional loss of E-cadherin. We show that TRPS1 is essential in mammary \nepithelial cells, since TRPS1-mediated suppression of interferon signaling \npromotes in vitro proliferation and lactogenic differentiation. Similarly, TRPS1 \nexpression is indispensable for proliferation of mammary organoids and in vivo \nsurvival of luminal epithelial cells during mammary gland development. However, \nthe consequences of TRPS1 loss are dependent on E-cadherin status, as combined \ninactivation of E-cadherin and TRPS1 causes persistent proliferation of mammary \norganoids and accelerated mammary tumor formation in mice. Together, our results \ndemonstrate that TRPS1 can function as a context-dependent tumor suppressor in \nbreast cancer, while being essential for growth and differentiation of normal \nmammary epithelial cells.",

            "TEXT": "KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 [lung]) regulates osteoclastogenesis by modulating \nautophagy.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is involved in myeloid cellular repair, destruction, \nand osteoclast differentiation; conversely, KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 [lung]) \nregulates myeloid cell activation and differentiation. To investigate the \nspecific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in \nmonocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine \n(3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and \nadenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells \nand multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, \nGGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these \nprocesses. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly \ndecreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic \ndifferentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level \nof Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic \ndifferentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of \nBeclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the \nlevel of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid \ncell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules \n(CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27kip1). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of \nBecn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone \nactivation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and \noverexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In \naddition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 \nacetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the \nfirst time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy \nprocess during osteoclastogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "Artemisinin compounds sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis by regulating iron \nhomeostasis.\n\nThe antimalarial drug artemisinin and its derivatives have been explored as \npotential anticancer agents, but their underlying mechanisms are controversial. \nIn this study, we found that artemisinin compounds can sensitize cancer cells to \nferroptosis, a new form of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid \nperoxidation. Mechanistically, dihydroartemisinin (DAT) can induce lysosomal \ndegradation of ferritin in an autophagy-independent manner, increasing the \ncellular free iron level and causing cells to become more sensitive to \nferroptosis. Further, by associating with cellular free iron and thus \nstimulating the binding of iron-regulatory proteins (IRPs) with mRNA molecules \ncontaining iron-responsive element (IRE) sequences, DAT impinges on \nIRP/IRE-controlled iron homeostasis to further increase cellular free iron. \nImportantly, in both in vitro and a mouse xenograft model in which ferroptosis \nwas triggered in cancer cells by the inducible knockout of GPX4, we found that \nDAT can augment GPX4 inhibition-induced ferroptosis in a cohort of cancer cells \nthat are otherwise highly resistant to ferroptosis. Collectively, artemisinin \ncompounds can sensitize cells to ferroptosis by regulating cellular iron \nhomeostasis. Our findings can be exploited clinically to enhance the effect of \nfuture ferroptosis-inducing cancer therapies.",

            "TEXT": "Nucleoporin 210 serves a key scaffold for SMARCB1 in liver cancer.\n\nThe roles of chromatin remodelers and their underlying mechanisms of action in \ncancer remain unclear. In this study, SMARCB1, known initially as a bona fide \ntumor suppressor gene, was investigated in liver cancer. SMARCB1 was highly \nupregulated in liver cancer patients and was associated with poor prognosis. \nLoss- and gain-of-function studies in liver cells revealed that SMARCB1 loss led \nto reduced cell proliferation, wound healing capacity, and tumor growth in vivo. \nAnd although upregulated SMARCB1 appeared to contribute to SWItch/Sucrose \nNon-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) complex stability and integrity, it did not act using \nits known pathways antagonism with EZH2 or association between TP53 or AMPK. \nSMARCB1 knockdown induced a mild reduction in global H3K27 acetylation, and \nchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of SMARCB1 and acetylated histone H3K27 \nantibodies before and after SMARCB1 loss identified Nucleoporin210 (NUP210) as a \ncritical target of SMARCB1, which bound its enhancer and changed H3K27Ac \nenrichment and downstream gene expression, particularly cholesterol homeostasis \nand xenobiotic metabolism. Notably, NUP210 was not only a putative tumor \nsupporter involved in liver cancer but also acted as a key scaffold for SMARCB1 \nand P300 to chromatin. Furthermore, SMARCB1 deficiency conferred sensitivity to \ndoxorubicin and P300 inhibitor in liver cancer cells. These findings provide \ninsights into mechanisms underlying dysregulation of chromatin remodelers and \nshow novel associations between nucleoporins and chromatin remodelers in cancer.",

            "TEXT": "miR-322/-503 rescues myoblast defects in myotonic dystrophy type 1 cell model by \ntargeting CUG repeats.\n\nMyotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is the most common type of adult muscular \ndystrophy caused by the expanded triple-nucleotides (CUG) repeats. Myoblast in \nDM1 displayed many defects, including defective myoblast differentiation, \nribonuclear foci, and aberrant alternative splicing. Despite many were revealed \nto function in DM1, microRNAs that regulated DM1 via directly targeting the \nexpanded CUG repeats were rarely reported. Here we discovered that miR-322/-503 \nrescued myoblast defects in DM1 cell model by targeting the expanded CUG \nrepeats. First, we studied the function of miR-322/-503 in normal C2C12 myoblast \ncells. Downregulation of miR-322/-503 significantly hindered the myoblast \ndifferentiation, while miR-322/-503 overexpression promoted the process. Next, \nwe examined the role of miR-322/-503 in the DM1 C2C12 cell model. miR-322/-503 \nwas downregulated in the differentiation of DM1 C2C12 cells. When we introduced \nectopic miR-322/-503 expression into DM1 C2C12 cells, myoblast defects were \nalmost fully rescued, marked by significant improvements of myoblast \ndifferentiation and repressions of ribonuclear foci formation and aberrant \nalternative splicing. Then we investigated the downstream mechanism of \nmiR-322/-503 in DM1. Agreeing with our previous work, Celf1 was proven to be \nmiR-322/-503's target. Celf1 knockdown partially reproduced miR-322/-503's \nfunction in rescuing DM1 C2C12 differentiation but was unable to repress \nribonuclear foci, suggesting other targets of miR-322/-503 existed in the DM1 \nC2C12 cells. As the seed regions of miR-322 and miR-503 were complementary to \nthe CUG repeats, we hypothesized that the CUG repeats were the target of \nmiR-322/-503. Through expression tests, reporter assays, and colocalization \nstaining, miR-322/-503 was proved to directly and specifically target the \nexpanded CUG repeats in the DM1 cell model rather than the shorter ones in \nnormal cells. Those results implied a potential therapeutic function of \nmiR-322/-503 on DM1, which needed further investigations in the future.",

            "TEXT": "ASH2L drives proliferation and sensitivity to bleomycin and other genotoxins in \nHodgkin's lymphoma and testicular cancer cells.\n\nIt is of clinical importance to identify biomarkers predicting the efficacy of \nDNA damaging drugs (genotoxins) so that nonresponders are not unduly exposed to \nthe deleterious effects of otherwise inefficient drugs. Here, we initially \nfocused on the bleomycin genotoxin because of the limited information about the \ngenes implicated in the sensitivity or resistance to this compound. Using a \nwhole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockout approach, we identified ASH2L, a core \ncomponent of the H3K4 methyl transferase complex, as a protein required for \nbleomycin sensitivity in L1236 Hodgkin lymphoma. Knocking down ASH2L in these \ncells and in the NT2D1 testicular cancer cell line rendered them resistant to \nbleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin but did not affect their sensitivity toward \nATM or ATR inhibitors. ASH2L knockdown decreased cell proliferation and \nfacilitated DNA repair via homologous recombination and nonhomologous \nend-joining mechanisms. Data from the Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas indicate that \npatients with testicular cancer carrying alterations in the ASH2L gene are more \nlikely to relapse than patients with unaltered ASH2L genes. The cell models we \nhave used are derived from cancers currently treated either partially (Hodgkin's \nlymphoma), or entirely (testicular cancer) with genotoxins. For such cancers, \nASH2L levels could be used as a biomarker to predict the response to genotoxins. \nIn situations where tumors are expressing low levels of ASH2L, which may allow \nthem to resist genotoxic treatment, the use of ATR or ATM inhibitors may be more \nefficacious as our data indicate that ASH2L knockdown does not affect \nsensitivity to these inhibitors.",

An \nimbalance between the production and clearance of Aβ (amyloid beta) is \nconsidered to be actively involved in AD pathogenesis. Macroautophagy/autophagy \nis a major cellular pathway leading to the removal of aggregated proteins, and \nupregulation of autophagy represents a plausible therapeutic strategy to combat \noverproduction of neurotoxic Aβ. PPARA/PPARα (peroxisome proliferator activated \nreceptor alpha) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in fatty \nacid metabolism and activates hepatic autophagy. We hypothesized that PPARA \nregulates autophagy in the nervous system and PPARA-mediated autophagy affects \nAD. We found that pharmacological activation of PPARA by the PPARA agonists \ngemfibrozil and Wy14643 induces autophagy in human microglia (HM) cells and U251 \nhuman glioma cells stably expressing the human APP (amyloid beta precursor \nprotein) mutant (APP-p.M671L) and this effect is PPARA-dependent. Administration \nof PPARA agonists decreases amyloid pathology and reverses memory deficits and \nanxiety symptoms in APP-PSEN1ΔE9 mice. There is a reduced level of soluble Aβ \nand insoluble Aβ in hippocampus and cortex tissues from APP-PSEN1ΔE9 mice after \ntreatment with either gemfibrozil or Wy14643, which promoted the recruitment of \nmicroglia and astrocytes to the vicinity of Aβ plaques and enhanced \nautophagosome biogenesis. These results indicated that PPARA is an important \nfactor regulating autophagy in the clearance of Aβ and suggested gemfibrozil be \nassessed as a possible treatment for AD.",

DHD is associated \nwith the progressive loss of cardiovascular cells through the alteration of \nmolecular signalling pathways associated with cell death. In this study, we \nsought to determine whether diabetes induces dysregulation of miR-532 and if \nthis is associated with accentuated apoptosis. RT-PCR analysis showed a \nsignificant increase in miR-532 expression in the right atrial appendage tissue \nof type 2 diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. \nThis was associated with marked downregulation of its anti-apoptotic target \nprotein apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) and increased \nTUNEL positive cardiomyocytes. Further analysis showed a positive correlation \nbetween apoptosis and miR-532 levels. Time-course experiments in a mouse model \nof type 2 diabetes showed that diabetes-induced activation of miR-532 occurs in \nthe later stage of the disease. Importantly, the upregulation of miR-532 \npreceded the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3/7 activity. Finally, \ninhibition of miR-532 activity in high glucose cultured human cardiomyocytes \nprevented the downregulation of ARC and attenuated apoptotic cell death. \nDiabetes induced activation of miR-532 plays a critical role in accelerating \ncardiomyocytes apoptosis. Therefore, miR-532 may serve as a promising \ntherapeutic agent to overcome the diabetes-induced loss of cardiomyocytes.",

However, the expression level and \nfunction of LINC01559 (long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1559) in gastric \ncancer (GC) are rarely reported. Here we found that LINC01559 was upregulated in \nGC tissues based on GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) and \nTCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) databases. Also, LINC01559 was expressed at a \nlower level in GC cells than in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In vitro \nexperiments revealed that silencing LINC01559 remarkably hindered GC cell \nproliferation, migration and stemness. Then, we identified that LINC01559 was \ntransmitted form MSCs to GC cells via the exosomes. Immunofluorescence staining \nand electron microscope validated the existence of exosomes in GC cells. \nMechanistically, LINC01559 sponged miR-1343-3p to upregulate PGK1 \n(phosphoglycerate kinase 1), therefore activating PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, \nLINC01559 recruited EZH2 (enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 \nsubunit) to PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) promoter, inducing the \nmethylation of PTEN promoter and finally resulting in PTEN repression. Of note, \nLINC01559 targeted both PGK1 and PTEN to promote GC progression by activating \nPI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our study demonstrated that LINC01559 \naccelerated GC progression via upregulating PGK1 and downregulating PTEN to \ntrigger phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT serine/threonine kinase (PI3K/AKT) \npathway, indicating LINC01559 as a potential biomarker for GC treatment.",

            "TEXT": "GABPA is a master regulator of luminal identity and restrains aggressive \ndiseases in bladder cancer.\n\nTERT promoter mutations occur in the majority of glioblastoma, bladder cancer \n(BC), and other malignancies while the ETS family transcription factors GABPA \nand its partner GABPB1 activate the mutant TERT promoter and telomerase in these \ntumors. GABPA depletion or the disruption of the GABPA/GABPB1 complex by \nknocking down GABPB1 was shown to inhibit telomerase, thereby eliminating the \ntumorigenic potential of glioblastoma cells. GABPA/B1 is thus suggested as a \ncancer therapeutic target. However, it is unclear about its role in BC. Here we \nunexpectedly observed that GABPA ablation inhibited TERT expression, but \nrobustly increased proliferation, stem, and invasive phenotypes and cisplatin \nresistance in BC cells, while its overexpression exhibited opposite effects, and \ninhibited in vivo metastasizing in a xenograft transplant model. \nMechanistically, GABPA directly activates the transcription of FoxA1 and GATA3, \nkey transcription factors driving luminal differentiation of urothelial cells. \nConsistently, TCGA/GEO dataset analyses show that GABPA expression is correlated \npositively with luminal while negatively with basal signatures. Luminal tumors \nexpress higher GABPA than do basal ones. Lower GABPA expression is associated \nwith the GABPA gene methylation or deletion (especially in basal subtype of BC \ntumors), and predicted significantly shorter patient survival based on TCGA and \nour cohort of BC patient analyses. Taken together, GABPA dictates luminal \nidentity of BC cells and inhibits aggressive diseases in BC by promoting \ncellular differentiation despite its stimulatory effect on telomerase/TERT \nactivation. Given these biological functions and its frequent methylation and/or \ndeletion, GABPA serves as a tumor suppressor rather than oncogenic factor in BC. \nThe GABPA effect on oncogenesis is context-dependent and its targeting for \ntelomerase inhibition in BC may promote disease metastasizing.",

Here, we investigate the \ninfluence of the nutrient sensing and longevity-assuring enzyme SIRT6 on the \ndynamics of apoptosis triggered by serum starvation. Specifically, we \ncharacterize the progression of apoptosis in wild type and SIRT6 deficient mouse \nembryonic fibroblasts using time-lapse flow cytometry and computational \nmodelling based on rate-equations and cell distribution analysis. We find that \nSIRT6 deficient cells resist apoptosis by delaying its initiation. \nInterestingly, once apoptosis is initiated, the rate of its progression is \nhigher in SIRT6 null cells compared to identically cultured wild type cells. \nHowever, SIRT6 null cells succumb to apoptosis more slowly, not only in response \nto nutrient deprivation but also in response to other stresses. Our data suggest \nthat SIRT6 plays a role in several distinct steps of apoptosis. Overall, we \ndemonstrate the utility of our computational model to describe stages of \napoptosis progression and the integrity of the cellular membrane. Such \nmeasurements will be useful in a broad range of biological applications.",

Therefore, inhibitors of amino acid transporters, \nsuch as L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) have been developed. In this \nstudy, a previously reported LAT1-inhibitor (KMH-233) was studied for its \nhemocompatibility and toxicity towards human umbilical vein endothelial cells \n(HUVEC) and human aortic smooth muscle cells (AoSMCs). Furthermore, the \ncytotoxic effects against human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7) and its \nability to affect mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) and \nnuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling \nwere evaluated. Moreover, the effects of this inhibitor to modulate LAT1 \nfunction on the cell surface and the brain amino acid homeostasis were evaluated \nafter intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of LAT1-inhibitor (23 µmol/kg) in \nmice. The results showed that LAT1-inhibitor (KMH-233) is hemocompatible at \nconcentrations below 25 µM and it does not affect coagulation in plasma. \nHowever, it can reduce the total protein amount of mTOR and NF-κB, resulting in \nincreased apoptosis in LAT1-expressing cancer cells. Most importantly, the \ninhibitor did not affect mouse brain levels of L-Leu, L-Tyr or L-Trp or modulate \nthe function of LAT1 on the MCF-7 cell surface. Therefore, this inhibitor can be \nconsidered as a safe but effective anti-cancer agent. However, due to the \ncompensative mechanism of cancer cells for their increased amino acid demand, \nthis compound is most effective inducing apoptosis when used in combinations \nwith other chemotherapeutics, such as protease inhibitor, bestatin, as \ndemonstrated in this study.",

            "TEXT": "Inhibition of SIRT1/2 upregulates HSPA5 acetylation and induces pro-survival \nautophagy via ATF4-DDIT4-mTORC1 axis in human lung cancer cells.\n\nSirtuins have emerged as a promising novel class of anti-cancer drug targets. \nInhibition of SIRT1 and SIRT2 induces apoptosis in cancer cells and they play \nmultifaceted roles in regulating autophagy. In the present study, we found that \nsalermide, a SIRT1/2-specific inhibitor or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to \nblock SIRT1/2 expression could induce autophagy in human NSCLC cells. Moreover, \nSIRT1/2 inhibition increased the expression levels of ATF4 and DDIT4 and \ndownregulated p-RPS6KB1 and p-EIF4EBP1, two downstream molecules of mTORC1. \nMoreover, ATF4 or DDIT4 knockdown attenuated salermide-induced autophagy, \nsuggesting that SIRT1/2 inhibition induced autophagy through the \nATF4-DDIT4-mTORC1 axis. Mechanistically, SIRT1/2 inhibition led to HSPA5 \nacetylation and dissociation from EIF2AK3, leading to ER stress response and \nfollowed by upregulation of ATF4 and DDIT4, triggering autophagy. Silencing of \nthe autophagic gene ATG5 in lung cancer cells resulted in increased apoptotic \ncell death induced by SIRT1/2 inhibition. Our data show that inhibition of \nSIRT1/2 induces pro-survival autophagy via acetylation of HSPA5 and subsequent \nactivation of ATF4 and DDIT4 to inhibit the mTOR signaling pathway in NSCLC \ncells. These findings suggest that combinatorial treatment with SIRT1/2 \ninhibitors and pharmacological autophagy inhibitors is an effective therapeutic \nstrategy for cancer therapy.",

            "TEXT": "Autophagy drives fibroblast senescence through MTORC2 regulation.\n\nSustained macroautophagy/autophagy favors the differentiation of fibroblasts \ninto myofibroblasts. Cellular senescence, another means of responding to \nlong-term cellular stress, has also been linked to myofibroblast differentiation \nand fibrosis. Here, we evaluate the relationship between senescence and \nmyofibroblast differentiation in the context of sustained autophagy. We analyzed \nmarkers of cell cycle arrest/senescence in fibroblasts in vitro, where autophagy \nwas triggered by serum starvation (SS). Autophagic fibroblasts expressed the \nsenescence biomarkers CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN2A/p16 and exhibited increased \nsenescence-associated GLB1/beta-galactosidase activity. Inhibition of autophagy \nin serum-starved fibroblasts with 3-methyladenine, LY294002, or ATG7 (autophagy \nrelated 7) silencing prevented the expression of senescence-associated markers. \nSimilarly, suppressing MTORC2 activation using rapamycin or by silencing RICTOR \nalso prevented senescence hallmarks. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that \nsenescence and myofibroblast differentiation were induced in different cells, \nsuggesting mutually exclusive activation of senescence and myofibroblast \ndifferentiation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known inducers of senescence \nand exposing fibroblasts to ROS scavengers decreased ROS production during SS, \ninhibited autophagy, and significantly reduced the expression of senescence and \nmyofibroblast differentiation markers. ROS scavengers also curbed the AKT1 \nphosphorylation at Ser473, an MTORC2 target, establishing the importance of ROS \nin fueling MTORC2 activation. Inhibition of senescence by shRNA to TP53/p53 and \nshRNA CDKN2A/p16 increased myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a negative \nfeedback loop of senescence on autophagy-induced myofibroblast differentiation. \nCollectively, our results identify ROS as central inducers of MTORC2 activation \nduring chronic autophagy, which in turn fuels senescence activation and \nmyofibroblast differentiation in distinct cellular subpopulations.",

Elevated expression of human telomerase reverse \ntranscriptase (TERT) is an important hallmark in cancers, but the mechanism by \nwhich TERT is activated differentially in cancers is poorly understood. Here, we \nhave identified nuclear receptor coactivator-3 (NCOA3) as a new modulator of \nTERT expression and tumor growth in HCC. NACO3 specifically binds to the TERT \npromoter at the -234 to -144 region and transcriptionally activates TERT \nexpression. NCOA3 promotes HCC cell growth and tumor progression in vitro and in \nvivo through upregulating the TERT signaling. Knockdown of NACO3 suppresses HCC \ncell viability and colony formation, whereas TERT overexpression rescues this \nsuppression. NCOA3 interacts with and recruits SP1 binding on the TERT promoter. \nKnockdown of NCOA3 also inhibits the expression of the Wnt signaling-related \ngenes but has no effect on the Notch signaling-targeting genes. Moreover, NCOA3 \nis positively correlated with TERT expression in HCC tumor tissues, and high \nexpression of both NCOA3 and TERT predicts a poor prognosis in HCC patients. Our \nfindings indicate that targeting the NCOA3-SP1-TERT signaling axis may benefit \nHCC patients.",

Ferroptosis \nis a nonapoptotic form of cell death dependent upon intracellular iron. However, \nthe involvement of ferroptosis in the pathogenesis of AD remains elusive. Here, \nwe report that ferroportin1 (Fpn), the only identified mammalian nonheme iron \nexporter, was downregulated in the brains of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice as an \nAlzheimer's mouse model and Alzheimer's patients. Genetic deletion of Fpn in \nprincipal neurons of the neocortex and hippocampus by breeding Fpnfl/fl mice \nwith NEX-Cre mice led to AD-like hippocampal atrophy and memory deficits. \nInterestingly, the canonical morphological and molecular characteristics of \nferroptosis were observed in both Fpnfl/fl/NEXcre and AD mice. Gene set \nenrichment analysis (GSEA) of ferroptosis-related RNA-seq data showed that the \ndifferentially expressed genes were highly enriched in gene sets associated with \nAD. Furthermore, administration of specific inhibitors of ferroptosis \neffectively reduced the neuronal death and memory impairments induced by Aβ \naggregation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, restoring Fpn ameliorated \nferroptosis and memory impairment in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Our study demonstrates \nthe critical role of Fpn and ferroptosis in the progression of AD, thus provides \npromising therapeutic approaches for this disease.",

Multiple bioinformatic analyses of different human cancer \ndatabases identified key m6A-associated genetic mutations that regulated gastric \ntumorigenesis. YTHDF1 was mutated in about 7% of gastric cancer patients and \nhigh expression of YTHDF1 was associated with more aggressive tumor progression \nand poor overall survival. Inhibition of YTHDF1 attenuated GC cell proliferation \nand tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YTHDF1 promoted the \ntranslation of a key Wnt receptor frizzled7 (FZD7) in an m6A-dependent manner, \nand mutated YTHDF1 enhanced expression of FZD7, leading to hyper-activation of \nthe Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promotion of gastric carcinogenesis. Our results \ndemonstrate the oncogenic role of YTHDF1 and its m6A-mediated regulation of \nWnt/β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer, providing a novel approach of \ntargeting such epigenetic regulators in this disease.",

            "TEXT": "Circular RNA circAGO2 drives cancer progression through facilitating \nHuR-repressed functions of AGO2-miRNA complexes.\n\nArgonaute 2 (AGO2), the core component of microRNA (miRNA)-induced silencing \ncomplex, plays a compelling role in tumorigenesis and aggressiveness. However, \nthe mechanisms regulating the functions of AGO2 in cancer still remain elusive. \nHerein, we indentify one intronic circular RNA (circRNA) generated from AGO2 \ngene (circAGO2) as a novel regulator of AGO2-miRNA complexes and cancer \nprogression. CircAGO2 is up-regulated in gastric cancer, colon cancer, prostate \ncancer, and neuroblastoma, and is associated with poor prognosis of patients. \nCircAGO2 promotes the growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells in vitro \nand in vivo. Mechanistic studies reveal that circAGO2 physically interacts with \nhuman antigen R (HuR) protein to facilitate its activation and enrichment on the \n3'-untranslated region of target genes, resulting in reduction of AGO2 binding \nand repression of AGO2/miRNA-mediated gene silencing associated with cancer \nprogression. Pre-clinically, administration of lentivirus-mediated short hairpin \nRNA targeting circAGO2 inhibits the expression of downstream target genes, and \nsuppresses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of xenografts in nude mice. In \naddition, blocking the interaction between circAGO2 and HuR by cell-penetrating \ninhibitory peptide represses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of cancer \ncells. Taken together, these results indicate that oncogenic circAGO2 drives \ncancer progression through facilitating HuR-repressed functions of AGO2-miRNA \ncomplexes.",

            "TEXT": "TNF-α-elicited miR-29b potentiates resistance to apoptosis in peripheral blood \nmonocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nCD14-positive monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more \nresistant to apoptosis, which promotes their persistence at the inflammatory \nsite and thereby contributes crucially to immunopathology. We sought to \nelucidate one mechanism underlying this unique pathogenesis: resistance to \napoptosis and the potential involvement of miR-29b in this process. \nCD14-positive peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) from RA patients were observed \nto be resistant to spontaneous apoptosis compared to PBMs from healthy \nvolunteers. Intriguingly, expression of miR-29b was significantly upregulated in \nPBMs from RA patients than those from healthy volunteers, and this upregulation \nwas correlated with RA disease activity. Functionally, forced expression of the \nexogenous miR-29b in CD14-positive Ctrl PBMs conferred resistance to spontaneous \napoptosis and Fas-induced death, thereafter enhancing the production of major \nproinflammatory cytokines in there cells. Following identification of the \npotential miR-29b target transcripts using bioinformatic algorithms, we showed \nthat miR-29b could directly bind to the 3'-UTR of the high-mobility group \nbox-containing protein 1 (HBP1) and inhibited its transcription in PBMs. \nImportantly, stable expression of the exogenous HBP1 in differentiated THP-1 \nmonocytes effectively abolished miR-29b-elicited resistance to Fas-induced \napoptosis. Finally, among patients with RA and good clinical responses to \nimmunotherapy, expression levels of miR-29b were significantly compromised in \nthose treated with infliximab (a TNF-α inhibitor) but not in those treated with \ntocilizumab (a humanized mAb against the IL-6 receptor), pointing to a potential \nassociation between miR-29b activation and TNF-α induction. The available data \ncollectively suggest that TNF-α-elicited miR-29b potentiates resistance to \napoptosis in PBMs from RA patients via inhibition of HBP1 signaling, and testing \npatients for miR-29b/HBP1 expression ratios may provide more accurate prognostic \ninformation and could influence the recommended course of immunotherapy.",

Here, we showed that TXNDC12, a \nthioredoxin-like protein, was upregulated in highly metastatic HCC cell lines as \nwell as in portal vein tumor thrombus and lung metastasis tissues of HCC \npatients. We found that the enforced expression of TXNDC12 promoted metastasis \nboth in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent mechanistic investigations revealed that \nTXNDC12 promoted metastasis through upregulation of the ZEB1-mediated \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. We subsequently showed that \nTXNDC12 overexpression stimulated the nuclear translocation and activation of \nβ-catenin, a positive transcriptional regulator of ZEB1. Accordingly, we found \nthat TXNDC12 interacted with β-catenin and that the thioredoxin-like domain of \nTXNDC12 was essential for the interaction between TXNDC12 and β-catenin as well \nas for TXNDC12-mediated β-catenin activation. Moreover, high levels of TXNDC12 \nin clinical HCC tissues correlated with elevated nuclear β-catenin levels and \npredicted worse overall and disease-free survival.

            "TEXT": "AFP promotes HCC progression by suppressing the HuR-mediated Fas/FADD apoptotic \npathway.\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major leading cause of cancer-related death \nworldwide. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is reactivated in a majority of \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with poor patient outcomes. \nAlthough increasing evidence has shown that AFP can regulate HCC cell growth, \nthe precise functions of AFP in hepatocarcinogenesis and the associated \nunderlying mechanism remain incompletely understood. In this study, we \ndemostrated that depleting AFP significantly suppressed diethylnitrosamine \n(DEN)-induced liver tumor progression in an AFP gene-deficient mouse model. \nSimilarly, knocking down AFP expression inhibited human HCC cell proliferation \nand tumor growth by inducing apoptosis. AFP expression level was inversely \nassociated with the apoptotic rate in mouse and human HCC specimens. \nInvestigation of potential cross-talk between AFP and apoptotic signaling \nrevealed that AFP exerted its growth-promoting effect by suppressing the \nFas/FADD-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Mechanistically, AFP bound to the \nRNA-binding protein HuR, increasing the accumulation of HuR in the cytoplasm and \nsubsequent inhibition of Fas mRNA translation. In addition, we found that \ninhibiting AFP enhanced the cytotoxicity of therapeutics to AFP-positive HCC \ncells by activating HuR-mediated Fas/FADD apoptotic signaling. Conclusion: Our \nstudy defined the pro-oncogenic role of AFP in HCC progression and uncovered a \nnovel antiapoptotic mechanism connecting AFP to HuR-mediated Fas translation. \nOur findings suggest that AFP is involved in the pathogenesis and \nchemosensitivity of HCC and that blockade of AFP may be a promising strategy to \ntreat advanced HCC.",

However, the potential involvement of lncRNAs in \nmacroautophagy/autophagy is largely unknown. Autophagy is a highly regulated \ncellular degradation system, and its dysregulation is involved in many human \ndiseases, including cancers. Here, we show that the lncRNA ZNNT1 is induced by \nPP242 and MTORC1 selective inhibitor rapamycin in uveal melanoma (UM) cells. \nOverexpression of ZNNT1 promotes autophagy by upregulating ATG12 expression, \nwhereas knockdown of ZNNT1 attenuates PP242-induced autophagy. Overexpression of \nZNNT1 inhibits tumorigenesis and the migration of UM cells, and knockdown of \nATG12 can partially rescue the ZNNT1-induced inhibition of UM tumorigenesis. In \nsummary, our study reveals that ZNNT1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in UM \nby inducing autophagy.",

            "TEXT": "m(6)A mRNA methylation controls autophagy and adipogenesis by targeting Atg5 and \nAtg7.\n\nN: 6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant internal modification on mRNAs in \neukaryotes, play roles in adipogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism \nremains largely unclear. Here, we show that m6A plays a critical role in \nregulating macroautophagy/autophagy and adipogenesis through targeting Atg5 and \nAtg7. Mechanistically, knockdown of FTO, a well-known m6A demethylase, decreased \nthe expression of ATG5 and ATG7, leading to attenuation of autophagosome \nformation, thereby inhibiting autophagy and adipogenesis. We proved that FTO \ndirectly targeted Atg5 and Atg7 transcripts and mediated their expression in an \nm6A-dependent manner. Further study identified that Atg5 and Atg7 were the \ntargets of YTHDF2 (YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2). Upon FTO \nsilencing, Atg5 and Atg7 transcripts with higher m6A levels were captured by \nYTHDF2, which resulted in mRNA degradation and reduction of protein expression, \nthus alleviating autophagy and adipogenesis. Furthermore, we generated an \nadipose-selective fto knockout mouse and find that FTO deficiency decreased \nwhite fat mass and impairs ATG5- and ATG7-dependent autophagy in vivo. Together, \nthese findings unveil the functional importance of the m6A methylation machinery \nin autophagy and adipogenesis regulation, which expands our understanding of \nsuch interplay that is essential for development of therapeutic strategies in \nthe prevention and treatment of obesity.",

            "TEXT": "Neat1 is a p53-inducible lincRNA essential for transformation suppression.\n\nThe p53 gene is mutated in over half of all cancers, reflecting its critical \nrole as a tumor suppressor. Although p53 is a transcriptional activator that \ninduces myriad target genes, those p53-inducible genes most critical for tumor \nsuppression remain elusive. Here, we leveraged p53 ChIP-seq (chromatin \nimmunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) and RNA-seq \n(RNA sequencing) data sets to identify new p53 target genes, focusing on the \nnoncoding genome. We identify Neat1, a noncoding RNA (ncRNA) constituent of \nparaspeckles, as a p53 target gene broadly induced by mouse and human p53 in \ndifferent cell types and by diverse stress signals. Using fibroblasts derived \nfrom Neat1-/- mice, we examined the functional role of Neat1 in the p53 pathway. \nWe found that Neat1 is dispensable for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in \nresponse to genotoxic stress. In sharp contrast, Neat1 plays a crucial role in \nsuppressing transformation in response to oncogenic signals. Neat1 deficiency \nenhances transformation in oncogene-expressing fibroblasts and promotes the \ndevelopment of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) and \ncystic lesions in KrasG12D-expressing mice. Neat1 loss provokes global changes \nin gene expression, suggesting a mechanism by which its deficiency promotes \nneoplasia. Collectively, these findings identify Neat1 as a p53-regulated large \nintergenic ncRNA (lincRNA) with a key role in suppressing transformation and \ncancer initiation, providing fundamental new insight into p53-mediated tumor \nsuppression.",

            "TEXT": "The AMPK-MFN2 axis regulates MAM dynamics and autophagy induced by energy \nstresses.\n\nEnergy deprivation activates the cellular energy sensor AMP-activated protein \nkinase (AMPK), which in turn induces macroautophagy/autophagy. The \nmitochondrial-associated ER membrane (MAM) plays a key role in mitochondrial \ndivision and autophagy, and the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 (mitofusin 2) \ntethers the MAM, but the mechanism by which AMPK and MFN2 regulate autophagy in \nresponse to energy stress remains unclear. Here, we found that energy stress not \nonly triggers mitochondrial fission and autophagy, but more importantly \nincreases the number of MAMs, a process that requires AMPK. Interestingly, under \nenergy stress, considerable amounts of AMPK translocate from cytosol to the MAM \nand the mitochondrion as mitochondrial fission occurs. Unexpectedly, AMPK \ninteracts directly with MFN2. The autophagic ability of mouse embryonic \nfibroblasts (MEFs) lacking MFN2 (mfn2-/-) is significantly attenuated in \nresponse to energy stress as compared to wild-type MEFs (WT MEFs), while \nre-expression of MFN2 in mfn2-/- cells rescues the autophagy defects of these \ncells. The abundance of MAMs is also greatly reduced in MFN2-deficient cells. \nFunctional experiments show that the oxygen consumption rate and the glycolytic \nfunction of cells lacking MFN2 but not MFN1 are obviously attenuated, and MFN2 \nis important for cell survival under energy stress. In conclusion, our study \nestablishes the molecular link between the energy sensor AMPK and the MAM tether \nMFN2, and reveals the important role of AMPK and MFN2 in energy stress-induced \nautophagy and MAM dynamics.",

            "TEXT": "Adipocyte-Induced FABP4 Expression in Ovarian Cancer Cells Promotes Metastasis \nand Mediates Carboplatin Resistance.\n\nAdipocytes are critical for ovarian cancer cells to home to the omentum, but the \nmetabolic changes initiated by this interaction are unknown. To this end, we \ncarried out unbiased mass spectrometry-based metabolomic and proteomic profiling \nof cancer cells cocultured with primary human omental adipocytes. Cancer cells \nunderwent significant proteo-metabolomic alteration(s), typified by changes in \nthe lipidome with corresponding upregulation of lipid metabolism proteins. \nFABP4, a lipid chaperone protein, was identified as the critical regulator of \nlipid responses in ovarian cancer cells cocultured with adipocytes. \nSubsequently, knockdown of FABP4 resulted in increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine \nlevels in the DNA, downregulation of gene signatures associated with ovarian \ncancer metastasis, and reduced clonogenic cancer cell survival. In addition, \nclustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated \nknockout of FABP4 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells reduced metastatic \ntumor burden in mice. Consequently, a small-molecule inhibitor of FABP4 \n(BMS309403) not only significantly reduced tumor burden in a syngeneic \northotopic mouse model but also increased the sensitivity of cancer cells toward \ncarboplatin both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results show that \ntargeting FABP4 in ovarian cancer cells can inhibit their ability to adapt and \ncolonize lipid-rich tumor microenvironments, providing an opportunity for \nspecific metabolic targeting of ovarian cancer metastasis. SIGNIFICANCE: Ovarian \ncancer metastatic progression can be restricted by targeting a critical \nregulator of lipid responses, FABP4.",

            "TEXT": "AMPK activation does not enhance autophagy in neurons in contrast to MTORC1 \ninhibition: different impact on β-amyloid clearance.\n\nThe physiological AKT-MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways are considered key \nnodes in the regulation of anabolism-catabolism, and particularly of \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Indeed, it is reported that these are altered \nprocesses in neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD), \nmainly characterized by deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated MAPT. \nThese accumulations disrupt the optimal neuronal proteostasis, and hence, the \nrecovery/enhancement of autophagy has been proposed as a therapeutic approach \nagainst these proteinopathies. The purpose of the present study was to \ncharacterize the modulation of autophagy by MTORC1 and AMPK signaling pathways \nin the highly specialized neurons, as well as their repercussions on Aβ \nproduction. Using a double transgenic mice model of AD, we demonstrated that \nMTORC1 inhibition, either in vivo or ex vivo (primary neuronal cultures), was \nable to reduce amyloid secretion through moderate autophagy induction in \nneurons. The pharmacological prevention of autophagy in neurons augmented the Aβ \nsecretion and reversed the effect of rapamycin, confirming the \nanti-amyloidogenic effects of autophagy in neurons. Inhibition of AMPK with \ncompound C generated the expected decrease in autophagy induction, though \nsurprisingly did not increase the Aβ secretion. In contrast, increased activity \nof AMPK with metformin, AICAR, 2DG, or by gene overexpression did not enhance \nautophagy but had different effects on Aβ secretion: whereas metformin and 2DG \ndiminished the secreted Aβ levels, AICAR and PRKAA1/AMPK gene overexpression \nincreased them. We conclude that AMPK has a significantly different role in \nprimary neurons than in other reported cells, lacking a direct effect on \nautophagy-dependent amyloidosis.",

We previously found \nthat EZH2 regulates RNA polymerase III-transcribed 5S ribosomal RNA gene \ntranscription. However, whether EZH2 regulates ribosome synthesis is still \nunknown. Here, we report that EZH2 promotes ribosome synthesis by targeting and \nsilencing a long noncoding RNA PHACTR2-AS1. PHACTR2-AS1 directly bound ribosome \nDNA genes and recruited histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, which in turn \ntriggered H3K9 methylation of these genes. Depletion of PHACTR2-AS1 resulted in \nhyperactivation of ribosome synthesis and instability of ribosomal DNA, which \npromoted cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. Administration of \nPHACTR2-AS1-30nt-RNA, which binds to SUV39H1, effectively inhibited breast \ncancer growth and lung metastasis in mice. PHACTR2-AS1 was downregulated in \nbreast cancer patients, where lower PHACTR2-AS1 expression promoted breast \ncancer development and correlated with poor patient outcome. Taken together, we \ndemonstrate that PHACTR2-AS1 maintains a H3K9 methylation-marked silent state of \nribosomal DNA genes, comprising a regulatory axis that controls breast cancer \ngrowth and metastasis.",

            "TEXT": "RAD51AP1 Deficiency Reduces Tumor Growth by Targeting Stem Cell Self-Renewal.\n\nRAD51-associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) plays an integral role in homologous \nrecombination by activating RAD51 recombinase. Homologous recombination is \nessential for preserving genome integrity and RAD51AP1 is critical for D-loop \nformation, a key step in homologous recombination. Although RAD51AP1 is involved \nin maintaining genomic stability, recent studies have shown that RAD51AP1 \nexpression is significantly upregulated in human cancers. However, the \nfunctional role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and the underlying molecular \nmechanism(s) by which RAD51AP1 regulates tumorigenesis have not been fully \nunderstood. Here, we use Rad51ap1-knockout mice in genetically engineered mouse \nmodels of breast cancer to unravel the role of RAD51AP1 in tumor growth and \nmetastasis. RAD51AP1 gene transcript was increased in both luminal estrogen \nreceptor-positive breast cancer and basal triple-negative breast cancer, which \nis associated with poor prognosis. Conversely, knockdown of RAD51AP1 (RADP51AP1 \nKD) in breast cancer cell lines reduced tumor growth. Rad51ap1-deficient mice \nwere protected from oncogene-driven spontaneous mouse mammary tumor growth and \nassociated lung metastasis. In vivo, limiting dilution studies provided evidence \nthat Rad51ap1 plays a critical role in breast cancer stem cell (BCSC) \nself-renewal. RAD51AP1 KD improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy response by \ninhibiting BCSC self-renewal and associated pluripotency. Overall, our study \nprovides genetic and biochemical evidences that RAD51AP1 is critical for tumor \ngrowth and metastasis by increasing BCSC self-renewal and may serve as a novel \ntarget for chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-resistant breast cancer.",

            "TEXT": "Ubiquitination of UVRAG by SMURF1 promotes autophagosome maturation and inhibits \nhepatocellular carcinoma growth.\n\nUVRAG (UV radiation resistance associated) is an important regulator of \nmammalian macroautophagy/autophagy by interacting with BECN1, PIK3C3, and RUBCN. \nPhosphorylation of UVRAG by MTORC1 negatively regulates autophagosome maturation \nunder nutrient-enriched conditions. However, how UVRAG ubiquitination is \nregulated is still unknown. Here we report that UVRAG is ubiquitinated by SMURF1 \nat lysine residues 517 and 559, which decreases the association of UVRAG with \nRUBCN and promotes autophagosome maturation. However, the deubiquitinase ZRANB1 \nspecifically cleaves SMURF1-induced K29 and K33-linked polyubiquitin chains from \nUVRAG, thereby increasing the binding of UVRAG to RUBCN and inhibiting autophagy \nflux. We also demonstrate that CSNK1A1-mediated UVRAG phosphorylation at Ser522 \ndisrupts the binding of SMURF1 to UVRAG through PPxY motif and blocks UVRAG \nubiquitination-mediated autophagosome maturation. Interestingly, ZRANB1 is \nphosphorylated at Thr35, and Ser209 residues by CSNK1A1, and this \nphosphorylation activates its deubiquitinating activity. Importantly, we provide \nin vitro and in vivo evidence that UVRAG ubiquitination at lysine residues 517 \nand 559 or prevention of Ser522 phosphorylation by D4476, a CSNK1A1 inhibitor, \nenhances the lysosomal degradation of EGFR, which significantly inhibits \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth. Furthermore, UVRAG S522 phosphorylation \nlevels correlate with ZRANB1 T35/S209 phosphorylation levels and poor prognosis \nin HCC patients. These findings identify a novel molecular mechanism by which \nubiquitination and phosphorylation of UVRAG regulate its function in \nautophagosome maturation and HCC growth, encouraging further study of their \npotential therapeutic implications.",

Although recent advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy \nhave brought revolutionary progress of the treatment outcome, the survival of \npatients with advanced melanoma remains unoptimistic, and metastatic melanoma is \nstill an incurable disease. Therefore, to further understand the mechanism \nunderlying melanoma pathogenesis could be helpful for developing novel \ntherapeutic strategy. A20 is a crucial ubiquitin-editing enzyme implicated \nimmunity regulation, inflammatory responses and cancer pathogenesis. Herein, we \nreport that A20 played an oncogenic role in melanoma. We first found that the \nexpression of A20 was significantly up-regulated in melanoma cell lines. Then, \nwe showed that knockdown of A20 suppressed melanoma cell proliferation in vitro \nand melanoma growth in vivo through the regulation of cell-cycle progression. \nMoreover, A20 could potentiate the invasive and migratory capacities of melanoma \ncell in vitro and melanoma metastasis in vivo by promoting \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, we found that Akt \nactivation mediated the oncogenic effect of A20 on melanoma development, with \nthe involvement of glycolysis. What's more, the up-regulation of A20 conferred \nthe acquired resistance to Vemurafenib in BRAF-mutant melanoma.

            "TEXT": "ATG12 deficiency leads to tumor cell oncosis owing to diminished mitochondrial \nbiogenesis and reduced cellular bioenergetics.\n\nIn contrast to the \"Warburg effect\" or aerobic glycolysis earlier generalized as \na phenomenon in cancer cells, more and more recent evidence indicates that \nfunctional mitochondria are pivotal for ensuring the energy supply of cancer \ncells. Here, we report that cancer cells with reduced autophagy-related protein \n12 (ATG12) expression undergo an oncotic cell death, a phenotype distinct from \nthat seen in ATG5-deficient cells described before. In addition, using \nuntargeted metabolomics with ATG12-deficient cancer cells, we observed a global \nreduction in cellular bioenergetic pathways, such as β-oxidation (FAO), \nglycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, as well as a decrease in \nmitochondrial respiration as monitored with Seahorse experiments. Analyzing the \nbiogenesis of mitochondria by quantifying mitochondrial DNA content together \nwith several mitochondrion-localizing proteins indicated a reduction in \nmitochondrial biogenesis in ATG12-deficient cancer cells, which also showed \nreduced hexokinase II expression and the upregulation of uncoupling protein 2. \nATG12, which we observed in normal cells to be partially localized in \nmitochondria, is upregulated in multiple types of solid tumors in comparison \nwith normal tissues. Strikingly, mouse xenografts of ATG12-deficient cells grew \nsignificantly slower as compared with vector control cells. Collectively, our \nwork has revealed a previously unreported role for ATG12 in regulating \nmitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy metabolism and points up an \nessential role for mitochondria as a failsafe mechanism in the growth and \nsurvival of glycolysis-dependent cancer cells. Inducing oncosis by imposing an \nATG12 deficiency in solid tumors might represent an anticancer therapy \npreferable to conventional caspase-dependent apoptosis that often leads to \nundesirable consequences, such as incomplete cancer cell killing and a silencing \nof the host immune system.",

            "TEXT": "BAX-dependent mitochondrial pathway mediates the crosstalk between ferroptosis \nand apoptosis.\n\nFerroptosis is considered a distinctive form of cell death compared to other \ntypes of death such as apoptosis. It is known to result from iron-dependent \naccumulation of lipid peroxides rather than caspase activation. However, we \nreported recently that ferroptosis interplays with apoptosis. In this study, we \ninvestigated a possible mechanism of this interplay between ferroptosis and \napoptosis. Results from our studies reveal that combined treatment of the \nferroptotic agent erastin and the apoptotic agent TRAIL effectively disrupted \nmitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and subsequently promoted caspase \nactivation. The alterations of mitochondrial membrane potential are probably due \nto an increase in oligomerization of BAX and its accumulation at the \nmitochondria during treatment with erastin and TRAIL. Interestingly, the \ncombined treatment-promoted apoptosis was effectively inhibited in BAX-deficient \nHCT116 cells, but not BAK-deficient cells. These results indicate that the \nBAX-associated mitochondria-dependent pathway plays a pivotal role in \nerastin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "CSF1R signaling is a regulator of pathogenesis in progressive MS.\n\nMicroglia serve as the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) \nby providing continuous surveillance of the CNS microenvironment and initiating \ndefense mechanisms to protect CNS tissue. Upon injury, microglia transition into \nan activated state altering their transcriptional profile, transforming their \nmorphology, and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines. These activated microglia \ninitially serve a beneficial role, but their continued activation drives \nneuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, \ninflammatory, demyelinating disease of the CNS, and activated microglia and \nmacrophages play a significant role in mediating disease pathophysiology and \nprogression. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and its ligand CSF1 \nare elevated in CNS tissue derived from MS patients. We performed a large-scale \nRNA-sequencing experiment and identified CSF1R as a key node of disease \nprogression in a mouse model of progressive MS. We hypothesized that modulating \nmicroglia and infiltrating macrophages through the inhibition of CSF1R will \nattenuate deleterious CNS inflammation and reduce subsequent demyelination and \nneurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel potent and \nselective small-molecule CSF1R inhibitor (sCSF1Rinh) for preclinical testing. \nsCSF1Rinh blocked receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling in both \nmicroglia and macrophages and altered cellular functions including \nproliferation, survival, and cytokine production. In vivo, CSF1R inhibition with \nsCSF1Rinh attenuated neuroinflammation and reduced microglial proliferation in a \nmurine acute LPS model. Furthermore, the sCSF1Rinh attenuated a \ndisease-associated microglial phenotype and blocked both axonal damage and \nneurological impairments in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) \nmodel of MS. While previous studies have focused on microglial depletion \nfollowing CSF1R inhibition, our data clearly show that signaling downstream of \nthis receptor can be beneficially modulated in the context of CNS injury. \nTogether, these data suggest that CSF1R inhibition can reduce deleterious \nmicroglial proliferation and modulate microglial phenotypes during \nneuroinflammatory pathogenesis, particularly in progressive MS.",

MPM diagnosis is late and often \nchallenging, suggesting the need to identify more reliable molecular biomarkers. \nHere, we set out to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in epithelioid, \nbiphasic, and sarcomatoid MPMs versus normal mesothelium and explored specific \nmiRNA contribution to mesothelial tumorigenesis. We screened an LNA™-based \nmiRNA-microrray with 14 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) MPMs and 6 \nnormal controls. Through real-time qRT-PCR we extended the analysis of a miRNA \nsubset and further investigated miR-320a role through state-of-the-art \ntechniques. We identified 16 upregulated and 32 downregulated miRNAs in MPMs \nversus normal tissue, including the previously identified potential biomarkers \nmiR-21, miR-126, miR-143, miR-145. We showed in an extended series that miR-145, \nmiR-10b, and miR-320a levels can discriminate tumor versus controls with high \nspecificity and sensitivity. We focused on miR-320a because other family members \nwere found downregulated in MPMs. However, stable miR-320a ectopic expression \ninduced higher proliferation and migration ability, whereas miR-320a silencing \nreduced these processes, not supporting a classic tumor-suppressor role in MPM \ncell lines. Among putative targets, we found that miR-320a binds the 3'-UTR of \nthe immune inhibitory receptor ligand PDL1 and, consistently, miR-320a \nmodulation affects PDL1 levels in MPM cells. Finally, we showed that p53 \nover-expression induces the upregulation of miR-320a, along with miR-200a and \nmiR-34a, both known to target PDL1, and reduces PDL1 levels in MPM cells. Our \ndata suggest that PDL1 expression might be due to a defective p53-regulated \nmiRNA response, which could contribute to MPM immune evasion or tumorigenesis \nthrough tumor-intrinsic roles.",

            "TEXT": "USP10 Promotes Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Deubiquitinating and \nStabilizing YAP/TAZ.\n\nYes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog, transcriptional coactivator with \nPDZ-binding motif (TAZ), play pivotal roles in promoting the progression of \nhepatocellular carcinoma. However, the regulatory mechanism underpinning \naberrant activation of YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma remains unclear. In \nthis study, we globally profiled the contribution of deubiquitinating enzymes \n(DUB) to both transcriptional activity and protein abundance of YAP/TAZ in \nhepatocellular carcinoma models and identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 \n(USP10) as a potent YAP/TAZ-activating DUB. Mechanistically, USP10 directly \ninteracted with and stabilized YAP/TAZ by reverting their proteolytic \nubiquitination. Depletion of USP10 enhanced polyubiquitination of YAP/TAZ, \npromoted their proteasomal degradation, and ultimately arrested the \nproliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Expression \nlevels of USP10 positively correlated with the abundance of YAP/TAZ in \nhepatocellular carcinoma patient samples as well as in N-nitrosodiethylamine \n(DEN)-induced liver cancer mice models. Collectively, this study establishes the \ncausal link between USP10 and hyperactivated YAP/TAZ in hepatocellular carcinoma \ncells and provides a rationale for potential therapeutic interventions in the \ntreatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma harboring a high level of \nYAP/TAZ. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify USP10 as a DUB of YAP/TAZ and its \nrole in hepatocellular carcinoma progression, which may serve as a potential \ntherapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.",

            "TEXT": "METTL3 and ALKBH5 oppositely regulate m(6)A modification of TFEB mRNA, which \ndictates the fate of hypoxia/reoxygenation-treated cardiomyocytes.\n\nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA modifications play critical roles in various \nbiological processes. However, no study addresses the role of m6A in \nmacroautophagy/autophagy. Here, we show that m6A modifications are increased in \nH/R-treated cardiomyocytes and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-treated mice heart. We \nfound that METTL3 (methyltransferase like 3) is the primary factor involved in \naberrant m6A modification. Silencing METTL3 enhances autophagic flux and \ninhibits apoptosis in H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. However, overexpression of \nMETTL3 or inhibition of the RNA demethylase ALKBH5 has an opposite effect, \nsuggesting that METTL3 is a negative regulator of autophagy. Mechanistically, \nMETTL3 methylates TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy \ngenes, at two m6A residues in the 3'-UTR, which promotes the association of the \nRNA-binding protein HNRNPD with TFEB pre-mRNA and subsequently decreases the \nexpression levels of TFEB. Further experiments show that autophagic flux \nenhanced by METTL3 deficiency is TFEB dependent. In turn, TFEB regulates the \nexpression levels of METTL3 and ALKBH5 in opposite directions: it induces ALKBH5 \nand inhibits METTL3. TFEB binds to the ALKBH5 promoter and activates its \ntranscription. In contrast, inhibition of METTL3 by TFEB does not involve \ntranscriptional repression but rather downregulation of mRNA stability, thereby \nestablishing a negative feedback loop. Together, our work uncovers a critical \nlink between METTL3-ALKBH5 and autophagy, providing insight into the functional \nimportance of the reversible mRNA m6A methylation and its modulators in ischemic \nheart disease.",

The altered balance between pro- and \nantiapoptosis signals within cancer cells is critical to therapeutic resistance. \nHowever, the molecular mechanisms underlying increased antiapoptosis signals \nremain poorly understood. In this study, we report that PRMT1 expression is \nincreased in pancreatic cancer tissues and is associated with higher tumor \ngrade, increased aggressiveness, and worse prognosis. PRMT1 overexpression \nincreased arginine methylation of HSPs of 70 kDa (HSP70); this methylation \nenhanced HSP70 binding and stabilization of BCL2 mRNA through AU-rich elements \nin 3'-untranslated region and consequentially increased BCL2 protein expression \nand protected cancer cells from apoptosis induced by cellular stresses and \ntherapeutics. RNA binding and regulation function of HSP70 was involved in \npancreatic cancer drug resistance and was dependent on protein arginine \nmethylation. These findings not only reveal a novel PRMT1-HSP70-BCL2 signaling \naxis that is crucial to pancreatic cancer cell survival and therapeutic \nresistance, but they also provide a proof of concept that targeted inhibition of \nthis axis may represent a new therapeutic strategy.",

Histone \nmethyltransferase KMT2D (a COMPASS-like enzyme, also called MLL4) is among the \nmost highly inactivated epigenetic modifiers in lung cancer. Here, we show that \nlung-specific loss of Kmt2d promotes lung tumorigenesis in mice and upregulates \npro-tumorigenic programs, including glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of \nglycolysis preferentially impedes tumorigenicity of human lung cancer cells \nbearing KMT2D-inactivating mutations. Mechanistically, Kmt2d loss widely impairs \nepigenomic signals for super-enhancers/enhancers, including the super-enhancer \nfor the circadian rhythm repressor Per2. Loss of Kmt2d decreases expression of \nPER2, which regulates multiple glycolytic genes. These findings indicate that \nKMT2D is a lung tumor suppressor and that KMT2D deficiency confers a therapeutic \nvulnerability to glycolytic inhibitors.",

            "TEXT": "PSF Promotes ER-Positive Breast Cancer Progression via Posttranscriptional \nRegulation of ESR1 and SCFD2.\n\n\nEndocrine therapy is standard treatment for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive \nbreast cancer, yet long-term treatment often causes acquired resistance, which \nresults in recurrence and metastasis. Recent studies have revealed that \nRNA-binding proteins (RBP) are involved in tumorigenesis. Here, we demonstrate \nthat PSF/SFPQ is an RBP that potentially predicts poor prognosis of patients \nwith ER-positive breast cancer by posttranscriptionally regulating ERα (ESR1) \nmRNA expression. Strong PSF immunoreactivity correlated with shorter overall \nsurvival in patients with ER-positive breast cancer. PSF was predominantly \nexpressed in a model of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells, and depletion \nof PSF attenuated proliferation of cultured cells and xenografted tumors. PSF \nexpression was significantly associated with estrogen signaling. PSF siRNA \ndownregulated ESR1 mRNA by inhibiting nuclear export of the RNA. Integrative \nanalyses of microarray and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing also identified \nSCFD2, TRA2B, and ASPM as targets of PSF. Among the PSF targets, SCFD2 was a \npoor prognostic indicator of breast cancer and SCFD2 knockdown significantly \nsuppressed breast cancer cell proliferation. Collectively, this study shows that \nPSF plays a pathophysiologic role in ER-positive breast cancer by \nposttranscriptionally regulating expression of its target genes such as ESR1 and \nSCFD2. Overall, PSF and SCFD2 could be potential diagnostic and therapeutic \ntargets for primary and hormone-refractory breast cancers.",

            "TEXT": "MTORC1 coordinates the autophagy and apoptosis signaling in articular \nchondrocytes in osteoarthritic temporomandibular joint.\n\nA switch from autophagy to apoptosis is implicated in chondrocytes during the \nosteoarthritis (OA) progression with currently unknown mechanism(s). In this \nstudy we utilized a flow fluid shear stress (FFSS) model in cultured \nchondrocytes and a unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) animal model. We found \nthat both FFSS and UAC actively induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in \nthe temporomandibular joints (TMJ) chondrocytes, as demonstrated by dramatic \nincreases in expression of HSPA5, p-EIF2AK3, p-ERN1 and ATF6. Interestingly, \nboth FFSS and UAC activated not only pro-death p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS-apoptosis \nprograms but also pro-survival p-ERN1-mediated autophagic flux in chondrocytes. \nData from FFSS demonstrated that MTORC1, a downstream of p-ERN1, suppressed \nautophagy but promoted p-EIF2AK3 mediated ERS-apoptosis. Data from UAC model \ndemonstrated that at early stage both the p-ERN1 and p-EIF2AK3 were activated \nand MTORC1 was inhibited in TMJ chondrocytes. At late stage, \nMTORC1-p-EIF2AK3-mediated ERS apoptosis were predominant, while p-ERN1 and \nautophagic flux were inhibited. Inhibition of MTORC1 by TMJ local injection of \nrapamycin in rats or inducible ablation of MTORC1 expression selectively in \nchondrocytes in mice promoted chondrocyte autophagy and suppressed apoptosis, \nand reduced TMJ cartilage loss induced by UAC. In contrast, MTORC1 activation by \nTMJ local administration of MHY1485 or genetic deletion of Tsc1, an upstream \nMTORC1 suppressor, resulted in opposite effects. Collectively, our results \nestablish that aberrant mechanical loading causes cartilage degeneration by \nactivating, at least in part, the MTORC1 signaling which modulates the autophagy \nand apoptosis programs in TMJ chondrocytes. Thus, inhibition of MTORC1 provides \na novel therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of OA.",

The transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligases ZNRF3 (zinc \nand ring finger 3) and RNF43 (ring finger protein 43) antagonize Wnt signaling \nby promoting degradation of frizzled receptors. ZNRF3 and RNF43 are frequently \ninactivated in human cancer, but the molecular and therapeutic implications \nremain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adrenocortical-specific loss of ZNRF3, \nbut not RNF43, results in adrenal hyperplasia that depends on Porcupine-mediated \nWnt ligand secretion. Furthermore, we discovered a Wnt/β-catenin signaling \ngradient in the adrenal cortex that is disrupted upon loss of ZNRF3. Unlike \nβ-catenin gain-of-function models, which induce high Wnt/β-catenin activation \nand expansion of the peripheral cortex, ZNRF3 loss triggers activation of \nmoderate-level Wnt/β-catenin signaling that drives proliferative expansion of \nonly the histologically and functionally distinct inner cortex. Genetically \nreducing β-catenin dosage significantly reverses the ZNRF3-deficient phenotype. \nThus, homeostatic maintenance of the adrenal cortex is dependent on varying \nlevels of Wnt/β-catenin activation, which is regulated by ZNRF3.",

Here, we identified endothelial TGF-β-activated \nkinase 1 (TAK1) as a critical regulator of endothelial necroptosis and \nmetastasis. Human and murine endothelial cells lacking TAK1 exhibit higher \nlevels of necroptosis both in vitro and in vivo, and mice with endothelial \ncell-specific loss of TAK1 are more prone to form metastases. Endothelial RIPK3, \na key component of the necroptotic machinery, was upregulated in mice with \nendothelial TAK1-deficiency, and endothelial knockout of RIPK3 reverted the \neffects of TAK1-deficiency. Moreover, altered expression levels of TAK1 and \nRIPK3 in pulmonary endothelial cells of mice bearing primary tumors correlated \nwith increased endothelial necroptosis and metastasis. Together, our data \nsuggest an important protective role for endothelial TAK1 in tumor progression \nby keeping endothelial necroptosis in check.",

            "TEXT": "Tumor Cell-Derived Angiopoietin-2 Promotes Metastasis in Melanoma.\n\nThe angiopoietin (Angpt)-TIE signaling pathway controls vascular maturation and \nmaintains the quiescent phenotype of resting vasculature. The contextual \nagonistic and antagonistic Tie2 ligand ANGPT2 is believed to be exclusively \nproduced by endothelial cells, disrupting constitutive ANGPT1-TIE2 signaling to \ndestabilize the microvasculature during pathologic disorders like inflammation \nand cancer. However, scattered reports have also portrayed tumor cells as a \nsource of ANGPT2. Employing ISH-based detection of ANGPT2, we found strong tumor \ncell expression of ANGPT2 in a subset of patients with melanoma. Comparative \nanalysis of biopsies revealed a higher fraction of ANGPT2-expressing tumor cells \nin metastatic versus primary sites. Tumor cell-expressed Angpt2 was dispensable \nfor primary tumor growth, yet in-depth analysis of primary tumors revealed \nenhanced intratumoral necrosis upon silencing of tumor cell Angpt2 expression in \nthe absence of significant immune and vascular alterations. Global \ntranscriptional profiling of Angpt2-deficient tumor cells identified \nperturbations in redox homeostasis and an increased response to cellular \noxidative stress. Ultrastructural analyses illustrated a significant increase of \ndysfunctional mitochondria in Angpt2-silenced tumor cells, thereby resulting in \nenhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and downstream MAPK stress \nsignaling. Functionally, enhanced ROS in Angpt2-silenced tumor cells reduced \ncolonization potential in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these findings \nuncover the hitherto unappreciated role of tumor cell-expressed ANGPT2 as an \nautocrine-positive regulator of metastatic colonization and validate ANGPT2 as a \ntherapeutic target for a well-defined subset of patients with melanoma. \nSIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that tumor cells can be a source of ANGPT2 in \nthe tumor microenvironment and that tumor cell-derived ANGPT2 augments \nmetastatic colonization by protecting tumor cells from oxidative stress.",

            "TEXT": "Acyl-CoA thioesterase 1 prevents cardiomyocytes from Doxorubicin-induced \nferroptosis via shaping the lipid composition.\n\nIn this study, we first established the doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) \nmodel with C57BL/6 mice and confirmed cardiac dysfunction with transthoracic \nechocardiography examination. RNA-sequencing was then performed to explore the \npotential mechanisms and transcriptional changes in the process. The metabolic \npathway, biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid was significantly altered in \nDOX-treated murine heart, and Acot1 was one of the leading-edge core genes. We \nthen investigated the role of Acot1 to ferroptosis that was reported recently to \nbe related to DIC. The induction of ferroptosis in the DOX-treated heart was \nconfirmed by transmission electron microscopy, and the inhibition of ferroptosis \nusing Fer-1 effectively prevented the cardiac injury as well as the \nultrastructure changes of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial. Both in vitro and in vivo \nexperiments proved the downregulation of Acot1 in DIC, which can be partially \nprevented with Fer-1 treatment. Overexpression of Acot1 in cell lines showed \nnoteworthy protection to ferroptosis, while the knock-down of Acot1 sensitized \ncardiomyocytes to ferroptosis by DIC. Finally, the heart tissue of αMHC-Acot1 \ntransgenic mice presented altered free fatty acid composition, indicating that \nthe benefit of Acot1 in the inhibition of ferroptosis lies biochemically and \nrelates to its enzymatic function in lipid metabolism in DIC. The current study \nhighlights the importance of ferroptosis in DIC and points out the potential \nprotective role of Acot1 in the process. The beneficial role of Acot1 may be \nrelated to its biochemical function by shaping the lipid composition. In all, \nAcot1 may become a potential treating target in preventing DIC by \nanti-ferroptosis.",

            "TEXT": "Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Is Not Essential for K-Ras-Driven Tumor Growth \nor Metastasis.\n\nThe enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a major contributor to \nNADPH production and redox homeostasis and its expression is upregulated and \ncorrelated with negative patient outcomes in multiple human cancer types. \nDespite these associations, whether G6PD is essential for tumor initiation, \ngrowth, or metastasis remains unclear. Here, we employ modern genetic tools to \nevaluate the role of G6PD in lung, breast, and colon cancer driven by oncogenic \nK-Ras. Human HCT116 colorectal cancer cells lacking G6PD exhibited metabolic \nindicators of oxidative stress, but developed into subcutaneous xenografts with \ngrowth comparable with that of wild-type controls. In a genetically engineered \nmouse model of non-small cell lung cancer driven by K-Ras G12D and p53 \ndeficiency, G6PD knockout did not block formation or proliferation of primary \nlung tumors. In MDA-MB-231-derived human triple-negative breast cancer cells \nimplanted as orthotopic xenografts, loss of G6PD modestly decreased primary site \ngrowth without ablating spontaneous metastasis to the lung and moderately \nimpaired the ability of breast cancer cells to colonize the lung when delivered \nvia tail vein injection. Thus, in the studied K-Ras tumor models, G6PD was not \nstrictly essential for tumorigenesis and at most modestly promoted disease \nprogression. SIGNIFICANCE: K-Ras-driven tumors can grow and metastasize even in \nthe absence of the oxidative pentose pathway, a main NADPH production route.",

In SH-SY5Y cells and primary murine neurons, we report that OGD/R \ninduces the accumulation of the microRNA miR-422a, leading to downregulation of \nmiR-422a targets myocyte enhancer factor-2D (MEF2D) and mitogen-activated \nprotein kinase kinase 6 (MAPKK6). Ectopic miR-422a inhibition attenuated \nOGD/R-induced cell death and apoptosis, whereas overexpression of miR-422a \ninduced significant neuronal cell apoptosis. In addition, OGD/R decreased the \nexpression of the long non-coding RNA D63785 (Lnc-D63785) to regulate miR-422a \naccumulation. Lnc-D63785 directly associated with miR-422a and overexpression of \nLnc-D63785 reversed OGD/R-induced miR-422a accumulation and neuronal cell death. \nOGD/R downregulated Lnc-D63785 expression through increased \nmethyltransferase-like protein 3 (METTL3)-dependent Lnc-D63785 m6A methylation. \nConversely METTL3 shRNA reversed OGD/R-induced Lnc-D63785 m6A methylation to \ndecrease miR-422a accumulation. Together, Lnc-D63785 m6A methylation by OGD/R \ncauses miR-422a accumulation and neuronal cell apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "Drosophila jumu modulates apoptosis via a JNK-dependent pathway and is required \nfor other processes in wing development.\n\nPrevious studies in several model organisms have revealed that members of the \nForkhead (Fkh) transcription factor family have multiple functions. Drosophila \nJumeau (Jumu), a member of this family, participates in cardiogenesis, \nhematopoiesis and immune system homeostasis. Here, we show that loss of jumu \nfunction positively regulates or triggers apoptosis via a JNK-dependent pathway \nin wing development. jumu mutants showed reduced wing size and increased \napoptosis. Moreover, we observed a loss of the anterior cross vein (ACV) \nphenotype that was similar to that observed in wings in which JNK signaling has \nbeen ectopically activated. The JNK signaling markers puckered (puc) and p-JNK \nwere also significantly increased in the wing discs of jumu mutants. In \naddition, apoptosis induced by the loss of jumu was rescued by knocking down \nJNK, indicating a role for JNK in reducing jumu-induced apoptosis. Jumu could \nalso control wing margin development via the positive regulation of cut \nexpression, and the observed wing margin defect did not result from a loss of \njumu-induced apoptosis. Further, jumu deficiency in the pupal wing could induce \nmultiple wing hairs via a Rho1-mediated planar cell polarity pathway, but \nabnormal Rho1 expression was not why jumu loss induced apoptosis via a \nJNK-dependent pathway in wing discs.",

Since MTOR is known to \ngenerally suppress autophagy, the apparently independent regulation of these two \nkey pathways of glomerular maintenance remained puzzling. We now report that \nlong-term genetic manipulation of MTOR activity does in fact not influence high \nbasal levels of autophagy in podocytes either in vitro or in vivo. Instead we \npresent data showing that autophagy in podocytes is mainly controlled by \nAMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and ULK1 (unc-51 like kinase 1). \nPharmacological inhibition of MTOR further shows that the uncoupling of MTOR \nactivity and autophagy is time dependent. Together, our data reveal a novel and \nunexpected cell-specific mechanism, which permits concurrent MTOR activity as \nwell as high basal autophagy rates in podocytes. Thus, these data indicate \nmanipulation of the AMPK-ULK1 axis rather than inhibition of MTOR as a promising \ntherapeutic intervention to enhance autophagy and preserve podocyte homeostasis \nin glomerular diseases.",

We discovered upregulation of receptor-interacting \nserine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIP1) in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) \nin PDA. To study its role in oncogenic progression, we developed a selective \nsmall-molecule RIP1 inhibitor with high in vivo exposure. Targeting RIP1 \nreprogrammed TAMs toward an MHCIIhiTNFα+IFNγ+ immunogenic phenotype in a \nSTAT1-dependent manner. RIP1 inhibition in TAMs resulted in cytotoxic T cell \nactivation and T helper cell differentiation toward a mixed Th1/Th17 phenotype, \nleading to tumor immunity in mice and in organotypic models of human PDA. \nTargeting RIP1 synergized with PD1-and inducible co-stimulator-based \nimmunotherapies. Tumor-promoting effects of RIP1 were independent of its \nco-association with RIP3. Collectively, our work describes RIP1 as a checkpoint \nkinase governing tumor immunity.",

            "TEXT": "Urolithin A suppresses high glucose-induced neuronal amyloidogenesis by \nmodulating TGM2-dependent ER-mitochondria contacts and calcium homeostasis.\n\nHyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients is a causative factor for \namyloidogenesis and induces neuropathological changes, such as impaired neuronal \nintegrity, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment. Regulation of \nmitochondrial calcium influx from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is considered a \npromising strategy for the prevention of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) accumulation \nthat occurs in the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathogenesis in DM \npatients. Among the metabolites of ellagitannins that are produced in the gut \nmicrobiome, urolithin A has received an increasing amount of attention as a \nnovel candidate with anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects in AD. Here, we \ninvestigated the effect of urolithin A on high glucose-induced amyloidogenesis \ncaused by mitochondrial calcium dysregulation and mtROS accumulation resulting \nin neuronal degeneration. We also identified the mechanism related to \nmitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) formation. We found that urolithin \nA-lowered mitochondrial calcium influx significantly alleviated high \nglucose-induced mtROS accumulation and expression of amyloid beta (Aβ)-producing \nenzymes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase-1 (BACE1), as \nwell as Aβ production. Urolithin A injections in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced \ndiabetic mouse model alleviated APP and BACE1 expressions, Tau phosphorylation, \nAβ deposition, and cognitive impairment. In addition, high glucose stimulated \nMAM formation and transglutaminase type 2 (TGM2) expression. We first discovered \nthat urolithin A significantly reduced high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. In \naddition, disruption of the AIP-AhR complex was involved in urolithin A-mediated \nsuppression of high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. Markedly, TGM2 silencing \ninhibited inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor type \n1 (IP3R1)-voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) \ninteractions and prevented high glucose-induced mitochondrial calcium influx and \nmtROS accumulation. We also found that urolithin A or TGM2 silencing prevented \nAβ-induced mitochondrial calcium influx, mtROS accumulation, Tau \nphosphorylation, and cell death in neuronal cells. In conclusion, we suggest \nthat urolithin A is a promising candidate for the development of therapies to \nprevent DM-associated AD pathogenesis by reducing TGM2-dependent MAM formation \nand maintaining mitochondrial calcium and ROS homeostasis.",

Here we elucidate a MYC-miRNA-MXI1 feedback loop that \nregulates proliferation and tumorigenesis in glioma. MYC suppressed MXI1 \nexpression via microRNA-155 (miR-155) and the microRNA-23a∼27a∼24-2 cluster \n(miR-23a cluster), whereas MXI1, in turn, inhibited MYC expression by binding to \nits promoter. Overexpression of miR-155 and the miR-23a cluster promoted \ntumorigenesis in U87 glioma cells. Furthermore, fat mass and obesity-associated \nprotein (FTO), an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA demethylase, regulated the loop \nby targeting MYC. The ethyl ester form of meclofenamic acid (MA2) inhibited FTO \nand enhanced the effect of the chemotherapy drug temozolomide on suppressing \nproliferation of glioma cells and negatively regulated the loop.

TNF-TNFR1 \ntriggered signaling complex formation, subsequent NF-κB and MAPK activation and \ninduction of cell death involve RIPK1 ubiquitination at several lysine residues \nincluding Lys376 and Lys115. Here we show that mutating the ubiquitination site \nK376 of RIPK1 (K376R) in mice activates cell death resulting in embryonic \nlethality. In contrast to Ripk1K376R/K376R mice, Ripk1K115R/K115R mice reached \nadulthood and showed slightly higher responsiveness to TNF-induced death. Cell \ndeath observed in Ripk1K376R/K376R embryos relied on RIPK1 kinase activity as \nadministration of RIPK1 inhibitor GNE684 to pregnant heterozygous mice \neffectively blocked cell death and prolonged survival. Embryonic lethality of \nRipk1K376R/K376R mice was prevented by the loss of TNFR1, or by simultaneous \ndeletion of caspase-8 and RIPK3. Interestingly, elimination of the wild-type \nallele from adult Ripk1K376R/cko mice was tolerated. However, adult \nRipk1K376R/cko mice were exquisitely sensitive to TNF-induced hypothermia and \nassociated lethality. Absence of the K376 ubiquitination site diminished \nK11-linked, K63-linked, and linear ubiquitination of RIPK1, and promoted the \nassembly of death-inducing cellular complexes, suggesting that multiple \nubiquitin linkages contribute to the stability of the RIPK1 signaling complex \nthat stimulates NF-κB and MAPK activation. In contrast, mutating K115 did not \naffect RIPK1 ubiquitination or TNF stimulated NF-κB and MAPK signaling. Overall, \nour data indicate that selective impairment of RIPK1 ubiquitination can lower \nthe threshold for RIPK1 activation by TNF resulting in cell death and embryonic \nlethality.",

            "TEXT": "A fine-tuning mechanism underlying self-control for autophagy: deSUMOylation of \nBECN1 by SENP3.\n\nThe roles of SUMOylation and the related enzymes in autophagic regulation are \nunclear. Based on our previous studies that identified the SUMO2/3-specific \npeptidase SENP3 as an oxidative stress-responsive molecule, we investigated the \ncorrelation between SUMOylation and macroautophagy/autophagy. We found that \nSenp3± mice showed increased autophagy in the liver under basal and fasting \nconditions, compared to Senp3+/+ mice. We constructed a liver-specific senp3 \nknockout mouse; these Senp3-deficient liver tissues showed increased autophagy \nas well. Autophagic flux was accelerated in hepatic and other cell lines \nfollowing knockdown of SENP3, both before and after the cells underwent \nstarvation in the form of the serum and amino acid deprivation. We demonstrated \nthat BECN1/beclin 1, the core molecule of the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex, could be \nSUMO3-conjugated by PIAS3 predominantly at K380 and deSUMOylated by SENP3. The \nbasal SUMOylation of BECN1 was increased upon cellular starvation, which \nenhanced autophagosome formation by facilitating BECN1 interaction with other \ncomplex components UVRAG, PIK3C3 and ATG14, thus promoting PIK3C3 activity. In \ncontrast, SENP3 deSUMOylated BECN1, which impaired BECN1-PIK3C3 complex \nformation or stability to suppress the PIK3C3 activity. DeSUMOylation of BECN1 \nrestrained autophagy induction under basal conditions and especially upon \nstarvation when SENP3 had accumulated in response to the increased generation of \nreactive oxygen species. Thus, while reversible SUMOylation regulated the degree \nof autophagy, SENP3 provided an intrinsic overflow valve for fine-tuning \nautophagy induction.",

We hypothesized that modulating \nmicroglia and infiltrating macrophages through the inhibition of CSF1R will \nattenuate deleterious CNS inflammation and reduce subsequent demyelination and \nneurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we generated a novel potent and \nselective small-molecule CSF1R inhibitor (sCSF1Rinh) for preclinical testing. \nsCSF1Rinh blocked receptor phosphorylation and downstream signaling in both \nmicroglia and macrophages and altered cellular functions including \nproliferation, survival, and cytokine production. In vivo, CSF1R inhibition with \nsCSF1Rinh attenuated neuroinflammation and reduced microglial proliferation in a \nmurine acute LPS model. Furthermore, the sCSF1Rinh attenuated a \ndisease-associated microglial phenotype and blocked both axonal damage and \nneurological impairments in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) \nmodel of MS. While previous studies have focused on microglial depletion \nfollowing CSF1R inhibition, our data clearly show that signaling downstream of \nthis receptor can be beneficially modulated in the context of CNS injury. \nTogether, these data suggest that CSF1R inhibition can reduce deleterious \nmicroglial proliferation and modulate microglial phenotypes during \nneuroinflammatory pathogenesis, particularly in progressive MS.",

The aim of this study \nwas to investigate roles of SKIL in tumorigenesis and immune escape of \nnon-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SKIL expression levels in NSCLC cell line, \nclinical sample, and adjacent normal tissue were measured by quantitative PCR, \nwestern blot, or immunohistochemistry.

Malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells \nwere evaluated by colony formation, transwell, and MTT assays, and in xenograft \nmice model. Syngeneic mice model and flow cytometry were used to evaluate T cell \ninfiltration. Quantitative PCR and western blot were applied to evaluate \nrelevant mRNA and protein levels, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation was \napplied to unveil the interaction between SKIL and TAZ. SKIL expression was \nhigher in NSCLC tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Silencing of SKIL \ninhibited malignant phenotypes of NSCLC cells and promoted T cell infiltration. \nSKIL-knockdown inhibited autophagy and activated the STING pathway in NSCLC \ncells through down-regulation of TAZ. Silencing of TAZ cancelled the effects of \nSKIL overexpression on malignant phenotypes and autophagy of NSCLC cells. \nInhibition of autophagy reversed the effects of SKIL/TAZ overexpression on the \nSTING pathway. In conclusion, SKIL promoted tumorigenesis and immune escape of \nNSCLC cells through upregulation of TAZ/autophagy axis and inhibition on \ndownstream STING pathway.",

            "TEXT": "Effects of annexin A7 inhibitor-ABO on the expression and distribution of long \nnoncoding RNA-CERNA1 in vascular endothelial cells apoptosis.\n\nMore and more studies reported that diverse biological roles of long noncoding \nRNAs were usually dependent on their subcellular location. In our previous \nstudy, long noncoding RNA CERNA1 was identified both located in cytoplasm and \nnucleus of vascular endothelial cells (VECs). And CERNA1 in cytoplasm, which \nfunctioned as competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA), alleviated the apoptosis of \nVECs. However, the function of CERNA1 in nucleus was still unclear. In this \nstudy, we found that nuclear CERNA1 positively regulated BCL2L10, which \naccelerated the serum and FGF-2 starvation-induced apoptosis of VECs, by \nenhancing the histone modification level of H3K9ac and H3K4me3 in BCL2L10 \npromoter region. Furthermore, due to the paradoxical function, we investigated \nthe variation of CERNA1 subcellular location in VECs. The results showed that, \nas the change of apoptosis status, CERNA1 altered the cellular distribution in \nVECs. And the annexin A7 inhibitor, ABO \n(6-amino-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxymethyl-1,4-benzoxazine), not only increased the \nexpression of CERNA1 by TIA-1, but also specifically improved its cytoplasm \ndistribution proportion so as to inhibit the apoptosis of VECs. This evidence \nsuggested that the subcellular location of CERNA1 played an important role in \nthe VECs apoptosis and ABO might be a potential chemical molecule for therapy of \nVECs apoptosis related cardiovascular diseases.",

            "TEXT": "The pro-apoptotic ARTS protein induces neutrophil apoptosis, efferocytosis, and \nmacrophage reprogramming to promote resolution of inflammation.\n\nARTS (Sept4_i2) is a pro-apoptotic protein and a product of the Sept4 gene. ARTS \nacts upstream of mitochondria to initiate caspase activation. ARTS induces \napoptosis by specifically binding XIAP and allowing de-repression of active \ncaspases required for Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilzation (MOMP). \nMoreover, ARTS promotes apoptosis by inducing ubiquitin-mediated degradation of \nboth major anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP and Bcl-2. In the resolution phase of \ninflammation, the infiltrating leukocytes, which execute the acute innate \nresponse, undergo apoptosis and are subsequently cleared by phagocytic \nmacrophages (i.e. efferocytosis). In this course, macrophages undergo \nreprogramming from inflammatory, to anti-inflammatory, and eventually to \nresolving macrophages that leave the injury sites. Since engulfment of apoptotic \nleukocytes is a key signaling step in macrophage reprogramming and resolution of \ninflammation, we hypothesized that a failed apoptosis in leukocytes in vivo \nwould result in an impaired resolution process. To test this hypothesis, we \nutilized the Sept4/ARTS-/- mice, which exhibit resistance to apoptosis in many \ncell types. During zymosan A-induced peritonitis, Sept4/ARTS-/- mice exhibited \nimpaired resolution of inflammation, characterized by reduced neutrophil \napoptosis, macrophage efferocytosis and expression of pro-resolving mediators. \nThis was associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced \nanti-inflammatory cytokines, secreted by resolution-phase macrophages. Moreover, \nARTS overexpression in leukocytes in vitro promoted an anti-inflammatory \nbehavior. Overall, our results suggest that ARTS is a key master-regulator \nnecessary for neutrophil apoptosis, macrophage efferocytosis and reprogramming \nto the pro-resolving phenotype during the resolution of inflammation.",

Functional \ncharacterization indicated that CPAP overexpression increases tumor growth, \nangiogenesis, and metastasis ex vivo and in vivo. In addition, overexpressed \nCPAP contributes to sorafenib resistance. Mechanical investigation showed that \nthe expression level of CPAP is positively correlated with activated STAT3 in \nHCC. CPAP acts as a transcriptional coactivator of STAT3 by directly binding \nwith STAT3. Interrupting the interaction between CPAP and STAT3 attenuates \nSTAT3-mediated tumor growth and angiogenesis. Overexpression of CPAP upregulates \nseveral STAT3 target genes such as IL-8 and CD44 that are involved in \nangiogenesis, and CPAP mRNA expression is positively correlated with the levels \nof both mRNAs in HCC. Knocked-down expression of CPAP impairs IL-6-mediated \nSTAT3 activation, target gene expression, cell migration, and invasion \nabilities. IL-6/STAT3-mediated angiogenesis is significantly increased by CPAP \noverexpression and can be blocked by decreased expression of IL-8. Our findings \nnot only shed light on the importance of CPAP in HCC malignancies, but also \nprovide potential therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the angiogenesis pathway \nand treating metastatic HCC.",

In \nPTEN-null GBM models, LOX inhibition markedly suppresses macrophage infiltration \nand tumor progression.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying \nβ-cell destruction are complex and not fully defined. Here we observed that \nactivation of STAT3 is intensely and specifically inhibited in β-cells under \nhyperglycemic conditions. By knocking out STAT3 specifically in mouse β-cells, \nwe found that the loss of STAT3 sensitized mice to three low doses of STZ \nstimulation resulting in hyperglycemia. Mechanistically, accumulating PTEN, \ninduced by STAT3 deficiency, directly represses phosphorylation of AKT, which \nnegatively modulates transcription factor activation, dysregulates β-cell \nfunction, positively promotes apoptotic signaling, and finally induces β-cell \napoptosis. Notably, the defective secretion of insulin and β-cells apoptosis was \ncompletely rescued by PTEN ablation in STAT3-null islets or PTEN inhibitor \nbpv(phen) treatment. Thus our data suggest that STAT3 is a vital modulator of \nβ-cell survival and function, highlighting a critical role for STAT3 in the \nnegative regulation of PTEN-AKT signaling pathway associated with β-cell \ndysfunction and apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "Beta1 integrin inhibits apoptosis induced by cyclic stretch in annulus fibrosus \ncells via ERK1/2 MAPK pathway.\n\nLow back pain is associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) due to \ncellular loss through apoptosis. Mechanical factors play an important role in \nmaintaining the survival of the annulus fibrosus (AF) cells and the deposition \nof extracellular matrix. However, the mechanisms that excessive mechanical \nforces lead to AF cell apoptosis are not clear. The present study was to look \nfor how AF cells sense mechanical changes. In vivo experiments, the involvement \nof mechanoreceptors in apoptosis was examined by RT-PCR and/or immunoblotting in \nthe lumbar spine of rats subjected to unbalanced dynamic and static forces. In \nvitro experiments, we investigated apoptotic signaling pathways in untransfected \nand transfected AF cells with the lentivirus vector for rat β1 integrin \noverexpression after cyclic stretch. Apoptosis in AF cells was assessed using \nflow cytometry, Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining. Western blotting was used to \nanalyze expression of β1 integrin and caspase-3 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling \nmolecules. In the rat IVDD model, unbalanced dynamic and static forces induced \napoptosis of disc cells, which corresponded to decreased expression of β1 \nintegrin. Cyclic stretch-induced apoptosis in rat AF cells correlated with the \nactivation of caspase-3 and with decreased levels of β1 integrin and the \nphosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 activation level. However, the overexpression \nof β1 integrin in AF cells ameliorated cyclic stretch-induced apoptosis and \ndecreased caspase-3 activation. Furthermore, ERK1/2-specific inhibitor promotes \napoptosis in vector β1-infected AF cells. These results suggest that the \ndisruption of β1 integrin signaling may underlie disc cell apoptosis induced by \nmechanical stress. Further work is necessary to fully elucidate the \npathophysiological mechanisms that underlie IVDD caused by unbalanced dynamic \nand static forces.",

            "TEXT": "ATRIP protects progenitor cells against DNA damage in vivo.\n\nThe maintenance of genomic stability during the cell cycle of progenitor cells \nis essential for the faithful transmission of genetic information. Mutations in \ngenes that ensure genome stability lead to human developmental syndromes. \nMutations in Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) or in ATR-interacting \nprotein (ATRIP) lead to Seckel syndrome, which is characterized by developmental \nmalformations and short life expectancy. While the roles of ATR in replicative \nstress response and chromosomal segregation are well established, it is unknown \nhow ATRIP contributes to maintaining genomic stability in progenitor cells in \nvivo. Here, we generated the first mouse model to investigate ATRIP function. \nConditional inactivation of Atrip in progenitor cells of the CNS and eye led to \nmicrocephaly, microphthalmia and postnatal lethality. To understand the \nmechanisms underlying these malformations, we used lens progenitor cells as a \nmodel and found that ATRIP loss promotes replicative stress and TP53-dependent \ncell death. Trp53 inactivation in Atrip-deficient progenitor cells rescued \napoptosis, but increased mitotic DNA damage and mitotic defects. Our findings \ndemonstrate an essential role of ATRIP in preventing DNA damage accumulation \nduring unchallenged replication.",

            "TEXT": "Mitophagy regulates mitochondrial network signaling, oxidative stress, and \napoptosis during myoblast differentiation.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a degradative process essential for various cellular \nprocesses. We previously demonstrated that autophagy-deficiency causes myoblast \napoptosis and impairs myotube formation. In this study, we continued this work \nwith particular emphasis on mitochondrial remodelling and stress/apoptotic \nsignaling. We found increased (p < 0.05) autophagic (e.g., altered LC3B levels, \nincreased ATG7, decreased SQSTM1) and mitophagic (e.g., BNIP3 upregulation, \nmitochondrial localized GFP-LC3 puncta, and elevated mitochondrial LC3B-II) \nsignaling during myoblast differentiation. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7 \n(shAtg7) decreased these autophagic and mitophagic responses, while increasing \nCASP3 activity and ANXA5/annexin V staining in differentiating myoblasts; \nultimately resulting in dramatically impaired myogenesis. Further confirming the \nimportance of mitophagy in these responses, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of \nBnip3 (bnip3-/-) resulted in increased CASP3 activity and DNA fragmentation as \nwell as impaired myoblast differentiation. In addition, shAtg7 myoblasts \ndisplayed greater endoplasmic reticulum (e.g., increased CAPN activity and HSPA) \nand mitochondrial (e.g., mPTP formation, reduced mitochondrial membrane \npotential, elevated mitochondrial 4-HNE) stress. shAtg7 and bnip3-/- myoblasts \nalso displayed altered mitochondria-associated signaling (e.g., PPARGC1A, DNM1L, \nOPA1) and protein content (e.g., SLC25A4, VDAC1, CYCS). Moreover, shAtg7 \nmyoblasts displayed CYCS and AIFM1 release from mitochondria, and CASP9 \nactivation. Similarly, bnip3-/- myoblasts had significantly higher CASP9 \nactivation during differentiation. Importantly, administration of a chemical \ninhibitor of CASP9 (Ac-LEHD-CHO) or dominant-negative CASP9 (ad-DNCASP9) \npartially recovered differentiation and myogenesis in shAtg7 myoblasts. \nTogether, these data demonstrate an essential role for autophagy in protecting \nmyoblasts from mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling during \ndifferentiation, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial network \nremodelling and myogenesis.",

            "TEXT": "KIF15-Mediated Stabilization of AR and AR-V7 Contributes to Enzalutamide \nResistance in Prostate Cancer.\n\nThe new generation androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitor enzalutamide can \nprolong the survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. However, \nresistance to enzalutamide inevitably develops in these patients, and the \nunderlying mechanisms of this resistance are not fully defined. Here we \ndemonstrate that the kinesin family member 15 (KIF15) contributes to \nenzalutamide resistance by enhancing the AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. \nKIF15 directly bound the N-terminus of AR/AR-V7 and prevented AR/AR-V7 proteins \nfrom degradation by increasing the protein association of ubiquitin-specific \nprotease 14 (USP14) with AR/AR-V7. In turn, the transcriptionally active AR \nstimulated KIF15 expression. KIF15 inhibitors alone or in combination with \nenzalutamide significantly suppressed enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer \ncell growth and xenograft progression. These findings highlight a key role of \nKIF15 in enabling prostate cancer cells to develop therapy resistance to \nenzalutamide and rationalize KIF15 as a potential therapeutic target. \nSIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate how reciprocal activation between KIF15 \nand AR contributes to enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer and highlights \ncotargeting KIF15 and AR as a therapeutic strategy for these tumors.",

How the initiating genomic lesions invoke \nhomology-directed telomere synthesis remains enigmatic. Here, we show that \ndistinct dependencies exist for telomere synthesis in response to replication \nstress or DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). RAD52 deficiency reduced spontaneous \ntelomeric DNA synthesis and replication stress-associated recombination in G2, \nconcomitant with telomere shortening and damage. However, viability and \nproliferation remained unaffected, suggesting that alternative telomere \nrecombination mechanisms compensate in the absence of RAD52. In agreement, RAD52 \nwas dispensable for DSB-induced telomere synthesis. Moreover, a targeted CRISPR \nscreen revealed that loss of the structure-specific endonuclease scaffold SLX4 \nreduced the proliferation of RAD52-null ALT cells. While SLX4 was dispensable \nfor RAD52-mediated ALT telomere synthesis in G2, combined SLX4 and RAD52 loss \nresulted in elevated telomere loss, unresolved telomere recombination \nintermediates, and mitotic infidelity. These findings establish that RAD52 and \nSLX4 mediate distinct postreplicative DNA repair processes that maintain ALT \ntelomere stability and cancer cell viability.",

The mitochondrial regulator PPARGC1A (peroxisome \nproliferator activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha) regulates \nmitochondrial biogenesis, reducing senescence of vascular smooth muscle cells \n(VSMCs); however, it is unknown whether autophagy mediates PPARGC1A-protective \neffects on senescence. Using ppargc1a-/- VSMCs, we identified the autophagy \nreceptor SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1) as a major regulator of autophagy and \nsenescence of VSMCs. Abnormal autophagosomes were observed in VSMCs in aortas of \nppargc1a-/- mice. ppargc1a-/- VSMCs in culture presented reductions in LC3-II \nlevels; in autophagosome number; and in the expression of SQSTM1 (protein and \nmRNA), LAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2), CTSD (cathepsin D), and \nTFRC (transferrin receptor). Reduced SQSTM1 protein expression was also observed \nin aortas of ppargc1a-/- mice and was upregulated by PPARGC1A overexpression, \nsuggesting that SQSTM1 is a direct target of PPARGC1A. Inhibition of autophagy \nby 3-MA (3 methyladenine), spautin-1 or Atg5 (autophagy related 5) siRNA \nstimulated senescence. Rapamycin rescued the effect of Atg5 siRNA in Ppargc1a+/+ \n, but not in ppargc1a-/- VSMCs, suggesting that other targets of MTOR \n(mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase), in addition to autophagy, also \ncontribute to senescence. Sqstm1 siRNA increased senescence basally and in \nresponse to AGT II (angiotensin II) and zinc overload, two known inducers of \nsenescence. Furthermore, Sqstm1 gene deficiency mimicked the phenotype of \nPpargc1a depletion by presenting reduced autophagy and increased senescence in \nvitro and in vivo. Thus, PPARGC1A upregulates autophagy reducing senescence by a \nSQSTM1-dependent mechanism. We propose SQSTM1 as a novel target in therapeutic \ninterventions reducing senescence.",

Resistance \nto chemotherapies is a common feature of SCCs, which leads to a poor prognosis \namong SCC patients. Recently, studies have illustrated the essential tumor \nsuppressive role of ARID1A in several cancer types, but its role in SCCs remains \nunclear. Cancer stemness has been recognized as a main reason for tumorigenesis \nand is commonly correlated with chemoresistance, yet the relationship between \nARID1A and cancer stemness remains unknown. In this study, we showed that Arid1a \nconditional knockout mice had a high incidence of SCCs occurring in the tongue \nand esophagus. ARID1A depletion promoted tumor initiation and cancer stemness in \nhuman SCC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that ARID1A blocked the \ninteraction between cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and retinoblastoma protein \n(Rb), reducing the phosphorylation of Rb. Dephosphorylated Rb suppressed E2F1 \nactivity and then suppressed cancer stemness by inactivating c-Myc. Furthermore, \nwe showed that ARID1A depletion significantly increased the chemoresistance of \nSCC and that a CDK inhibitor exhibited a favorable effect on rescuing the \nchemoresistance caused by ARID1A loss. Collectively, our study showed that \nARID1A inhibits the cancer stemness of SCCs by competing with CDKs to bind with \nRb to inhibit the E2F1/c-Myc pathway.",

            "TEXT": "The mitochondrial retrograde signaling regulates Wnt signaling to promote \ntumorigenesis in colon cancer.\n\nCancer cells are known to upregulate aerobic glycolysis to promote growth, \nproliferation, and survival. However, the role of mitochondrial respiration in \ntumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we report that inhibition of mitochondrial \nfunction by silencing TFAM, a key transcription factor essential for \nmitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and the transcription of mtDNA-encoded \ngenes, markedly reduced tumor-initiating potential of colon cancer cells. \nKnockdown of TFAM significantly decreased mitochondrial respiration in colon \ncancer cells; however, the cellular levels of ATP remained largely unchanged as \na result of increased glycolysis. This metabolic alteration rendered cancer \ncells highly susceptible to glucose deprivation. Interestingly, upregulation of \nglycolysis was independent of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) as TFAM \nknockdown cells fail to stabilize HIF1α under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, \nknockdown of TFAM results in decreased expression of genes-associated cancer \nstem cells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Metabolic analysis reveals \nthat the level of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) was significantly upregulated in TFAM \nknockout cells. Silencing of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein 2 \n(PHD2), a α-KG-dependent dioxyenase, rescued the expression of target genes of \nboth HIF1α and Wnt/β-catenin. Furthermore, intestinal-specific knockout of TFAM \nprevents tumor formation in Apc-mutant mouse models of colon cancer. Taken \ntogether, our findings identify a novel role of mitochondria-mediated retrograde \nsignaling in regulating Wnt signaling and tumor initiation in colon cancer.",

Here, using CD2-cre; mTORC1 \nRaptor-f/f, and mTORC2 Rictor-f/f mice (KO mice), we found that mTORC1, but not \nmTORC2, was required for the proliferation and survival of peripheral γδ T \ncells, especially Vγ4 γδ T cells. Moreover, mTORC1 was essential for both γδ T1 \nand γδ Τ17 differentiation, whereas mTORC2 was required for γδ T17, but not for \nγδ Τ1, differentiation. We further studied the underlying molecular mechanisms \nand found that depletion of mTORC1 resulted in the increased expression of \nSOCS1, which in turn suppressed the key transcription factor Eomes, \nconsequentially reducing IFN-γ production. Whereas the reduced glycolysis \nresulted in impaired γδ Τ17 differentiation in Raptor KO γδ T cells. In \ncontrast, mTORC2 potentiated γδ Τ17 induction by suppressing mitochondrial ROS \n(mitoROS) production. Consistent with their cytokine production profiles, the \nRaptor KO γδ T cells lost their anti-tumor function both in vitro and in vivo, \nwhereas both Raptor and Rictor KO mice were resistant to imiquimod (IMQ)-induced \npsoriasis-like skin pathogenesis. In summary, we identified previously unknown \nfunctions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in γδ T cell differentiation and clarified their \ndivergent roles in mediating the activity of γδ T cells in tumors and \nautoimmunity.",

As such, new targets and \ntherapeutic strategies are urgently required. Here, we show that bone \nmorphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) blocks metastasis in animal models of breast \ncancer and predicts improved survival in patients. In preclinical models of \nspontaneous metastasis, BMP4 acted as an autocrine mediator to modulate a range \nof known metastasis-regulating genes, including Smad7, via activation of \ncanonical BMP-SMAD signaling. Restored BMP4 expression or therapeutically \nadministered BMP4 protein, blocked metastasis and increased survival by \nsensitizing cancer cells to anoikis, thereby reducing the number of circulating \ntumor cells. Gene silencing of Bmp4 or its downstream mediator Smad7, reversed \nthis phenotype. Administration of recombinant BMP4 markedly reduced spontaneous \nmetastasis to lung and bone. Elevated levels of BMP4 and SMAD7 were prognostic \nfor improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival in patients with \nbreast cancer, indicating the importance of canonical BMP4 signaling in the \nsuppression of metastasis and highlighting new avenues for therapy against \nmetastatic disease.",

            "TEXT": "HDAC6 differentially regulates autophagy in stem-like versus differentiated \ncancer cells.\n\nCancer stem-like cells (CSCs), a small population of pluripotent cells residing \nwithin heterogeneous tumor mass, remain highly resistant to various \nchemotherapies as compared to the differentiated cancer cells. It is being \npostulated that CSCs possess unique molecular mechanisms, such as autophagic \nhomeostasis, that allow CSCs to withstand the therapeutic assaults. Here we \ndemonstrate that HDAC6 inhibition differentially modulates \nmacroautophagy/autophagy in CSCs as compared to that of differentiated cancer \ncells. Using human and murine CSC models and differentiated cells, we show that \nthe inhibition or knockdown (KD) of HDAC6 decreases CSC pluripotency by \ndownregulating major pluripotency factors POU5F1, NANOG and SOX2. This decreased \nHDAC6 expression increases ACTB, TUBB3 and CSN2 expression and promotes \ndifferentiation in CSCs in an apoptosis-independent manner. Mechanistically, \nHDAC6 KD in CSCs decreases pluripotency by promoting autophagy, whereas the \ninhibition of pluripotency via retinoic acid treatment, POU5F1 or \nautophagy-related gene (ATG7 and ATG12) KD in CSCs decreases HDAC6 expression \nand promotes differentiation. Interestingly, HDAC6 KD-mediated CSC growth \ninhibition is further enhanced in the presence of autophagy inducers Tat-Beclin \n1 peptide and rapamycin. In contrast to the results observed in CSCs, HDAC6 KD \nin differentiated breast cancer cells downregulates autophagy and increases \napoptosis. Furthermore, the autophagy regulator p-MTOR, upstream negative \nregulators of p-MTOR (TSC1 and TSC2) and downstream effectors of p-MTOR \n(p-RPS6KB and p-EIF4EBP1) are differentially regulated in CSCs versus \ndifferentiated cancer cells following HDAC6 KD. Overall these data identify the \ndifferential regulation of autophagy as a molecular link behind the differing \nchemo-susceptibility of CSCs and differentiated cancer cells.",

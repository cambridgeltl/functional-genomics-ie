            "TEXT": "GPD1 Enhances the Anticancer Effects of Metformin by Synergistically Increasing \nTotal Cellular Glycerol-3-Phosphate.\n\nMetformin is an oral drug widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of metformin in cancer \ntreatment. However, for metformin to elicit effects on cancer often requires a \nhigh dosage, and any underlying mechanism for how to improve its inhibitory \neffects remains unknown. Here, we found that low mRNA expression of \nglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) may predict a poor response to \nmetformin treatment in 15 cancer cell lines. In vitro and in vivo, metformin \ntreatment alone significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, a phenotype \nenhanced by GPD1 overexpression. Total cellular glycerol-3-phosphate \nconcentration was significantly increased by the combination of GPD1 \noverexpression and metformin treatment, which suppressed cancer growth via \ninhibition of mitochondrial function. Eventually, increased reactive oxygen \nspecies and mitochondrial structural damage was observed in GPD1-overexpressing \ncell lines treated with metformin, which may contribute to cell death. In \nsummary, this study demonstrates that GPD1 overexpression enhances the \nanticancer activity of metformin and that patients with increased GPD1 \nexpression in tumor cells may respond better to metformin therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: \nGPD1 overexpression enhances the anticancer effect of metformin through \nsynergistic inhibition of mitochondrial function, thereby providing new insight \ninto metformin-mediated cancer therapy.",

We also discovered the bromo-and-extra-terminal (BET) BRD \nproteins, BRD2 and BRD4, as negative regulators of transcription-associated \nRNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) as inhibition of BRD2 or BRD4 increased R-loop \nformation, which generated DSBs.

There has been some success treating RICD in rodents \nusing human neural stem cell (hNSC) transplantation, but the procedure is \ninvasive, requires immunosuppression, and could cause other complications such \nas teratoma formation. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nanoscale membrane-bound \nstructures that contain biological contents including mRNA, miRNA, proteins, and \nlipids that can be readily isolated from conditioned culture media.

Cognitive function assessed on the novel place \nrecognition, novel object recognition, and temporal order tasks was not only \nimproved at early (5 weeks) but also at delayed (6 months) postirradiation times \nwith just a single EV treatment.

Pathogenic variants in the \nessential gene BRCA2/FANCD1, when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian \ncancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 \nfunction in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 \nrecombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and \nRAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from \nnucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has \nbeen shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant \nnuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. \nHere, based on the analysis of BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants \n(c.8488-1G>A and c.8524C>T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical \nFA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of \nDNA at ICLs.

BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN \nnuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the \nresection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate \nthat unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 \ntranslocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not \nan integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of \nfork protection at different DNA lesions.",

In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a \ndosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar \nataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential \nto prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely \nunknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1's unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' \nUTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. \nBased on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' \nUTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator \nthat binds to a conserved site in ATXN1's 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and \ntranslational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus \n(AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and \nmitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings \nprovide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional \nevidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the \npossibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors \nfor yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.",

Using preclinical models, we show that RMC-4550, an \nallosteric inhibitor of SHP2, induces antitumor immunity, with effects \nequivalent to or greater than those resulting from checkpoint blockade. In the \ntumor microenvironment, inhibition of SHP2 modulated T-cell infiltrates similar \nto checkpoint blockade.

This response is studied \nintensively in epithelial cells, the target of Salmonella during \ngastrointestinal infections. However, little is known of the role that autophagy \nplays in macrophages, the predominant carriers of this pathogen during systemic \ndisease. Here we utilize a zebrafish embryo model to study the interaction of S. \nenterica serovar Typhimurium with the macroautophagy/autophagy machinery of \nmacrophages in vivo. We show that phagocytosis of live but not heat-killed \nSalmonella triggers recruitment of the autophagy marker GFP-Lc3 in a variety of \npatterns labeling tight or spacious bacteria-containing compartments, also \nrevealed by electron microscopy. Neutrophils display similar GFP-Lc3 \nassociations, but genetic modulation of the neutrophil/macrophage balance and \nablation experiments show that macrophages are critical for the defense \nresponse. Deficiency of atg5 reduces GFP-Lc3 recruitment and impairs host \nresistance, in contrast to atg13 deficiency, indicating that Lc3-Salmonella \nassociation at this stage is independent of the autophagy preinitiation complex \nand that macrophages target Salmonella by Lc3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). In \nagreement, GFP-Lc3 recruitment and host resistance are impaired by deficiency of \nRubcn/Rubicon, known as a negative regulator of canonical autophagy and an \ninducer of LAP. We also found strict dependency on NADPH oxidase, another \nessential factor for LAP. Both Rubcn and NADPH oxidase are required to activate \na Salmonella biosensor for reactive oxygen species inside infected macrophages. \nThese results identify LAP as the major host protective autophagy-related \npathway responsible for macrophage defense against Salmonella during systemic \ninfection.",

Mechanistically, the \ntranscription factor NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 1) was found to \nmediate acetyl-CoA-dependent gene regulation and cell adhesion. This occurs \nthrough modulation of Ca2+ signals, triggering NFAT1 nuclear translocation when \nacetyl-CoA is abundant. The findings of this study thus establish that \nacetyl-CoA impacts H3K27ac at specific loci, correlating with gene expression, \nand that expression of cell adhesion genes are driven by acetyl-CoA in part \nthrough activation of Ca2+-NFAT signaling.",

Herein, we investigated the role of Myocilin (Myoc), a skeletal \nmuscle hypertrophy-promoting protein that we showed is downregulated in multiple \nmouse models of cancer cachexia. Loss of Myoc alone was sufficient to induce \nphenotypes identified in mouse models of cancer cachexia, including muscle fiber \natrophy, sarcolemmal fragility, and impaired muscle regeneration. By 18 months \nof age, mice deficient in Myoc showed significant skeletal muscle remodeling, \ncharacterized by increased fat and collagen deposition compared with wild-type \nmice, thus also supporting Myoc as a regulator of muscle quality. In cancer \ncachexia models, maintaining skeletal muscle expression of Myoc significantly \nattenuated muscle loss, while mice lacking Myoc showed enhanced muscle wasting. \nFurthermore, we identified the myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (MEF2C) transcription \nfactor as a key upstream activator of Myoc whose gain of function significantly \ndeterred cancer-induced muscle wasting and dysfunction in a preclinical model of \npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Finally, compared with noncancer \ncontrol patients, MYOC was significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of patients \nwith PDAC defined as cachectic and correlated with MEF2c. These data therefore \nidentify disruptions in MEF2c-dependent transcription of Myoc as a novel \nmechanism of cancer-associated muscle wasting that is similarly disrupted in \nmuscle of patients with cachectic cancer.",

Mechanically, this effect relies on \nzalcitabine-induced mitochondrial DNA stress, which activates the \nSTING1/TMEM173-mediated DNA sensing pathway, leading to \nmacroautophagy/autophagy-dependent ferroptotic cell death via lipid \nperoxidation, but not a type I interferon response. Consequently, the genetic \nand pharmacological inactivation of the autophagy-dependent ferroptosis pathway \ndiminishes the anticancer effects of zalcitabine in cell culture and animal \nmodels. Together, these findings not only provide a new approach for pancreatic \ncancer therapy but also increase our understanding of the interplay between \nautophagy and DNA damage response in shaping cell death.",

In addition to its role in mRNA biosynthesis of \nDNA repair genes, we show here that CDK12 phosphorylates the mRNA 5' cap-binding \nrepressor, 4E-BP1, to promote translation of mTORC1-dependent mRNAs. In \nparticular, we found that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 (T37 and T46) \nfacilitates subsequent CDK12 phosphorylation at two Ser-Pro sites (S65 and T70) \nthat control the exchange of 4E-BP1 with eIF4G at the 5' cap of CHK1 and other \ntarget mRNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (RIP-seq) \nrevealed that CDK12 regulates release of 4E-BP1, and binding of eIF4G, to many \nmTORC1 target mRNAs, including those needed for MYC transformation. Genome-wide \nribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) further identified specific CDK12 \n\"translation-only\" target mRNAs, including many mTORC1 target mRNAs as well as \nmany subunits of mitotic and centromere/centrosome complexes. Accordingly, \nconfocal imaging analyses revealed severe chromosome misalignment, bridging, and \nsegregation defects in cells deprived of CDK12 or CCNK.

It also has a prominent role \nin modulating aging. However, the role of autophagy in the neuronal response to \naxon injury and axon regeneration, particularly in the context of aging, remains \nlargely unknown. Our candidate genetic screen for axon regeneration regulators \nhas identified genes in the autophagy pathway. Using a reporter that monitors \nautophagosomes and autolysosomes, we were able to monitor the dynamics of \nautophagy during axon regeneration. In response to axon injury, there was a \nsignificant increase in the number of autophagic vesicles. Injury-triggered \nautophagy activation and axon regeneration capacity undergo an age-dependent \ndecline, and autophagy-activating agents partially rescued these declines. We \nfound that DLK-1 was both required and sufficient for injury-induced autophagy \nactivation. Autophagic vesicles co-localized with the NOTCH4 ortholog, LIN-12 \nreceptor, a previously identified inhibitor of axon regeneration. Epistasis \nanalyses indicate that LIN-12 might be a target of autophagy in axon \nregeneration. Together, our data suggest that DLK-mediated injury signaling can \nactivate autophagy, which might limit the level of LIN-12 and NOTCH proteins to \npromote axon regeneration. Our findings reveal that autophagy activation can \npromote axon regeneration in neurons that lack maximal regrowth capacity, \nproviding a promising therapeutic strategy for axon injury.",

Given that macroautophagy/autophagy activation is prevalent in \nPDAC, the dual roles of autophagy could be involved in PDAC heterogeneity. In \nthis work, we demonstrated that TGFB1 induced autophagic flux through \nSMAD4-dependent or SMAD4-independent pathways based on a distinct genetic \ncontext. In SMAD4-positive PDAC cells, TGFB1-induced autophagy promoted \nproliferation and inhibited migration by decreasing the nuclear translocation of \nSMAD4. Conversely, TGFB1-induced autophagy inhibited proliferation and promoted \nmigration in SMAD4-negative cells through the regulation of MAPK/ERK activation. \nTGFB1 expression also positively correlated with LC3B expression in PDAC \nspecimens. A high level of LC3B was associated with unfavorable overall survival \n(OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in SMAD4-negative PDAC patients, although \nLC3B could not predict OS and DFS for the 110 PDAC patients. Thus, TGFB1-induced \nautophagy contributed to the different patterns of PDAC progression. This \nknowledge can aid in improving our understanding of the molecular classification \nof PDAC and might guide the development of therapeutic strategies for PDAC, \nespecially for SMAD4-negative PDAC.",

Thus, it is important to \nunderstand how mature oocytes are generated. As a critical stage of oocytes \ndevelopment, meiosis has been extensively studied, yet how chromatin remodeling \ncontributes to this process is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the \nATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factor Snf2h (also known as Smarca5) plays a \ncritical role in regulating meiotic cell cycle progression. Females with \noocyte-specific depletion of Snf2h are infertile and oocytes lacking Snf2h fail \nto undergo meiotic resumption. Mechanistically, depletion of Snf2h results in \ndysregulation of meiosis-related genes, which causes failure of \nmaturation-promoting factor (MPF) activation. ATAC-seq analysis in oocytes \nrevealed that Snf2h regulates transcription of key meiotic genes, such as \nPrkar2b, by increasing its promoter chromatin accessibility. Thus, our studies \nnot only demonstrate the importance of Snf2h in oocyte meiotic resumption, but \nalso reveal the mechanism underlying how a chromatin remodeling factor can \nregulate oocyte meiosis.",

How MYC regulates the metabolism of other \namino acids in cancer is not fully understood. Using high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that MYC \nincreased intracellular levels of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites in the \nkynurenine pathway.

SLC7A5, SLC1A5, and AFMID were \nelevated in colon cancer cells and tissues, and kynurenine was significantly \ngreater in tumor samples than in the respective adjacent normal tissue from \npatients with colon cancer. Compared with normal human colonic epithelial cells, \ncolon cancer cells were more sensitive to the depletion of tryptophan. Blocking \nenzymes in the kynurenine pathway caused preferential death of established colon \ncancer cells and transformed colonic organoids.

            "TEXT": "p300-Mediated Acetylation of Histone Demethylase JMJD1A Prevents Its Degradation \nby Ubiquitin Ligase STUB1 and Enhances Its Activity in Prostate Cancer.\n\nThe androgen receptor (AR) pathway plays a central role in the development of \ncastration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The histone demethylase JMJD1A has \nbeen shown to regulate activities of AR and c-Myc transcription factors and \npromote prostate cancer progression. Here, we report that JMJD1A protein \nstability is controlled by the ubiquitin ligase STUB1. High levels of JMJD1A \nwere strongly correlated with low STUB1 levels in human CRPC specimens. STUB1 \ninhibited AR activity, AR-V7 levels, and prostate cancer cell growth partly \nthrough degradation of JMJD1A. Furthermore, the acetyltransferase p300 \nacetylated JMJD1A at lysine (K) 421, a modification that recruits the BET family \nmember BRD4 to block JMJD1A degradation and promote JMJD1A recruitment to AR \ntargets. Increased levels of both total and K421-acetylated JMJD1A were observed \nin prostate cancer cells as they developed resistance to the AR antagonist \nenzalutamide. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with either p300 or BET \ninhibitors destabilized JMJD1A, and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells \nwere more sensitive than parental cells to these inhibitors. Together, our \nfindings identify a critical role for acetylation of JMJD1A in regulating JMJD1A \nstability and AR activity in CRPC. These newly identified mechanisms controlling \nJMJD1A protein stability provide potential druggable targets to encourage the \ndevelopment of additional therapies for advanced prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: \nIdentification of mechanisms regulating JMJD1A protein stability reveals new \nstrategies to destabilize JMJD1A and concomitantly inhibit AR activities as \npotential prostate cancer therapy.",

The lack of WWP2 or expression of nonubiquitylatable RPB1 abrogates the \nbinding of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factors, including DNA-PK and \nXRCC4/DNA ligase IV, and impairs DSB repair.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the core machinery of autophagy is well \ndefined, but its transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8 \n(autophagy-related 8) protein plays central roles in decorating autophagosomes \nand binding to specific cargo receptors to recruit cargo to autophagosomes. We \npropose that the transcriptional control of ATG8 genes is important during the \nformation of autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during stress. \nHere, we describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for transcription factors \n(TFs) that regulate ATG8 gene expression in Arabidopsis, using the promoters of \n4 ATG8 genes. We identified a total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these \npromoters. The TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF \nfamilies for different promoters, as well as enrichment for families of TFs that \nbound to specific fragments. These TFs are not only involved in plant \ndevelopmental processes but also in the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 \n(TGACG (TGA) motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive \nregulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy under both \ncontrol and stress conditions and transcriptionally up-regulated expression of \nATG8B, ATG8E and additional ATG genes via binding to their promoters. Our \nresults provide a comprehensive resource of TFs that regulate ATG8 gene \nexpression and lay a foundation for understanding the transcriptional regulation \nof plant autophagy.",

To date, \nthese therapies have had limited success due to a lack of survival and retention \nof the infused cells. Therefore, it is important to increase our understanding \nof the biology of these cells and utilize this information to enhance their \nsurvival and function in the injured heart. Mitochondria are critical for \nprogenitor cell function and survival. Here, we demonstrate the importance of \nmitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, in the differentiation process in adult \ncardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). We found that mitophagy was rapidly induced \nupon initiation of differentiation in CPCs. We also found that mitophagy was \nmediated by mitophagy receptors, rather than the PINK1-PRKN/PARKIN pathway. \nMitophagy mediated by BNIP3L/NIX and FUNDC1 was not involved in regulating \nprogenitor cell fate determination, mitochondrial biogenesis, or reprogramming. \nInstead, mitophagy facilitated the CPCs to undergo proper mitochondrial network \nreorganization during differentiation. Abrogating BNIP3L- and FUNDC1-mediated \nmitophagy during differentiation led to sustained mitochondrial fission and \nformation of donut-shaped impaired mitochondria. It also resulted in increased \nsusceptibility to cell death and failure to survive the infarcted heart. \nFinally, aging is associated with accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) \ndamage in cells and we found that acquiring mtDNA mutations selectively \ndisrupted the differentiation-activated mitophagy program in CPCs. These \nfindings demonstrate the importance of BNIP3L- and FUNDC1-mediated mitophagy as \na critical regulator of mitochondrial network formation during differentiation, \nas well as the consequences of accumulating mtDNA mutations.",

Here we utilize data from 12 cancer types \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas to comprehensively map lncRNAs that are potentially \nderegulated by DNA methylation. A novel DNA methylation-deregulated and RNA m6A \nreader-cooperating lncRNA (DMDRMR) facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in \nclear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Mechanistically, DMDRMR bound \ninsulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) to stabilize \ntarget genes, including the cell-cycle kinase CDK4 and three extracellular \nmatrix components (COL6A1, LAMA5, and FN1), by specifically enhancing IGF2BP3 \nactivity on them in an m6A-dependent manner. Consequently, DMDRMR and IGF2BP3 \nenhanced the G1-S transition, thus promoting cell proliferation in ccRCC. In \npatients with ccRCC, high coexpression of DMDRMR and IGF2BP3 was associated with \npoor outcomes. Our findings reveal that DMDRMR cooperates with IGF2BP3 to \nregulate target genes in an m6A-dependent manner and may represent a potential \ndiagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic target in ccRCC.

Here we report inhibition of growth and downstream RAS-MAPK \nsignaling in neuroblastoma cells in response to treatment with the SHP2 \ninhibitors SHP099, II-B08, and RMC-4550. However, neuroblastoma cell lines \nharboring endogenous NRAS Q61K mutation (which is commonly detected at relapse) \nor isogenic neuroblastoma cells engineered to overexpress NRASQ61K were \ndistinctly resistant to SHP2 inhibitors.

The \nrole of Wdr45b in autophagy and in neural homeostasis, however, remains unknown. \nRecent human genetic studies have revealed a potential causative role of WDR45B \nin intellectual disability. Here we demonstrated that mice deficient in Wdr45b \nexhibit motor deficits and learning and memory defects. Histological analysis \nreveals that wdr45b knockout (KO) mice exhibit a large number of swollen axons \nand show cerebellar atrophy. SQSTM1- and ubiquitin-positive aggregates, which \nare autophagy substrates, accumulate in various brain regions in wdr45b KO mice. \nDouble KO mice, wdr45b and wdr45, die within one day after birth and exhibit \nmore severe autophagy defects than either of the single KO mice, suggesting that \nthese two genes act cooperatively in autophagy. Our studies demonstrated that \nWDR45B is critical for neural homeostasis in mice. The wdr45b KO mice provide a \nmodel to study the pathogenesis of intellectual disability.",

It \nplays a major role during normal development, differentiation, and disease \nprogression. The modification is regulated by a set of writer, eraser, and \nreader proteins. The YTH domain family of proteins consists of three homologous \nm6A-binding proteins, Ythdf1, Ythdf2, and Ythdf3, which were suggested to have \ndifferent cellular functions. However, their sequence similarity and their \ntendency to bind the same targets suggest that they may have overlapping roles. \nWe systematically knocked out (KO) the Mettl3 writer, each of the Ythdf readers, \nand the three readers together (triple-KO). We then estimated the effect in vivo \nin mouse gametogenesis, postnatal viability, and in vitro in mouse embryonic \nstem cells (mESCs). In gametogenesis, Mettl3-KO severity is increased as the \ndeletion occurs earlier in the process, and Ythdf2 has a dominant role that \ncannot be compensated by Ythdf1 or Ythdf3, due to differences in readers' \nexpression pattern across different cell types, both in quantity and in spatial \nlocation. Knocking out the three readers together and systematically testing \nviable offspring genotypes revealed a redundancy in the readers' role during \nearly development that is Ythdf1/2/3 gene dosage-dependent. Finally, in mESCs \nthere is compensation between the three Ythdf reader proteins, since the \nresistance to differentiate and the significant effect on mRNA decay occur only \nin the triple-KO cells and not in the single KOs. Thus, we suggest a new model \nfor the Ythdf readers function, in which there is profound dosage-dependent \nredundancy when all three readers are equivalently coexpressed in the same cell \ntypes.",

Although Wnt signaling \nhas been intensively studied in colorectal cancer, it remains unclear whether \nactivity in the tumor-associated stroma contributes to malignancy. To \nspecifically interfere with stromal signals, we generated Wnt-independent tumor \norganoids that secrete the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1. Subcutaneous transplantation \ninto immunocompetent as well as immunodeficient mice resulted in a strong \nreduction of tumor growth. Histologic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that \nSfrp1 induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in tumor \ncells without affecting tumor-intrinsic Wnt signaling, suggesting involvement of \nnonimmune stromal cells. Blockage of canonical signaling using Sfrp1, Dkk1, or \nfibroblast-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin strongly decreased the number \nof cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAF). Wnt activity in CAFs was linked \nwith distinct subtypes, where low and high levels induced an inflammatory-like \nCAF (iCAF) subtype or contractile myCAFs, respectively. Coculture of tumor \norganoids with iCAFs resulted in significant upregulation of EMT markers, while \nmyCAFs reverted this phenotype. In summary, we show that tumor growth and \nmalignancy are differentially regulated via distinct fibroblast subtypes under \nthe influence of juxtacrine Wnt signals.",

We \nreport here the creation of a uniquely acting HSP70 inhibitor (HSP70i) that \ntargets multiple compartments in the cancer cell, including mitochondria. This \ninhibitor was mitochondria toxic and cytotoxic to colorectal cancer cells, but \nnot to normal colon epithelial cells. Inhibition of HSP70 was efficacious as a \nsingle agent in primary and metastatic models of colorectal cancer and enabled \nidentification of novel mitochondrial client proteins for HSP70. In a syngeneic \ncolorectal cancer model, the inhibitor increased immune cell recruitment into \ntumors. Cells treated with the inhibitor secreted danger-associated molecular \npatterns (DAMP), including ATP and HMGB1, and functioned effectively as a tumor \nvaccine. Interestingly, the unique properties of this HSP70i in the disruption \nof mitochondrial function and the inhibition of proteostasis both contributed to \nDAMP release. This HSP70i constitutes a promising therapeutic opportunity in \ncolorectal cancer and may exhibit antitumor activity against other tumor types.",

Using 13C-labeled \ncholine and 13C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and western blotting, we show \nincreased de novo choline phospholipid (ChoPL) production and activation of \nPCYT1A (phosphate cytidylyltransferase 1, choline, alpha), the rate-limiting \nenzyme of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis, during autophagy. We also \ndiscovered that the loss of PCYT1A activity results in compromised autophagosome \nformation and maintenance in autophagic cells. Direct tracing of ChoPLs with \nfluorescence and immunogold labeling imaging revealed the incorporation of newly \nsynthesized ChoPLs into autophagosomal membranes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and \nmitochondria during anticancer drug-induced autophagy. Significant increase in \nthe colocalization of fluorescence signals from the newly synthesized ChoPLs and \nmCherry-MAP1LC3/LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) was also \nfound on autophagosomes accumulating in cells treated with autophagy-modulating \ncompounds.

However, the precise \nmechanisms underlying mitophagy remain largely unknown. Prior studies on \nmitophagy focused on the events in the mitochondrial outer membrane. PHB2 \n(prohibitin 2), which is a highly conserved membrane scaffold protein, was \nrecently identified as a novel inner membrane mitophagy receptor that mediates \nmitophagy. Here, we report a new signaling pathway for PHB2-mediated mitophagy. \nUpon mitochondrial membrane depolarization or misfolded protein aggregation, \nPHB2 depletion destabilizes PINK1 in the mitochondria, which blocks the \nmitochondrial recruitment of PRKN/Parkin, ubiquitin and OPTN (optineurin), \nleading to an inhibition of mitophagy. In addition, PHB2 overexpression directly \ninduces PRKN recruitment to the mitochondria. Moreover, PHB2-mediated mitophagy \nis dependent on the mitochondrial inner membrane protease PARL, which interacts \nwith PHB2 and is activated upon PHB2 depletion. Furthermore, PGAM5, which is \nprocessed by PARL, participates in PHB2-mediated PINK1 stabilization. Finally, a \nligand of PHB proteins that we synthesized, called FL3, was found to strongly \ninhibit PHB2-mediated mitophagy and to effectively block cancer cell growth and \nenergy production at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, our findings reveal that \nthe PHB2-PARL-PGAM5-PINK1 axis is a novel pathway of PHB2-mediated mitophagy and \nthat targeting PHB2 with the chemical compound FL3 is a promising strategy for \ncancer therapy.",

However, the necessity of \nAPBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used \nCRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly \ndefine the function of APBs in ALT. We found that PML is required for the ALT \nmechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs' role in localizing the \nBLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends.

            "TEXT": "Ferroptosis Inducers Are a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Advanced Prostate \nCancer.\n\nFerroptosis is a type of programmed cell death induced by the accumulation of \nlipid peroxidation and lipid reactive oxygen species in cells. It has been \nrecently demonstrated that cancer cells are vulnerable to ferroptosis inducers \n(FIN). However, the therapeutic potential of FINs in prostate cancer in \npreclinical settings has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrate that \nmediators of ferroptosis, solute carrier family 7 member 11, SLC3A2, and \nglutathione peroxidase, are expressed in treatment-resistant prostate cancer. We \nfurther demonstrate that treatment-resistant prostate cancer cells are sensitive \nto two FINs, erastin and RSL3. Treatment with erastin and RSL3 led to a \nsignificant decrease in prostate cancer cell growth and migration in vitro and \nsignificantly delayed the tumor growth of treatment-resistant prostate cancer in \nvivo, with no measurable side effects. Combination of erastin or RSL3 with \nstandard-of-care second-generation antiandrogens for advanced prostate cancer \nhalted prostate cancer cell growth and migration in vitro and tumor growth in \nvivo. These results demonstrate the potential of erastin or RSL3 independently \nand in combination with standard-of-care second-generation antiandrogens as \nnovel therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These \nfindings reveal that induction of ferroptosis is a new therapeutic strategy for \nadvanced prostate cancer as a monotherapy and in combination with \nsecond-generation antiandrogens.",

Recent evidence has shown that hypoxia promotes local \nimmune suppression. Type I IFN supports cytotoxic T lymphocytes by stimulating \nthe maturation of dendritic cells and enhancing their capacity to process and \npresent antigens. However, little is known about the relationship between \nhypoxia and the type I IFN pathway, which comprises the sensing of \ndouble-stranded RNA and DNA (dsRNA/dsDNA) followed by IFNα/β secretion and \ntranscriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). In this study, we \ndetermined the effects of hypoxia on the type I IFN pathway in breast cancer and \nthe mechanisms involved. In cancer cell lines and xenograft models, mRNA and \nprotein expressions of the type I IFN pathway were downregulated under hypoxic \nconditions. This pathway was suppressed at each level of signaling, from the \ndsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, the adaptor MAVS, transcription factors IRF3, \nIRF7, and STAT1, and several ISG including RIG-I, IRF7, STAT1, and ADAR-p150. \nImportantly, IFN secretion was reduced under hypoxic conditions. HIF1α- and \nHIF2α-mediated regulation of gene expression did not explain most of the \neffects. However, ATAC-seq data revealed in hypoxia that peaks with STAT1 and \nIRF3 motifs had decreased accessibility. Collectively, these results indicate \nthat hypoxia leads to an overall downregulation of the type I IFN pathway due to \nrepressed transcription and lower chromatin accessibility in an \nHIF1/2α-independent manner, which could contribute to immunosuppression in \nhypoxic tumors.",

HR uses DNA synthesis to repair \nlesions such as DNA double-strand breaks and stalled DNA replication forks, but \ndespite having a good understanding of the steps leading to homology search and \nstrand invasion, we know much less of the mechanisms that establish \nrecombination-associated DNA polymerization. Here, we report that C17orf53/HROB \nis an OB-fold-containing factor involved in HR that acts by recruiting the \nMCM8-MCM9 helicase to sites of DNA damage to promote DNA synthesis. Mice with \ntargeted mutations in Hrob are infertile due to depletion of germ cells and \ndisplay phenotypes consistent with a prophase I meiotic arrest. The \nHROB-MCM8-MCM9 pathway acts redundantly with the HELQ helicase, and cells \nlacking both HROB and HELQ have severely impaired HR, suggesting that they \nunderpin two major routes for the completion of HR downstream from RAD51. The \nfunction of HROB in HR is reminiscent of that of gp59, which acts as the \nreplicative helicase loader during bacteriophage T4 recombination-dependent DNA \nreplication.

A rate-limiting step for GSH \nbiosynthesis is cystine uptake via a cystine/glutamate antiporter Xc-. Xc- is a \nsodium-independent antiporter passively driven by concentration gradients from \nextracellular cystine and intracellular glutamate across the cell membrane. \nIncreased uptake of cystine via Xc- in cancer cells increases the level of \nextracellular glutamate, which would subsequently restrain cystine uptake via \nXc-. Cancer cells must therefore evolve a mechanism to overcome this negative \nfeedback regulation. In this study, we report that glutamate transporters, in \nparticular SLC1A1, are tightly intertwined with cystine uptake and GSH \nbiosynthesis in lung cancer cells. Dysregulated SLC1A1, a sodium-dependent \nglutamate carrier, actively recycled extracellular glutamate into cells, which \nenhanced the efficiency of cystine uptake via Xc- and GSH biosynthesis as \nmeasured by stable isotope-assisted metabolomics. Conversely, depletion of \nglutamate transporter SLC1A1 increased extracellular glutamate, which inhibited \ncystine uptake, blocked GSH synthesis, and induced oxidative stress-mediated \ncell death or growth inhibition. Moreover, glutamate transporters were \nfrequently upregulated in tissue samples of patients with non-small cell lung \ncancer. Taken together, active uptake of glutamate via SLC1A1 propels cystine \nuptake via Xc- for GSH biosynthesis in lung tumorigenesis.",

            "TEXT": "Cancer Cell-Derived Matrisome Proteins Promote Metastasis in Pancreatic Ductal \nAdenocarcinoma.\n\nThe prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor despite \ndecades of effort. The abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) in PDAC comprises a \nmajor fraction of the tumor mass and plays various roles in promoting resistance \nto therapies. However, nonselective depletion of ECM has led to poor patient \noutcomes. Consistent with that observation, we previously showed that individual \nmatrisome proteins derived from stromal cells correlate with either long or \nshort patient survival. In marked contrast, those derived from cancer cells \ncorrelate strongly with poor survival. Here, we studied three cancer \ncell-derived matrisome proteins that are significantly overrepresented during \nPDAC progression, AGRN (agrin), SERPINB5 (serine protease inhibitor B5), and \nCSTB (cystatin B). Using both overexpression and knockdown experiments, we \ndemonstrate that all three are promoters of PDAC metastasis. Furthermore, these \nproteins operate at different metastatic steps. AGRN promoted \nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in primary tumors, whereas SERPINB5 and \nCSTB enhanced late steps in the metastatic cascade by elevating invadopodia \nformation and in vivo extravasation. All three genes were associated with a poor \nprognosis in human patients and high levels of SERPINB5, secreted by cancer \ncells and deposited in the ECM, correlated with poor patient prognosis. This \nstudy provides strong evidence that cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins can \nbe causal in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis and lead to poor patient \nsurvival. Therefore, compared with the bulk matrix, mostly made by stromal \ncells, precise interventions targeting cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins, \nsuch as AGRN, SERPINB5, and CSTB, may represent preferred potential therapeutic \ntargets. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insights into the biological roles of \ncancer cell-derived matrisome proteins in PDAC and supports the notion that \nthese proteins are protumorigenic and better therapeutic targets.",

Here, we examine the preclinical \nprofile of futibatinib (TAS-120; \n1-[(3S)-[4-amino-3-[(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl]-1H-pyrazolo[3, 4-d] \npyrimidin-1-yl]-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-propen-1-one), a structurally novel, \nirreversible FGFR1-4 inhibitor. Among a panel of 296 human kinases, futibatinib \nselectively inhibited FGFR1-4 with IC50 values of 1.4 to 3.7 nmol/L. Futibatinib \ncovalently bound the FGFR kinase domain, inhibiting FGFR phosphorylation and, in \nturn, downstream signaling in FGFR-deregulated tumor cell lines. Futibatinib \nexhibited potent, selective growth inhibition of several tumor cell lines \n(gastric, lung, multiple myeloma, bladder, endometrial, and breast) harboring \nvarious FGFR genomic aberrations. Oral administration of futibatinib led to \nsignificant dose-dependent tumor reduction in various FGFR-driven human tumor \nxenograft models, and tumor reduction was associated with sustained FGFR \ninhibition, which was proportional to the administered dose. The frequency of \nappearance of drug-resistant clones was lower with futibatinib than a reversible \nATP-competitive FGFR inhibitor, and futibatinib inhibited several drug-resistant \nFGFR2 mutants, including the FGFR2 V565I/L gatekeeper mutants, with greater \npotency than any reversible FGFR inhibitors tested (IC50, 1.3-50.6 nmol/L). \nThese results indicate that futibatinib is a novel orally available, potent, \nselective, and irreversible inhibitor of FGFR1-4 with a broad spectrum of \nantitumor activity in cell lines and xenograft models.

Axin is a concentration-limiting \nfactor responsible for the formation of the β-catenin destruction complex. Wnt \nsignaling itself promotes the degradation of Axin. However, the underlying \nmolecular mechanism and biological relevance of this targeting of Axin have not \nbeen elucidated.

SIAH proteins promote the ubiquitination and \nproteasomal degradation of Axin through interacting with a VxP motif in the \nGSK3-binding domain of Axin, and this function of SIAH is counteracted by GSK3 \nbinding to Axin. Structural analysis reveals that the Axin segment responsible \nfor SIAH binding is also involved in GSK3 binding but adopts distinct \nconformations in Axin/SIAH and Axin/GSK3 complexes. Knockout of SIAH1 blocks \nWnt-induced Axin ubiquitination and attenuates Wnt-induced β-catenin \nstabilization. Our data suggest that Wnt-induced dissociation of the Axin/GSK3 \ncomplex allows SIAH to interact with Axin not associated with GSK3 and promote \nits degradation and that SIAH-mediated Axin degradation represents an important \nfeed-forward mechanism to achieve sustained Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",

The aim of our \ncurrent study was to investigate the possibility and mechanisms of GC-induced \nBAT whitening.

Furthermore, autophagy and ATG7 (autophagy related 7) expression was \ninduced in BAT by Dex, and treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine or \nadenovirus-mediated ATG7 knockdown prevented Dex-induced BAT whitening and fat \nmass gain. Moreover, Dex-increased ATG7 expression and autophagy was mediated by \nenhanced expression of BTG1 (B cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative) \nthat stimulated activity of CREB1 (cAMP response element binding protein 1). The \nimportance of BTG1 in this regulation was further demonstrated by the observed \nBAT whitening in adipocyte-specific BTG1-overexpressing mice and the attenuated \nDex-induced BAT whitening and fat mass gain in mice with BTG1 knockdown in BAT. \nTaken together, we showed that Dex induces a significant whitening of BAT via \nBTG1- and ATG7-dependent autophagy, which might contribute to Dex-increased \nadiposity.

HGF and its \nreceptor MET play critical roles in liver carcinogenesis and metastasis, mainly \ndependent on the activity of receptor tyrosine kinase. However, for unknown \nreasons, all HGF-MET kinase activity-targeted drugs have failed or have been \nsuspended in clinical trials thus far. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a protective \n'self-eating' process for resisting metabolic stress by recycling obsolete \ncomponents, whereas the impact of autophagy-mediated reprogrammed metabolism on \ntherapeutic resistance is largely unclear, especially in liver cancer. In the \npresent study, we first observed that HGF stimulus facilitated the Warburg \neffect and glutaminolysis to promote biogenesis in multiple liver cancer cells. \nWe then identified the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and GLS/GLS1 as \ncrucial substrates of HGF-activated MET kinase; MET-mediated phosphorylation \ninhibits PDHC activity but activates GLS to promote cancer cell metabolism and \nbiogenesis. We further found that the key residues of kinase activity in MET \n(Y1234/1235) also constitute a conserved LC3-interacting region motif \n(Y1234-Y1235-x-V1237). Therefore, on inhibiting HGF-mediated MET kinase \nactivation, Y1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET induced autophagy to maintain \nbiogenesis for cancer cell survival. Moreover, we verified that \nY1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET correlated with autophagy in clinical liver \ncancer. Finally, a combination of MET inhibitor and autophagy suppressor \nsignificantly improved the therapeutic efficiency of liver cancer in vitro and \nin mice. Together, our findings reveal an HGF-MET axis-coordinated functional \ninteraction between tyrosine kinase signaling and autophagy, and establish a \nMET-autophagy double-targeted strategy to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance \nin liver cancer.",

Apart from its \nrole in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, autophagy also involves in \nregulation of cell cycle progression under nutrient-deprivation conditions. \nHowever, whether and how autophagy is regulated by the cell cycle especially \nduring mitosis remains largely undefined.

Deep analysis of the The Cancer \nGenome Atlas database and tissue microarrays showed strong correlation between \nthe major copper influx transporter copper transporter 1 (CTR-1) and PD-L1 \nexpression across many cancers but not in corresponding normal tissues. Copper \nsupplementation enhanced PD-L1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in cancer \ncells and RNA sequencing revealed that copper regulates key signaling pathways \nmediating PD-L1-driven cancer immune evasion. Conversely, copper chelators \ninhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and EGFR and promoted ubiquitin-mediated \ndegradation of PD-L1. Copper-chelating drugs also significantly increased the \nnumber of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T and natural killer cells, slowed tumor \ngrowth, and improved mouse survival. Overall, this study reveals an important \nrole for copper in regulating PD-L1 and suggests that anticancer immunotherapy \nmight be enhanced by pharmacologically reducing intratumor copper levels.",

Because the role of mast cells (MC) in this process is poorly \ncharacterized and even controversial, we investigated their part in breast \ncancer. Crossing C57BL/6 MMTV-PyMT mice, which spontaneously develop mammary \ncarcinomas, with MC-deficient C57BL/6-KitW-sh/W-sh (Wsh) mice, showed that MCs \npromote tumor growth and prevent the development of basal CK5-positive areas in \nfavor of a luminal gene program. When cocultured with breast cancer cells in \nvitro, MCs hindered activation of cMET, a master regulator of the basal program, \nand simultaneously promoted expression and activation of estrogen receptor \n(ESR1/ER) and its target genes (PGR, KRT8/CK8, BCL2), which are all luminal \nmarkers. Moreover, MCs reduced ERBB2/HER2 levels, whose inhibition further \nincreased ESR1 expression. In vivo and in silico analysis of patients with \nbreast cancer revealed a direct correlation between MC density and ESR1 \nexpression. In mice engrafted with HER2-positive breast cancer tumors, \ncoinjection of MCs increased tumor engraftment and outgrowth, supporting the \nlink between MCs and increased risk of relapse in patients with breast cancer. \nTogether, our findings support the notion that MCs influence the phenotype of \nbreast cancer cells by stimulating a luminal phenotype and ultimately modifying \nthe outcome of the disease.",

We recently discovered that \ncytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), extruded from the nucleus of senescent \ncells, trigger the SASP through activation of the innate immunity cytosolic DNA \nsensing cGAS-STING pathway. However, the upstream signaling events that \ninstigate CCF formation remain unknown.

JNK links to 53BP1, a nuclear \nprotein that negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection \nand CCF formation. Importantly, we show that low-dose HDAC inhibitors restore \nexpression of most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation \ngenes, improve mitochondrial function, and suppress CCFs and the SASP in \nsenescent cells. In mouse models, HDAC inhibitors also suppress oxidative \nstress, CCF, inflammation, and tissue damage caused by senescence-inducing \nirradiation and/or acetaminophen-induced mitochondria dysfunction. Overall, our \nfindings outline an extended mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling \npathway that initiates formation of CCF during senescence and is a potential \ntarget for drug-based interventions to inhibit the proaging SASP.",

Consequently, SHP-deficient mice also are more susceptible to \ncerulein-induced pancreatitis.

Specifically, lysosomal \nmembrane damage induces, in succession, ESCRT-dependent membrane repair, \nmacroautophagy/autophagy-dominant removal of damaged lysosomes, and initiation \nof lysosomal biogenesis via transcriptional programs. The MERIT system is \ngoverned by galectins, a family of cytosolically synthesized lectins recognizing \nβ-galactoside glycans. We found in this study that LGALS3 (galectin 3) detects \nmembrane damage by detecting exposed lumenal glycosyl groups, recruits and \norganizes ESCRT components PDCD6IP/ALIX, CHMP4A, and CHMPB at damaged sites on \nthe lysosomes, and facilitates ESCRT-driven repair of lysosomal membrane. At \nlater stages, LGALS3 cooperates with TRIM16, an autophagy receptor-regulator, to \nengage autophagy machinery in removal of excessively damaged lysosomes. In the \nabsence of LGALS3, repair and autophagy are less efficient, whereas TFEB nuclear \ntranslocation increases to compensate lysosomal deficiency via de novo lysosomal \nbiogenesis.

ULK1 functions as a protein complex by \ninteracting with ATG13, RB1CC1/FIP200, and ATG101. How the ULK1 complex is \nregulated to trigger autophagy induction remains unclear. In this study, we have \ndetermined roles of Atg8-family proteins (ATG8s) in regulating ULK1 activity and \nautophagy. Using human cells depleted of each subfamily of ATG8, we found that \nthe GABARAP subfamily positively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore and \nautophagosome formation in response to starvation. In contrast, the LC3 \nsubfamily negatively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore formation. By \nreconstituting ATG8-depleted cells with individual ATG8 members, we identified \nGABARAP and GABARAPL1 as positive and LC3B and LC3C as negative regulators of \nULK1 activity. To address the role of ATG8 binding to ULK1, we mutated the LIR \nof endogenous ULK1 to disrupt the ATG8-ULK1 interaction by genome editing. The \nmutation drastically reduced the activity of ULK1, autophagic degradation of \nSQSTM1, and phagophore formation in response to starvation. The mutation also \nsuppressed the formation and turnover of autophagosomes in response to \nstarvation. Similar to the mutation of the ULK1 LIR, disruption of the \nATG13-ATG8 interaction suppressed ULK1 activity and autophagosome formation. In \ncontrast, RB1CC1 did not show any specific binding to ATG8s, and mutation of its \nLIR did not affect ULK1 activity. Together, this study demonstrates differential \nbinding and opposite regulation of the ULK1 complex by GABARAPs and LC3s, and an \nimportant role of the ULK1- and ATG13-ATG8 interactions in autophagy \ninduction.",

Here we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by \nwhich CDK7 promotes Yki/Yap/Taz stabilization in the nucleus to sustain Hippo \npathway outputs.

Therefore, \nBRCA1-deficient cancers require adaptations that prevent excessive genomic \nalterations from triggering cell death. RNF168-mediated ubiquitination of γH2AX \nat K13/15 (ub-H2AX) serves as a recruitment module for the localization of 53BP1 \nto DNA break sites. Here, we found multiple BRCA1-mutant cancer cell lines and \nprimary tumors with low levels of RNF168 protein expression. Overexpression of \nectopic RNF168 or a ub-H2AX fusion protein induced cell death and delayed \nBRCA1-mutant tumor formation. Cell death resulted from the recruitment of 53BP1 \nto DNA break sites and inhibition of DNA end resection. Strikingly, \nreintroduction of BRCA1 or 53BP1 depletion restored HR and rescued the ability \nof cells to maintain RNF168 and ub-H2AX overexpression. Thus, downregulation of \nRNF168 protein expression is a mechanism for providing BRCA1-null cancer cell \nlines with a residual level of HR that is essential for viability. Overall, our \nwork identifies loss of RNF168 ubiquitin signaling as a proteomic alteration \nthat supports BRCA1-mutant carcinogenesis.

Thus, PPARγ functions as a checkpoint, guarding against inflammation, \nand is permissive for AA by facilitating glutamine metabolism. However, PPARγ \nexpression is itself markedly increased by IL4.

This was not solely \ndue to a defect in autophagic degradation because age-matched mice with muscle \ninactivation of the autophagy essential protein, ATG5, did not demonstrate a \nmyopathy. Notably, myofiber necrosis was preceded by upregulation of \nLGALS3/Galectin-3, a marker of damaged lysosomes, and TFEB activation, \nsuggesting early defects in the lysosomal system. Consistent with that, myofiber \nnecrosis was recapitulated by chemical induction of lysosomal membrane \npermeabilization (LMP) in skeletal muscle. Moreover, TFEB was activated after \nLMP in cells, but activation and nuclear localization of TFEB persisted upon VCP \ninactivation or disease mutant expression. Our data identifies VCP as central \nmediator of both lysosomal clearance and biogenesis in skeletal muscle.",

We previously showed that in colon tumors, a subpopulation of LGR5+ \nCSC-like cells driven by TCF1 (TCF7), a Wnt-responsive transcription factor, \nwere responsible for tumorigenicity. Here we demonstrate that the tumorigenic \nsubpopulation of mouse LGR5+ cells exists in a slow-cycling state and identify a \nunique 22-gene signature that characterizes these slow-cycling CSC. Seven of the \nsignature genes are specifically expressed in slow-cycling LGR5+ cells from \nxenografted human colon tumors and are upregulated in colon cancer clinical \nspecimens. Among these seven, four genes (APCDD1, NOTUM, PROX1, and SP5) are \nknown to be direct Wnt target genes, and PROX1 was expressed in the invasive \nfronts of colon tumors. PROX1 was activated by TCF1 to induce CDKN1C and \nmaintain a slow-cycling state in colon cancer organoids. Strikingly, PROX1 was \nrequired for recurrent growth after chemotherapeutic treatment, suggesting that \ninhibition of slow-cycling CSC by targeting the TCF1-PROX1-CDKN1C pathway is an \neffective strategy to combat refractory colon cancer in combination with \nconventional chemotherapy.",

A gradual decrease of \nMETTL14 (methyltransferase like 14) and an increase of ALKBH5 (alkB homolog 5, \nRNA demethylase) were observed in LCs during their differentiation from stem LCs \nto adult LCs. These events led to reduced mRNA methylation levels of \nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) and enhanced autophagy in LCs. Similar regulation of \nMETTL14, ALKBH5, and m6A was also observed in LCs upon treatment with human \nchorionic gonadotropin (HsCG). Mechanistically, m6A modification promoted \ntranslation of PPM1A (protein phosphatase 1A, magnesium dependent, alpha \nisoform), a negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulator, but \ndecreased expression of CAMKK2 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \nkinase 2, beta), a positive AMPK regulator, by reducing its RNA stability. Thus, \nm6A modification resulted in reduced AMPK activity and subsequent autophagy \ninhibition. We further demonstrated that ALKBH5 upregulation by HsCG was \ndependent on enhanced binding of the transcriptional factor CEBPB \n(CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [C/EBP], beta) and the TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB) to its gene promoter. Moreover, HsCG treatment decreased METTL14 by \nreducing its stability. Collectively, this study highlights a vital role of m6A \nRNA methylation in the modulation of testosterone synthesis in LCs, providing \ninsight into novel therapeutic strategies by exploiting m6A RNA methylation as \ntargets for treating azoospermatism and oligospermatism patients with reduction \nin serum testosterone.",

However, AR reactivation inevitably drives disease \nprogression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here we demonstrate \nthat protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) functions as an epigenetic \nactivator of AR transcription in CRPC, requiring cooperation with a methylosome \nsubunit pICln. In vitro and in xenograft tumors in mice, targeting PRMT5 or \npICln suppressed growth of CRPC cells. Full-length AR and AR-V7 transcription \nactivation required both PRMT5 and pICln but not MEP50. This activation of \ntranscription was accompanied by PRMT5-mediated symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 \nat the proximal AR promoter. Further, knockdown of PRMT5 abolished the binding \nof pICln (but not vice versa) to the AR proximal promoter region, suggesting \nthat PRMT5 recruits pICln to the AR promoter to activate AR transcription. \nDifferential gene expression analysis in 22Rv1 cells confirmed that PRMT5 and \npICln both regulate the androgen signaling pathway. In addition, PRMT5 and pICln \nprotein expression positively correlated with AR and AR-V7 protein expression in \nCRPC tissues and their expression was highly correlated at the mRNA level across \nmultiple publicly available CRPC datasets. Our results suggest that targeting \nPRMT5 or pICln may be explored as a novel therapy for CRPC treatment by \nsuppressing expression of AR and AR splice variants to circumvent AR \nreactivation.",

            "TEXT": "Risk SNP-Mediated Enhancer-Promoter Interaction Drives Colorectal Cancer through \nBoth FADS2 and AP002754.2.\n\nAlthough genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 \ncolorectal cancer risk loci, most of the biological mechanisms associated with \nthese loci remain unclear. Here we first performed a comprehensive expression \nquantitative trait loci analysis in colorectal cancer tissues adjusted for \nmultiple confounders to test the determinants of germline variants in \nestablished GWAS susceptibility loci on mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) \nexpression. Combining integrative functional genomic/epigenomic analyses and a \nlarge-scale population study consisting of 6,024 cases and 10,022 controls, we \nthen prioritized rs174575 with a C>G change as a potential causal candidate for \ncolorectal cancer at 11q12.2, as its G allele was associated with an increased \nrisk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.36; P = \n2.57 × 10-9). rs174575 acted as an allele-specific enhancer to distally \nfacilitate expression of both FADS2 and lncRNA AP002754.2 via long-range \nenhancer-promoter interaction loops, which were mediated by E2F1. AP002754.2 \nfurther activated a transcriptional activator that upregulated FADS2 expression. \nFADS2, in turn, was overexpressed in colorectal cancer tumor tissues and \nfunctioned as a potential oncogene that facilitated colorectal cancer cell \nproliferation and xenograft growth in vitro and in vivo by increasing the \nmetabolism of PGE2, an oncogenic molecule involved in colorectal cancer \ntumorigenesis. Our findings represent a novel mechanism by which a noncoding \nvariant can facilitate long-range genome interactions to modulate the expression \nof multiple genes including not only mRNA, but also lncRNA, which provides new \ninsights into the understanding of colorectal cancer etiology. SIGNIFICANCE: \nThis study provides an oncogenic regulatory circuit among several oncogenes \nincluding E2F1, FADS2, and AP002754.2 underlying the association of rs174575 \nwith colorectal cancer risk, which is driven by long-range enhancer-promoter \ninteraction loops.",

IL33 \ninduction transformed tumor cells into polyploid giant cells, showing abnormal \ncell cycle without cell division accompanied by Snail deregulation and p53 \ninactivation; small progeny cells were generated in response to treatment \nstress. Simultaneously, soluble IL33 was released from tumor cells, leading to \nexpansion of receptor ST2-expressing cells including IL17RB+GATA3+ cells, which \npromoted tumor progression and metastasis directly and indirectly via induction \nof immune exhaustion and dysfunction. Blocking IL33 with a specific mAb in \nmurine IL33+ metastatic tumor models abrogated negative consequences and \nsuccessfully elicited antitumor efficacy induced by other combined treatments. \nEx vivo assays using tumor tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of \npatients with cancer validated the clinical relevancy of these findings. \nTogether, these data suggest that targeting the IL33-ST2 axis is a promising \nstrategy for diagnosis and treatment of patients likely to be resistant to \ntreatments in the clinical settings.",

Searching for strategies that would extend the \nuse of PARP inhibitors to BRCA1-proficient tumors, we found that the stability \nof BRCA1 protein following ionizing radiation (IR) is maintained by \npostphosphorylational prolyl-isomerization adjacent to Ser1191 of BRCA1, \ncatalyzed by prolyl-isomerase Pin1. Extinction of Pin1 decreased homologous \nrecombination (HR) to the level of BRCA1-deficient cells. Pin1 stabilizes BRCA1 \nby preventing ubiquitination of Lys1037 of BRCA1. Loss of Pin1, or introduction \nof a BRCA1-mutant refractory to Pin1 binding, decreased the ability of BRCA1 to \nlocalize to repair foci and augmented IR-induced DNA damage. In vitro growth of \nHR-proficient breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer cells were modestly \nrepressed by olaparib or Pin1 inhibition using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), \nwhile combination treatment resulted in near-complete block of cell \nproliferation. In MDA-MB-231 xenografts and triple-negative breast cancer \npatient-derived xenografts, either loss of Pin1 or ATRA treatment reduced BRCA1 \nexpression and sensitized breast tumors to olaparib. Together, our study reveals \nthat Pin1 inhibition, with clinical widely used ATRA, acts as an effective HR \ndisrupter that sensitizes BRCA1-proficient tumors to PARP inhibition.",

            "TEXT": "POU2F3 is a master regulator of a tuft cell-like variant of small cell lung \ncancer.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is widely considered to be a tumor of pulmonary \nneuroendocrine cells; however, a variant form of this disease has been described \nthat lacks neuroendocrine features. Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR \nscreening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) \nPOU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful \ndependency in a subset of SCLC lines. An analysis of human SCLC specimens \nrevealed that POU2F3 is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC tumors that lack \nexpression of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a \nchemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling \nexperiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell \nidentity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can \nbe classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, \nASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique dependencies in \nPOU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the \nreceptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). These \ndata reveal POU2F3 as a cell identity determinant and a dependency in a tuft \ncell-like variant of SCLC, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of \norigin or a trans-differentiation event in this disease.",

Challenging this assumption are \nrecent findings that indicate chemotherapies, such as cisplatin used to treat \nBRCA-deficient tumors, do not initially cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). \nHere, we show that ssDNA replication gaps underlie the hypersensitivity of \nBRCA-deficient cancer and that defects in homologous recombination (HR) or fork \nprotection (FP) do not. In BRCA-deficient cells, ssDNA gaps developed because \nreplication was not effectively restrained in response to stress. Gap \nsuppression by either restoration of fork restraint or gap filling conferred \ntherapy resistance in tissue culture and BRCA patient tumors. In contrast, \nrestored FP and HR could be uncoupled from therapy resistance when gaps were \npresent. Moreover, DSBs were not detected after therapy when apoptosis was \ninhibited, supporting a framework in which DSBs are not directly induced by \ngenotoxic agents, but rather are induced from cell death nucleases and are not \nfundamental to the mechanism of action of genotoxic agents. Together, these data \nindicate that ssDNA replication gaps underlie the BRCA cancer phenotype, \n\"BRCAness,\" and we propose they are fundamental to the mechanism of action of \ngenotoxic chemotherapies.",

Paradoxically, senescent cells secrete proinflammatory and \ngrowth-stimulatory molecules, termed the senescence-associated secretory \nphenotype (SASP), which is correlated with cancer cell proliferation in culture \nand xenograft models. However, at what tumor stage and how senescence and the \nSASP act on endogenous tumor growth in vivo is unknown. To understand the role \nof senescence in cancer etiology, we subjected p16-3MR transgenic mice, which \npermit the identification and selective elimination of senescent cells in vivo, \nto the well-established two-step protocol of squamous cell skin carcinoma, in \nwhich tumorigenesis is initiated by a carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene, \nand then promoted by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We show that \nTPA promotes skin carcinogenesis by inducing senescence and a SASP. Systemic \ninduction of senescence in nontumor-bearing p16-3MR mice using a chemotherapy \nfollowed by the two-step carcinogenesis protocol potentiated the conversion of \nbenign papillomas to carcinomas by elevating p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK signaling. \nAblation of senescent cells reduced p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK signaling, thereby \npreventing the progression of benign papillomas to carcinomas. Thus, we show for \nthe first time that senescent cells are tumor promoters, not tumor initiators, \nand that they stimulate skin carcinogenesis by elevating p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK \nsignaling.

This metabolic homeostasis is \nexquisitely regulated, and its imbalance could underlie human pathological \nconditions. We report here that C9orf72, which is linked to the most common \nforms of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and \nfrontotemporal dementia (FTD), is a key regulator of lipid metabolism under \nstress. Loss of C9orf72 leads to an overactivation of starvation-induced lipid \nmetabolism that is mediated by dysregulated autophagic digestion of lipids and \nincreased de novo fatty acid synthesis. C9orf72 acts by promoting the lysosomal \ndegradation of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), \nwhich in turn regulates autophagy-lysosomal functions and lipid metabolism. In \nALS/FTD patient-derived neurons or tissues, a reduction in C9orf72 function is \nassociated with dysregulation in the levels of CARM1, fatty acids, and NADPH \noxidase NOX2. These results reveal a C9orf72-CARM1 axis in the control of \nstress-induced lipid metabolism and implicates epigenetic dysregulation in \nrelevant human diseases.",

Here we report that ANXA1 competes with Cbl for binding EphA2 \nand increases its stability by inhibiting Cbl-mediated EphA2 ubiquitination and \ndegradation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Binding of ANXA1 to EphA2 \npromoted NPC cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo by elevating EphA2 \nlevels and increasing activity of EphA2 oncogenic signaling (pS897-EphA2). \nExpression of ANXA1 and EphA2 was positively correlated and both were \nsignificantly higher in NPC tissues than in the normal nasopharyngeal epithelial \ntissues. Patients with high expression of both proteins presented poorer \ndisease-free survival and overall survival relative to patients with high \nexpression of one protein alone. Furthermore, amino acid residues 20-30aa and \n28-30aa of the ANXA1 N-terminus bound EphA2. An 11 amino acid-long ANXA1-derived \npeptide (EYVQTVKSSKG) was developed on the basis of this N-terminal region, \nwhich disrupted the connection of ANXA1 with EphA2, successfully downregulating \nEphA2 expression and dramatically suppressing NPC cell oncogenicity in vitro and \nin mice. These findings suggest that ANXA1 promotes NPC growth and metastasis \nvia binding and stabilization of EphA2 and present a strategy for targeting \nEphA2 degradation and treating NPC with a peptide. This therapeutic strategy may \nalso be extended to other cancers with high expression of both proteins.",

The selectivity of \nautophagy is mediated by autophagy receptors that recognize and recruit cargoes \nto autophagosomes. SQSTM1/p62 is a prototype autophagy receptor, which is \ncommonly found in protein aggregates associated with major neurodegenerative \ndiseases. While accumulation of SQSTM1 implicates a disturbance of selective \nautophagy pathway, the pathogenic mechanism that contributes to impaired \nautophagy degradation remains poorly characterized. Herein we show that \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration \n(FTLD)-linked mutations of TBK1 and SQSTM1 disrupt selective autophagy and cause \nneurotoxicity. Our data demonstrates that proteotoxic stress activates \nserine/threonine kinase TBK1, which coordinates with autophagy kinase ULK1 to \npromote concerted phosphorylation of autophagy receptor SQSTM1 at the UBA domain \nand activation of selective autophagy. In contrast, ALS-FTLD-linked mutations of \nTBK1 or SQSTM1 reduce SQSTM1 phosphorylation and compromise ubiquitinated cargo \nbinding and clearance. Moreover, disease mutation SQSTM1G427R abolishes \nphosphorylation of Ser351 and impairs KEAP1-SQSTM1 interaction, thus diminishing \nNFE2L2/Nrf2-targeted gene expression and increasing TARDBP/TDP-43 associated \nstress granule formation under oxidative stress. Furthermore, expression of \nSQSTM1G427R in neurons impairs dendrite morphology and KEAP1-NFE2L2 signaling. \nTherefore, our results reveal a mechanism whereby pathogenic SQSTM1 mutants \ninhibit selective autophagy and disrupt NFE2L2 anti-oxidative stress response \nunderlying the neurotoxicity in ALS-FTLD.",

Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow \nbiopsies from most of these patients revealed aberrant expression of BCL6, a \ntranscription factor that promotes oncogenic B-cell transformation and drug \nresistance in B-ALL. Our genetic and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation \n[ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) analyses showed that MLL-AF4 \nand MLL-ENL fusions directly bound to the BCL6 promoter and up-regulated BCL6 \nexpression. While oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced aberrant BCL6 \nexpression in B-ALL cells, germline MLL was required to up-regulate Bcl6 in \nresponse to physiological stimuli during normal B-cell development. Inducible \nexpression of Bcl6 increased MLL mRNA levels, which was reversed by genetic \ndeletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bcl6, suggesting a positive feedback \nloop between MLL and BCL6. Highlighting the central role of BCL6 in \nMLL-rearranged B-ALL, conditional deletion and pharmacological inhibition of \nBCL6 compromised leukemogenesis in transplant recipient mice and restored \nsensitivity to vincristine chemotherapy in MLL-rearranged B-ALL patient samples. \nOncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced transcriptional activation of the \nproapoptotic BH3-only molecule BIM, while BCL6 was required to curb MLL-induced \nexpression of BIM. Notably, peptide (RI-BPI) and small molecule (FX1) BCL6 \ninhibitors derepressed BIM and synergized with the BH3-mimetic ABT-199 in \neradicating MLL-rearranged B-ALL cells. These findings uncover MLL-dependent \ntranscriptional activation of BCL6 as a previously unrecognized requirement of \nmalignant transformation by oncogenic MLL fusions and identified BCL6 as a novel \ntarget for the treatment of MLL-rearranged B-ALL.",

Here we report that \nsplice isoforms of the cancer stem cell (CSC) marker CD44 exhibit strikingly \nopposite functions in breast cancer. Bioinformatic annotation in patient breast \ncancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database reveals that the CD44 standard \nsplice isoform (CD44s) positively associates with the CSC gene signatures, \nwhereas the CD44 variant splice isoforms (CD44v) exhibit an inverse association. \nWe show that CD44s is the predominant isoform expressed in breast CSCs. \nElimination of the CD44s isoform impairs CSC traits. Conversely, manipulating \nthe splicing regulator ESRP1 to shift alternative splicing from CD44v to CD44s \nleads to an induction of CSC properties. We further demonstrate that CD44s \nactivates the PDGFRβ/Stat3 cascade to promote CSC traits. These results reveal \nCD44 isoform specificity in CSC and non-CSC states and suggest that alternative \nsplicing provides functional gene versatility that is essential for distinct \ncancer cell states and thus cancer phenotypes.",

Clinical evidence establishes \nan endothelial protective effect of metformin, but the underlying mechanisms \nremain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether metformin exerts its protective \nrole against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial impairment through the autophagy \nmachinery. db/db mice were treated with intravitreal metformin injections. Human \numbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured either in normal glucose \n(NG, 5.5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 33 mM) medium in the presence or absence of \nmetformin for 72 h. We observed an obvious inhibition of hyperglycemia-triggered \nautophagosome synthesis in both the diabetic retinal vasculature and cultured \nHUVECs by metformin, along with restoration of hyperglycemia-impaired Hedgehog \n(Hh) pathway activity. Specifically, deletion of ATG7 in retinal vascular ECs of \ndb/db mice and cultured HUVECs indicated a detrimental role of autophagy in \nhyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. Pretreatment with GANT61, a Hh \npathway inhibitor, abolished the metformin-mediated downregulation of autophagy \nand endothelial protective action. Furthermore, GLI-family (transcription \nfactors of the Hh pathway) knockdown in HUVECs and retinal vasculature revealed \nthat downregulation of hyperglycemia-activated autophagy by the \nmetformin-mediated Hh pathway activation was GLI1 dependent. Mechanistically, \nGLI1 knockdown-triggered autophagy was related to upregulation of BNIP3, which \nsubsequently disrupted the association of BECN1/Beclin 1 and BCL2. The role of \nBNIP3 in BECN1 dissociation from BCL2 was further confirmed by BNIP3 \noverexpression or BNIP3 RNAi. Taken together, the endothelial protective effect \nof metformin under hyperglycemia conditions could be partly attributed to its \nrole in downregulating autophagy via Hh pathway activation.",

However, while arrested, senescent cells secrete a variety of \nproteins collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype \n(SASP), which can reinforce the arrest and induce senescence in a paracrine \nmanner. However, the SASP has also been shown to favor embryonic development, \nwound healing, and even tumor growth, suggesting more complex physiological \nroles than currently understood. Here we uncover timely new functions of the \nSASP in promoting a proregenerative response through the induction of cell \nplasticity and stemness. We show that primary mouse keratinocytes transiently \nexposed to the SASP exhibit increased expression of stem cell markers and \nregenerative capacity in vivo. However, prolonged exposure to the SASP causes a \nsubsequent cell-intrinsic senescence arrest to counter the continued \nregenerative stimuli. Finally, by inducing senescence in single cells in vivo in \nthe liver, we demonstrate that this activates tissue-specific expression of stem \ncell markers. Together, this work uncovers a primary and beneficial role for the \nSASP in promoting cell plasticity and tissue regeneration and introduces the \nconcept that transient therapeutic delivery of senescent cells could be \nharnessed to drive tissue regeneration.",

Here we show \nthat loss of REDD1, a stress-induced metabolic regulator, is sufficient to \nreprogram lipid metabolism and drive progression of RAS mutant cancers. Redd1 \ndeletion in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of KRAS-dependent \npancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas converts preneoplastic lesions into invasive \nand metastatic carcinomas. Metabolic profiling reveals that REDD1-deficient/RAS \nmutant cells exhibit enhanced uptake of lysophospholipids and lipid storage, \ncoupled to augmented fatty acid oxidation that sustains both ATP levels and \nROS-detoxifying NADPH. Mechanistically, REDD1 loss triggers HIF-dependent \nactivation of a lipid storage pathway involving PPARγ and the prometastatic \nfactor CD36. Correspondingly, decreased REDD1 expression and a signature of \nREDD1 loss predict poor outcomes selectively in RAS mutant but not RAS wild-type \nhuman lung and pancreas carcinomas. Collectively, our findings reveal the \nREDD1-mediated stress response as a novel tumor suppressor whose loss defines a \nRAS mutant tumor subset characterized by reprogramming of lipid metabolism, \ninvasive and metastatic progression, and poor prognosis. This work thus provides \nnew mechanistic and clinically relevant insights into the phenotypic \nheterogeneity and metabolic rewiring that underlies these common cancers.",

            "TEXT": "TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) activation suppresses autophagy through inhibition \nof FOXO3 and impairs phagocytic capacity of microglia.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a lysosome-dependent catabolic process for the \nturnover of proteins and organelles in eukaryotes. Autophagy plays an important \nrole in immunity and inflammation, as well as metabolism and cell survival. \nDiverse immune and inflammatory signals induce autophagy in macrophages through \npattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, the \nphysiological role of autophagy and its signaling mechanisms in microglia remain \npoorly understood. Microglia are phagocytic immune cells that are resident in \nthe central nervous system and share many characteristics with macrophages. \nHere, we show that autophagic flux and expression of autophagy-related (Atg) \ngenes in microglia are significantly suppressed upon TLR4 activation by \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS), in contrast to their stimulation by LPS in \nmacrophages. Metabolomics analysis of the levels of phosphatidylinositol \n(PtdIns) and its 3-phosphorylated form, PtdIns3P, in combination with \nbioinformatics prediction, revealed an LPS-induced reduction in the synthesis of \nPtdIns and PtdIns3P in microglia but not macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition \nof PI3K, but not MTOR or MAPK1/3, restored autophagic flux with concomitant \ndephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3. A constitutively active \nform of FOXO3 also induced autophagy, suggesting FOXO3 as a downstream target of \nthe PI3K pathway for autophagy inhibition. LPS treatment impaired phagocytic \ncapacity of microglia, including MAP1LC3B/LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and \namyloid β (Aβ) clearance. PI3K inhibition restored LAP and degradation capacity \nof microglia against Aβ. These findings suggest a unique mechanism for the \nregulation of microglial autophagy and point to the PI3K-FOXO3 pathway as a \npotential therapeutic target to regulate microglial function in brain disorders.",

Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory \nM2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. \nVitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to \ninjury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we \ninvestigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated \nsunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we \ndemonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained \ninhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in \nmyeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression \ncorroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron \nmicroscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following \nvitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy \nincreased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented \nvitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective \ndeletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin \nD-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. \nMechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, \nPparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a \nsimilar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, \nidentifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of \nskin from UV damage.",

To explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a \ncell-based functional screening with SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, \nusing an siRNA library and identified TMED10 (transmembrane p24 trafficking \nprotein 10), previously known as the γ-secretase-modulating protein, as a novel \nregulator of autophagy. Further investigations revealed that depletion of TMED10 \ninduced the activation of autophagy. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction \nassays showed that TMED10 directly binds to ATG4B (autophagy related gene 4B \ncysteine peptidase), and the interaction is diminished under autophagy \nactivation conditions such as rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation. In \naddition, inhibition of TMED10 significantly enhanced the proteolytic activity \nof ATG4B for LC3 cleavage. Importantly, the expression of TMED10 in AD \n(Alzheimer disease) patients was considerably decreased, and downregulation of \nTMED10 increased amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Treatment with Aβ increased ATG4B \nproteolytic activity as well as dissociation of TMED10 and ATG4B.

Thus, novel therapies are still urgently needed. \nBromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, primarily comprised of BRD2, BRD3, \nand BRD4 proteins, function as epigenetic readers and master transcription \ncoactivators and are now recognized cancer therapeutic targets. BET degraders \nsuch as ZBC260 and dBET represent a novel class of BET inhibitors that act by \ninducing BET degradation. The current study demonstrates the therapeutic \nefficacies of BET degraders, particularly ZBC260, against lung cancer, as well \nas understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying molecular markers \nthat determine cell sensitivity to BET degraders. A panel of NSCLC cell lines \npossessed similar response patterns to ZBC260 and dBET but different responses \nto BET inhibitor JQ-1. BRD levels, particularly BRD4, correlated positively with \nhigh sensitivity to BET degraders but not to JQ-1. BET degraders potently \ninduced apoptosis in sensitive NSCLC cells and were accompanied by reduction of \nMcl-1 and c-FLIP levels, which are critical for mediating induction of apoptosis \nand enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, ZBC260 exerted more \npotent activity than JQ-1 in vivo against the growth of NSCLC xenografts and \npatient-derived xenografts. These findings warrant future clinical validation of \nthe efficacy of BET degraders in NSCLC, particularly those with high levels of \nBRD proteins, especially BRD4.",

Here we demonstrate \nan important role of macroautophagy/autophagy (especially mitophagy) in the \nprotective effect of IPC in kidneys. IPC induced autophagy in renal tubular \ncells in mice and suppressed subsequent renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). \nThe protective effect of IPC was abolished by pharmacological inhibitors of \nautophagy and by the ablation of Atg7 from kidney proximal tubules. Pretreatment \nwith BECN1/Beclin1 peptide induced autophagy and protected against IRI. These \nresults suggest the dependence of IPC protection on renal autophagy. During IPC, \nthe mitophagy regulator PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) was activated. \nBoth IPC and BECN1 peptide enhanced mitolysosome formation during renal IRI in \nmitophagy reporter mice, suggesting that IPC may protect kidneys by activating \nmitophagy. We further established an in vitro model of IPC by inducing 'chemical \nischemia' in kidney proximal tubular cells with carbonyl cyanide \n3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Brief treatment with CCCP protected against \nsubsequent injury in these cells and the protective effect was abrogated by \nautophagy inhibition. In vitro IPC increased mitophagosome formation, enhanced \nthe delivery of mitophagosomes to lysosomes, and promoted the clearance of \ndamaged mitochondria during subsequent CCCP treatment. IPC also suppressed \nmitochondrial depolarization, improved ATP production, and inhibited the \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Pink1 suppressed mitophagy \nand reduced the cytoprotective effect of IPC. Together, these results suggest \nthat autophagy, especially mitophagy, plays an important role in the protective \neffect of IPC.",

However, \nthe mechanism by which BST2 uses the selective autophagy pathway to inhibit \nviral replication is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that BST2 \nexpression was significantly increased during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus \n(PEDV) infection of Vero cells by IRF1 targeting its promoter. We also showed \nthat BST2 suppressed PEDV replication by binding and degrading the PEDV-encoded \nnucleocapsid (N) protein. The downregulation of N protein was blocked by \nmacroautophagy/autophagy inhibitors but not a proteasome inhibitor, implying \nthat the N protein was degraded via the selective autophagy pathway. Both the \nBST2 and N protein interacted with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF8/MARCH8 and \nthe cargo receptor CALCOCO2/NDP52, and the ubiquitination of N protein was \nnecessary for the degradation of N mediated by the BST2-MARCHF8 axis. The \nknockdown of MARCHF8 or ATG5 with small interfering RNAs blocked the selective \nautophagy pathway, rescued the protein abundance of PEDV N in 293T cells, and \nprevented the inhibition of PEDV replication by BST2 in Vero cells. Together, \nour data demonstrate the novel mechanism of BST2-mediated virus restriction, in \nwhich BST2 recruits MARCHF8 to catalyze the ubiquitination of the PEDV N \nprotein. The ubiquitinated N protein is then recognized by CALCOCO2/NDP52, which \ndelivers it to autolysosome for degradation through the selective autophagy \npathway.",

The evolutionary \norigins of this two-recombinase system remain poorly understood.

Remarkably, RAD-51 \nfrom Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism without Dmc1, has acquired \"Dmc1-like\" \namino acids.

Here, we show how ubiquitin \nligase UBR5 functions as a molecular rheostat to prevent excess accumulation of \nMYC protein. UBR5 ubiquitinates MYC and its effects on MYC protein stability are \nindependent of FBXW7. Silencing of endogenous UBR5 induced MYC protein \nexpression and regulated MYC target genes. Consistent with the tumor suppressor \nfunction of UBR5 (HYD) in Drosophila, HYD suppressed dMYC-dependent overgrowth \nof wing imaginal discs. In contrast, in cancer cells, UBR5 suppressed \nMYC-dependent priming to therapy-induced apoptosis. Of direct cancer relevance, \nMYC and UBR5 genes were coamplified in MYC-driven human cancers. Functionally, \nUBR5 suppressed MYC-mediated apoptosis in p53-mutant breast cancer cells with \nUBR5/MYC coamplification. Furthermore, single-cell immunofluorescence analysis \ndemonstrated reciprocal expression of UBR5 and MYC in human basal-type breast \ncancer tissues. In summary, UBR5 is a novel MYC ubiquitin ligase and an \nendogenous rheostat for MYC activity. In MYC-amplified, and p53-mutant breast \ncancer cells, UBR5 has an important role in suppressing MYC-mediated apoptosis \npriming and in protection from drug-induced apoptosis.

NRF2 activation metabolically \nrewired and elevated pathways involved in glutamine metabolism. This curbed \nchemoresistance in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancers. In addition, manipulating \nglutamine metabolism restrained the assembly of stress granules, an indicator of \nchemoresistance. Glutaminase inhibitors sensitized chemoresistant pancreatic \ncancer cells to gemcitabine, thereby improving the effectiveness of \nchemotherapy. This therapeutic approach holds promise as a novel therapy for \npatients with pancreatic cancer harboring KRAS mutation. SIGNIFICANCE: These \nfindings illuminate the mechanistic features of KRAS-mediated chemoresistance \nand provide a rationale for exploiting metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic \ncancer cells to confer therapeutic opportunities that could be translated into \nclinical trials.",

TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB)-mediated induction of ALP has been recently considered as the common \nmechanism in ameliorating the pathological lesion of myocardial ischemia and \nneurodegenerative diseases. Here we explored the vital role of TFEB in permanent \nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)-mediated dysfunction of ALP and \nischemic insult in rats. The results showed that ALP function was first enhanced \nin the early stage of the ischemic process, especially in neurons of the cortex, \nand this was accompanied by increased TFEB expression and translocation to the \nnucleus, which was mediated at least in part through activation by \nPPP3/calcineurin. At the later stages of ischemia, a gradual decrease in the \nlevel of nuclear TFEB was coupled with a progressive decline in lysosomal \nactivity, accumulation of autophagosomes and autophagy substrates, and \nexacerbation of the ischemic injury. Notably, neuron-specific overexpression of \nTFEB significantly enhanced ALP function and rescued the ischemic damage, \nstarting as early as 6 h and even lasting to 48 h after ischemia. Furthermore, \nneuron-specific knockdown of TFEB markedly reversed the activation of ALP and \nfurther aggravated the neurological deficits and ischemic outcome at the early \nstage of pMCAO. These results highlight neuronal-targeted TFEB as one of the key \nplayers in the pMCAO-mediated dysfunction of ALP and ischemic injury, and \nidentify TFEB as a promising target for therapies aimed at neuroprotection in \ncerebral ischemia.",

Here, we report that PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1) \nis significantly upregulated and promotes GBM development. The Cancer Genome \nAtlas analysis suggests that the oncogenic role of PAK1 in GBM is mainly \nassociated with autophagy. Subsequent experiments demonstrate that PAK1 indeed \nserves as a positive modulator for hypoxia-induced autophagy in GBM. \nMechanistically, hypoxia induces ELP3-mediated PAK1 acetylation at K420, which \nsuppresses the dimerization of PAK1 and enhances its activity, thereby leading \nto subsequent PAK1-mediated ATG5 (autophagy related 5) phosphorylation at the \nT101 residue. This event not only protects ATG5 from ubiquitination-dependent \ndegradation but also increases the affinity between the ATG12-ATG5 complex and \nATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1). Consequently, ELP3-dependent PAK1 (K420) \nacetylation and PAK1-mediated ATG5 (T101) phosphorylation are required for \nhypoxia-induced autophagy and brain tumorigenesis by promoting autophagosome \nformation. Silencing PAK1 with shRNA or small molecule inhibitor FRAX597 \npotentially blocks autophagy and GBM growth. Furthermore, SIRT1-mediated \nPAK1-deacetylation at K420 hinders autophagy and GBM growth. Clinically, the \nlevels of PAK1 (K420) acetylation significantly correlate with the expression of \nATG5 (T101) phosphorylation in GBM patients. Together, this report uncovers that \nthe acetylation modification and kinase activity of PAK1 plays an instrumental \nrole in hypoxia-induced autophagy initiation and maintaining GBM growth. \nTherefore, PAK1 and its regulator in the autophagy pathway might represent \npotential therapeutic targets for GBM treatment.",

However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms \nare still unclear. Here, we show that upon mRNA binding 4E-T represses \ntranslation and promotes deadenylation via the recruitment of the CCR4-NOT \ndeadenylase complex. The interaction with CCR4-NOT is mediated by previously \nuncharacterized sites in the middle region of 4E-T. Importantly, mRNA decapping \nand decay are inhibited by 4E-T and the deadenylated target is stored in a \nrepressed form. Inhibition of mRNA decapping requires the interaction of 4E-T \nwith the cap-binding proteins eIF4E/4EHP. We further show that regulation of \ndecapping by 4E-T participates in mRNA repression by the miRNA effector protein \nTNRC6B and that 4E-T overexpression interferes with tristetraprolin (TTP)- and \nNOT1-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, we postulate that 4E-T modulates 5'-to-3' decay \nby swapping the fate of a deadenylated mRNA from complete degradation to \nstorage. Our results provide insight into the mechanism of mRNA storage that \ncontrols localized translation and mRNA stability in P-bodies.",

EZH2 expression results in the \nsilencing of genes that suppress tumor formation and metastasis through \ntrimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at their promoters. \nHowever, inhibitors of EZH2 enzymatic activity have not shown the expected \nefficacy against cancer in clinical trials, suggesting a need for other \nstrategies to address EZH2 overexpression. Here, we show that SUMOylation, a \nposttranslational modification characterized by covalent attachment of small \nubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to a lysine (Lys) residue on target \nproteins, enhances EZH2 transcription. Either knockdown of the SUMO-activating \nenzyme SAE2 or pharmacologic inhibition of SUMOylation resulted in decreased \nlevels of EZH2 mRNA and protein as well as reduced H3K27me3 levels. SUMOylation \nregulated EZH2 expression by enhancing binding of the E2F1 transcriptional \nactivator to the EZH2 promoter. Inhibition of SUMOylation not only resulted in \nreduced EZH2 mRNA and protein levels but also increased expression of genes \nsilenced by EZH2, such as E-cadherin, which suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal \ntransition and metastasis. In more than 6,500 patient tumor samples across \ndifferent cancer types, expression of UBA2 and EZH2 was positively correlated. \nTaken together, our findings suggest that inhibition of SUMOylation may serve as \na potential strategy to address EZH2 overexpression and improve current cancer \ntherapeutic approaches.",

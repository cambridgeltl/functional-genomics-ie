            "TEXT": "Macrophages target Salmonella by Lc3-associated phagocytosis in a systemic \ninfection model.\n\nInnate immune defense against intracellular pathogens, like Salmonella, relies \nheavily on the autophagy machinery of the host. This response is studied \nintensively in epithelial cells, the target of Salmonella during \ngastrointestinal infections. However, little is known of the role that autophagy \nplays in macrophages, the predominant carriers of this pathogen during systemic \ndisease. Here we utilize a zebrafish embryo model to study the interaction of S. \nenterica serovar Typhimurium with the macroautophagy/autophagy machinery of \nmacrophages in vivo. We show that phagocytosis of live but not heat-killed \nSalmonella triggers recruitment of the autophagy marker GFP-Lc3 in a variety of \npatterns labeling tight or spacious bacteria-containing compartments, also \nrevealed by electron microscopy. Neutrophils display similar GFP-Lc3 \nassociations, but genetic modulation of the neutrophil/macrophage balance and \nablation experiments show that macrophages are critical for the defense \nresponse. Deficiency of atg5 reduces GFP-Lc3 recruitment and impairs host \nresistance, in contrast to atg13 deficiency, indicating that Lc3-Salmonella \nassociation at this stage is independent of the autophagy preinitiation complex \nand that macrophages target Salmonella by Lc3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). In \nagreement, GFP-Lc3 recruitment and host resistance are impaired by deficiency of \nRubcn/Rubicon, known as a negative regulator of canonical autophagy and an \ninducer of LAP. We also found strict dependency on NADPH oxidase, another \nessential factor for LAP. Both Rubcn and NADPH oxidase are required to activate \na Salmonella biosensor for reactive oxygen species inside infected macrophages. \nThese results identify LAP as the major host protective autophagy-related \npathway responsible for macrophage defense against Salmonella during systemic \ninfection.",

However, the mechanism of SKA3 regulating tumor \nproliferation via reprogramming metabolism is unknown. Here, SKA3 is identified \nas an oncogene in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and high levels of \nSKA3 are closely associated with malignant progression and poor prognosis. In \nvitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that SKA3 promotes LSCC cell \nproliferation and chemoresistance through a novel role of reprogramming \nglycolytic metabolism. Further studies reveal the downstream mechanisms of SKA3, \nwhich can bind and stabilize polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) protein via suppressing \nubiquitin-mediated degradation. The accumulation of PLK1 activates AKT and thus \nupregulates glycolytic enzymes HK2, PFKFB3, and PDK1, resulting in enhancement \nof glycolysis. Furthermore, our data reveal that phosphorylation at Thr360 of \nSKA3 is critical for its binding to PLK1 and the increase in glycolysis. \nCollectively, the novel oncogenic signal axis \"SKA3-PLK1-AKT\" plays a critical \nrole in the glycolysis of LSCC.

Regulations of this fusion process remain poorly defined. Here we \nhave determined the role of SIGMAR1, a unique endoplasmic reticulum membrane \nprotein. Knockout of Sigmar1 impaired mitochondrial clearance without altering \nthe PINK1-PRKN/Parkin signaling, in mouse retinal explants and cultured cells \ntreated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) for induction of \nmitophagy.

Sp1 also has a role in the DNA damage response; at low \nlevels of DNA damage, Sp1 is phosphorylated by ATM and localizes to \ndouble-strand break sites where it facilitates DNA double-strand-break repair. \nDepletion of Sp1 increases the sensitivity of cells to DNA damage, whereas \noverexpression of Sp1 can drive cells into apoptosis. In response to a variety \nof stimuli, Sp1 can be regulated through proteolytic cleavage by caspases and/or \ndegradation. Here, we show that activation of apoptosis through DNA damage or \nTRAIL-mediated activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway induces \ncaspase-mediated cleavage of Sp1. Cleavage of Sp1 was coincident with the \nappearance of cleaved caspase 3, and produced a 70 kDa Sp1 product. In vitro \nanalysis revealed a novel caspase cleavage site at aspartic acid 183. Mutation \nof aspartic acid 183 to alanine conferred resistance to cleavage, and ectopic \nexpression of the Sp1 D183A rendered cells resistant to apoptotic stimuli, \nindicating that Sp1 cleavage is involved in the induction of apoptosis. The \n70 kDa product resulting from caspase cleavage of Sp1 comprises amino acids \n184-785. This truncated form, designated Sp1-70C, which retains transcriptional \nactivity, induced apoptosis when overexpressed in normal epithelial cells, \nwhereas Sp1D183A induced significantly less apoptosis. Together, these data \nreveal a new caspase cleavage site in Sp1 and demonstrate for the first time \nthat caspase cleavage of Sp1 promotes apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "GABARAPs and LC3s have opposite roles in regulating ULK1 for autophagy \ninduction.\n\nULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) is the key mediator of MTORC1 \nsignaling to macroautophagy/autophagy. ULK1 functions as a protein complex by \ninteracting with ATG13, RB1CC1/FIP200, and ATG101. How the ULK1 complex is \nregulated to trigger autophagy induction remains unclear. In this study, we have \ndetermined roles of Atg8-family proteins (ATG8s) in regulating ULK1 activity and \nautophagy. Using human cells depleted of each subfamily of ATG8, we found that \nthe GABARAP subfamily positively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore and \nautophagosome formation in response to starvation. In contrast, the LC3 \nsubfamily negatively regulates ULK1 activity and phagophore formation. By \nreconstituting ATG8-depleted cells with individual ATG8 members, we identified \nGABARAP and GABARAPL1 as positive and LC3B and LC3C as negative regulators of \nULK1 activity. To address the role of ATG8 binding to ULK1, we mutated the LIR \nof endogenous ULK1 to disrupt the ATG8-ULK1 interaction by genome editing. The \nmutation drastically reduced the activity of ULK1, autophagic degradation of \nSQSTM1, and phagophore formation in response to starvation. The mutation also \nsuppressed the formation and turnover of autophagosomes in response to \nstarvation. Similar to the mutation of the ULK1 LIR, disruption of the \nATG13-ATG8 interaction suppressed ULK1 activity and autophagosome formation. In \ncontrast, RB1CC1 did not show any specific binding to ATG8s, and mutation of its \nLIR did not affect ULK1 activity. Together, this study demonstrates differential \nbinding and opposite regulation of the ULK1 complex by GABARAPs and LC3s, and an \nimportant role of the ULK1- and ATG13-ATG8 interactions in autophagy \ninduction.",

Using a selective CDK7 inhibitor, YKL-5-124, we \ndemonstrated that CDK7 inhibition predominately disrupts cell-cycle progression \nand induces DNA replication stress and genome instability in small cell lung \ncancer (SCLC) while simultaneously triggering immune-response signaling.

Autophagy plays critical \nroles in glia and neurons that affect development, functionality, and viability \nof the nervous system. The mechanisms that regulate autophagy in glia and \nneurons, however, are poorly understood. Here, we define the molecular \nunderpinnings of autophagy in primary cortical astrocytes in response to \nmetabolic stress, and perform a comparative study in primary hippocampal \nneurons. We find that inducing metabolic stress by nutrient deprivation or \npharmacological inhibition of MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) \nrobustly activates autophagy in astrocytes. While both paradigms of metabolic \nstress dampen MTOR signaling, they affect the autophagy pathway differently. \nFurther, we find that starvation-induced autophagic flux is dependent on the \nbuffering system of the starvation solution. Lastly, starvation conditions that \nstrongly activate autophagy in astrocytes have less pronounced effects on \nautophagy in neurons. Combined, our study reveals the complexity of regulating \nautophagy in different paradigms of metabolic stress, as well as in different \ncell types of the brain.

We \nconsidered that surfactant-associated protein D (SP-D), an innate immune \ncollectin present on many mucosal surfaces, could regulate apoptosis. Although \nSP-D is known to be important for immune cell homeostasis, whether SP-D affects \napoptosis is unknown. In this study we aimed to determine the effects of SP-D on \nJurkat T cells and human T cells dying by apoptosis. Here we show that SP-D \nbinds to Jurkat T cells and delays the progression of Fas (CD95)-Fas ligand and \nTRAIL-TRAIL receptor induced, but not TNF-TNF receptor-mediated apoptosis. SP-D \nexerts its effects by reducing the activation of initiator caspase-8 and \nexecutioner caspase-3. SP-D also delays the surface exposure of \nphosphatidylserine. The effect of SP-D was ablated by the presence of caspase-8 \ninhibitor, but not by intrinsic pathway inhibitors. The binding ability of SP-D \nto dying cells decreases during the early stages of apoptosis, suggesting the \nrelease of apoptotic cell surface targets during apoptosis. SP-D also delays \nFasL-induced death of primary human T cells. SP-D delaying the progression of \nthe extrinsic pathway of apoptosis could have important implications in \nregulating immune cell homeostasis at mucosal surfaces.",

While the activity \nof system Xc- often positively correlates with the expression level of its light \nchain encoded by SLC7A11, inhibition of system Xc- activity by small molecules \n(e.g., erastin) causes a decrease in the intracellular GSH level, leading to \nferroptotic cell death. How system Xc- is regulated during ferroptosis remains \nlargely unknown. Here we report that activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), a \ncommon stress sensor, can promote ferroptosis induced by erastin. ATF3 \nsuppressed system Xc-, depleted intracellular GSH, and thereby promoted lipid \nperoxidation induced by erastin. ATF3 achieved this activity through binding to \nthe SLC7A11 promoter and repressing SLC7A11 expression in a p53-independent \nmanner. These findings thus add ATF3 to a short list of proteins that can \nregulate system Xc- and promote ferroptosis repressed by this antiporter.",

The YAP activity of the different \nYAP1 fusions is resistant to negative Hippo pathway regulation due to \nconstitutive nuclear localization and resistance to degradation of the YAP1 \nfusion proteins. Genetic disruption of the TEAD-binding domain of these \noncogenic YAP1 fusions is sufficient to inhibit tumor formation in vivo, while \npharmacological inhibition of the YAP1-TEAD interaction inhibits the growth of \nYAP1 fusion-expressing cell lines in vitro.

Clinical evidence establishes \nan endothelial protective effect of metformin, but the underlying mechanisms \nremain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether metformin exerts its protective \nrole against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial impairment through the autophagy \nmachinery. db/db mice were treated with intravitreal metformin injections. Human \numbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were cultured either in normal glucose \n(NG, 5.5 mM) or high glucose (HG, 33 mM) medium in the presence or absence of \nmetformin for 72 h. We observed an obvious inhibition of hyperglycemia-triggered \nautophagosome synthesis in both the diabetic retinal vasculature and cultured \nHUVECs by metformin, along with restoration of hyperglycemia-impaired Hedgehog \n(Hh) pathway activity. Specifically, deletion of ATG7 in retinal vascular ECs of \ndb/db mice and cultured HUVECs indicated a detrimental role of autophagy in \nhyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. Pretreatment with GANT61, a Hh \npathway inhibitor, abolished the metformin-mediated downregulation of autophagy \nand endothelial protective action. Furthermore, GLI-family (transcription \nfactors of the Hh pathway) knockdown in HUVECs and retinal vasculature revealed \nthat downregulation of hyperglycemia-activated autophagy by the \nmetformin-mediated Hh pathway activation was GLI1 dependent. Mechanistically, \nGLI1 knockdown-triggered autophagy was related to upregulation of BNIP3, which \nsubsequently disrupted the association of BECN1/Beclin 1 and BCL2. The role of \nBNIP3 in BECN1 dissociation from BCL2 was further confirmed by BNIP3 \noverexpression or BNIP3 RNAi. Taken together, the endothelial protective effect \nof metformin under hyperglycemia conditions could be partly attributed to its \nrole in downregulating autophagy via Hh pathway activation.",

Disrupting various cell adhesion genes \nmarkedly reduces cluster formation and colonization efficiency, yet the \ndownstream signals transmitted by clustering remain largely unknown. Here, we \nuse mouse and human breast cancer models to identify a collective signal \ngenerated by tumor cell clusters supporting metastatic colonization. We show \nthat tumor cell clusters produce the growth factor epigen and concentrate it \nwithin nanolumina-intercellular compartments sealed by cell-cell junctions and \nlined with microvilli-like protrusions. Epigen knockdown profoundly reduces \nmetastatic outgrowth and switches clusters from a proliferative to a collective \nmigratory state. Tumor cell clusters from basal-like 2, but not \nmesenchymal-like, triple-negative breast cancer cell lines have increased epigen \nexpression, sealed nanolumina, and impaired outgrowth upon nanolumenal junction \ndisruption. We propose that nanolumenal signaling could offer a therapeutic \ntarget for aggressive metastatic breast cancers.",

Transcriptome expression \nprofiles of PDAC tissues with different perineural invasion status were \ncompared, and the intratumoral T-cell density and levels of neurotransmitters in \nthese tissues were assessed.

Moreover, acetylcholine directly inhibited \nIFNγ production by CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner and favored Th2 over \nTh1 differentiation. Furthermore, hyperactivation of cholinergic signaling \nenhanced tumor growth by suppressing the intratumoral T-cell response in an \northotopic PDAC model. Conversely, blocking perineural invasion with bilateral \nsubdiaphragmatic vagotomy in tumor-bearing mice was associated with an increase \nin CD8+ T cells, an elevated Th1/Th2 ratio, and improved survival.

Large sequencing studies of \nneuroblastoma tumors from diagnosis have not identified common targetable driver \nmutations other than the 10% of tumors that harbor mutations in the anaplastic \nlymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. However, at neuroblastoma recurrence, more frequent \nmutations in genes in the RAS-MAPK pathway have been detected. The \nPTPN11-encoded tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is an activator of the RAS pathway, and \nwe and others have shown that pharmacologic inhibition of SHP2 suppresses the \ngrowth of various tumor types harboring KRAS mutations such as pancreatic and \nlung cancers. Here we report inhibition of growth and downstream RAS-MAPK \nsignaling in neuroblastoma cells in response to treatment with the SHP2 \ninhibitors SHP099, II-B08, and RMC-4550. However, neuroblastoma cell lines \nharboring endogenous NRAS Q61K mutation (which is commonly detected at relapse) \nor isogenic neuroblastoma cells engineered to overexpress NRASQ61K were \ndistinctly resistant to SHP2 inhibitors. Combinations of SHP2 inhibitors with \nother RAS pathway inhibitors such as trametinib, vemurafenib, and ulixertinib \nwere synergistic and reversed resistance to SHP2 inhibition in neuroblastoma in \nvitro and in vivo.

            "TEXT": "Cellular Senescence Promotes Skin Carcinogenesis through p38MAPK and p44/42MAPK \nSignaling.\n\nCellular senescence entails an irreversible growth arrest that evolved in part \nto prevent cancer. Paradoxically, senescent cells secrete proinflammatory and \ngrowth-stimulatory molecules, termed the senescence-associated secretory \nphenotype (SASP), which is correlated with cancer cell proliferation in culture \nand xenograft models. However, at what tumor stage and how senescence and the \nSASP act on endogenous tumor growth in vivo is unknown. To understand the role \nof senescence in cancer etiology, we subjected p16-3MR transgenic mice, which \npermit the identification and selective elimination of senescent cells in vivo, \nto the well-established two-step protocol of squamous cell skin carcinoma, in \nwhich tumorigenesis is initiated by a carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene, \nand then promoted by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We show that \nTPA promotes skin carcinogenesis by inducing senescence and a SASP. Systemic \ninduction of senescence in nontumor-bearing p16-3MR mice using a chemotherapy \nfollowed by the two-step carcinogenesis protocol potentiated the conversion of \nbenign papillomas to carcinomas by elevating p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK signaling. \nAblation of senescent cells reduced p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK signaling, thereby \npreventing the progression of benign papillomas to carcinomas. Thus, we show for \nthe first time that senescent cells are tumor promoters, not tumor initiators, \nand that they stimulate skin carcinogenesis by elevating p38MAPK and MAPK/ERK \nsignaling. These findings pave the way for developing novel therapeutics against \nsenescence-fueled cancers.",

Challenging this assumption are \nrecent findings that indicate chemotherapies, such as cisplatin used to treat \nBRCA-deficient tumors, do not initially cause DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). \nHere, we show that ssDNA replication gaps underlie the hypersensitivity of \nBRCA-deficient cancer and that defects in homologous recombination (HR) or fork \nprotection (FP) do not. In BRCA-deficient cells, ssDNA gaps developed because \nreplication was not effectively restrained in response to stress. Gap \nsuppression by either restoration of fork restraint or gap filling conferred \ntherapy resistance in tissue culture and BRCA patient tumors. In contrast, \nrestored FP and HR could be uncoupled from therapy resistance when gaps were \npresent. Moreover, DSBs were not detected after therapy when apoptosis was \ninhibited, supporting a framework in which DSBs are not directly induced by \ngenotoxic agents, but rather are induced from cell death nucleases and are not \nfundamental to the mechanism of action of genotoxic agents. Together, these data \nindicate that ssDNA replication gaps underlie the BRCA cancer phenotype, \n\"BRCAness,\" and we propose they are fundamental to the mechanism of action of \ngenotoxic chemotherapies.",

            "TEXT": "BST2 suppresses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus replication by targeting and \ndegrading virus nucleocapsid protein with selective autophagy.\n\nInterferon-induced BST2 (bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2) inhibits viral \nreplication by tethering enveloped virions to the cell surface to restrict viral \nrelease and by inducing the NFKB-dependent antiviral immune response. However, \nthe mechanism by which BST2 uses the selective autophagy pathway to inhibit \nviral replication is poorly understood. In this study, we showed that BST2 \nexpression was significantly increased during porcine epidemic diarrhea virus \n(PEDV) infection of Vero cells by IRF1 targeting its promoter. We also showed \nthat BST2 suppressed PEDV replication by binding and degrading the PEDV-encoded \nnucleocapsid (N) protein. The downregulation of N protein was blocked by \nmacroautophagy/autophagy inhibitors but not a proteasome inhibitor, implying \nthat the N protein was degraded via the selective autophagy pathway. Both the \nBST2 and N protein interacted with the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF8/MARCH8 and \nthe cargo receptor CALCOCO2/NDP52, and the ubiquitination of N protein was \nnecessary for the degradation of N mediated by the BST2-MARCHF8 axis. The \nknockdown of MARCHF8 or ATG5 with small interfering RNAs blocked the selective \nautophagy pathway, rescued the protein abundance of PEDV N in 293T cells, and \nprevented the inhibition of PEDV replication by BST2 in Vero cells. Together, \nour data demonstrate the novel mechanism of BST2-mediated virus restriction, in \nwhich BST2 recruits MARCHF8 to catalyze the ubiquitination of the PEDV N \nprotein. The ubiquitinated N protein is then recognized by CALCOCO2/NDP52, which \ndelivers it to autolysosome for degradation through the selective autophagy \npathway.",

Here we report that ANXA1 competes with Cbl for binding EphA2 \nand increases its stability by inhibiting Cbl-mediated EphA2 ubiquitination and \ndegradation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Binding of ANXA1 to EphA2 \npromoted NPC cell growth and metastasis in vitro and in vivo by elevating EphA2 \nlevels and increasing activity of EphA2 oncogenic signaling (pS897-EphA2). \nExpression of ANXA1 and EphA2 was positively correlated and both were \nsignificantly higher in NPC tissues than in the normal nasopharyngeal epithelial \ntissues. Patients with high expression of both proteins presented poorer \ndisease-free survival and overall survival relative to patients with high \nexpression of one protein alone. Furthermore, amino acid residues 20-30aa and \n28-30aa of the ANXA1 N-terminus bound EphA2. An 11 amino acid-long ANXA1-derived \npeptide (EYVQTVKSSKG) was developed on the basis of this N-terminal region, \nwhich disrupted the connection of ANXA1 with EphA2, successfully downregulating \nEphA2 expression and dramatically suppressing NPC cell oncogenicity in vitro and \nin mice. These findings suggest that ANXA1 promotes NPC growth and metastasis \nvia binding and stabilization of EphA2 and present a strategy for targeting \nEphA2 degradation and treating NPC with a peptide. This therapeutic strategy may \nalso be extended to other cancers with high expression of both proteins.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted casein kinase II (CK2) and p38 MAPK \nactivation, production of diverse cytokines, and shutdown of mitotic kinases, \nresulting in cell cycle arrest. Infection also stimulated a marked induction of \nCK2-containing filopodial protrusions possessing budding viral particles. \nEighty-seven drugs and compounds were identified by mapping global \nphosphorylation profiles to dysregulated kinases and pathways. We found \npharmacologic inhibition of the p38, CK2, CDK, AXL, and PIKFYVE kinases to \npossess antiviral efficacy, representing potential COVID-19 therapies.",

Here, we show that fibroblasts isolated \nfrom patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), chronic pancreatitis \n(CP), periampullary tumors, and adjacent normal (NA) tissue (N = 34) have \ndistinct mRNA and miRNA profiles. Compared with NA fibroblasts, PDAC-associated \nfibroblasts were generally less sensitive to an antifibrotic stimulus (NPPB) and \nmore responsive to positive regulators of activation such as TGFβ1 and WNT. Of \nthe disease-associated fibroblasts examined, PDAC- and CP-derived fibroblasts \nshared greatest similarity, yet PDAC-associated fibroblasts expressed higher \nlevels of tenascin C (TNC), a finding attributable to miR-137, a novel regulator \nof TNC. TNC protein and transcript levels were higher in PDAC tissue versus CP \ntissue and were associated with greater levels of stromal activation, and \nconditioned media from TNC-depleted PDAC-associated fibroblasts modestly \nincreased both PDAC cell proliferation and PDAC cell migration, indicating that \nstromal TNC may have inhibitory effects on PDAC cells. Finally, circulating TNC \nlevels were higher in patients with PDAC compared with CP.

Specifically, lysosomal \nmembrane damage induces, in succession, ESCRT-dependent membrane repair, \nmacroautophagy/autophagy-dominant removal of damaged lysosomes, and initiation \nof lysosomal biogenesis via transcriptional programs. The MERIT system is \ngoverned by galectins, a family of cytosolically synthesized lectins recognizing \nβ-galactoside glycans.

At \nlater stages, LGALS3 cooperates with TRIM16, an autophagy receptor-regulator, to \nengage autophagy machinery in removal of excessively damaged lysosomes. In the \nabsence of LGALS3, repair and autophagy are less efficient, whereas TFEB nuclear \ntranslocation increases to compensate lysosomal deficiency via de novo lysosomal \nbiogenesis.

However, the mechanisms underlying this neuronal \nloss remain largely unknown. Oxidative stress and ER stress have been implicated \nin PD and these factors are known to activate the integrated stress response \n(ISR). Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a key mediator of the ISR, and \nhas been reported to induce the expression of genes involved in cellular \nhomeostasis. However, during prolonged activation ATF4 can also induce the \nexpression of pro-death target genes. Therefore, in the present study, we \ninvestigated the role of ATF4 in neuronal cell death in models of PD. We \ndemonstrate that PD neurotoxins (MPP+ and 6-OHDA) and α-synuclein aggregation \ninduced by pre-formed human alpha-synuclein fibrils (PFFs) cause sustained \nupregulation of ATF4 expression in mouse cortical and mesencephalic dopaminergic \nneurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PD neurotoxins induce the expression \nof the pro-apoptotic factors Chop, Trb3, and Puma in dopaminergic neurons in an \nATF4-dependent manner. Importantly, we have determined that PD neurotoxin and \nα-synuclein PFF induced neuronal death is attenuated in ATF4-deficient \ndopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ATF4 but not \ntranscriptionally defective ATF4ΔRK restores sensitivity of ATF4-deficient \nneurons to PD neurotoxins. Finally, we demonstrate that the eIF2α kinase \ninhibitor C16 suppresses MPP+ and 6-OHDA induced ATF4 activation and protects \nagainst PD neurotoxin induced dopaminergic neuronal death.

The Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1)/eyes absent \n(EYA) transcriptional complex plays a critical role in the development of \nmultiple organs and is typically downregulated after development is complete. In \nbreast cancer, aberrant expression of SIX1 has been demonstrated to stimulate \nmetastasis through activation of TGFβ signaling and subsequent induction of \nepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, SIX1 can induce metastasis \nvia non-cell autonomous means, including activation of GLI-signaling in \nneighboring tumor cells and activation of VEGFC-induced lymphangiogenesis. Thus, \ntargeting SIX1 would be expected to inhibit metastasis while conferring limited \nside effects. However, transcription factors are notoriously difficult to \ntarget, and thus novel approaches to inhibit their action must be taken. Here we \nidentified a novel small molecule compound, NCGC00378430 (abbreviated as 8430), \nthat reduces the SIX1/EYA2 interaction. 8430 partially reversed transcriptional \nand metabolic profiles mediated by SIX1 overexpression and reversed SIX1-induced \nTGFβ signaling and EMT. 8430 was well tolerated when delivered to mice and \nsignificantly suppressed breast cancer-associated metastasis in vivo without \nsignificantly altering primary tumor growth. Thus, we have demonstrated for the \nfirst time that pharmacologic inhibition of the SIX1/EYA2 complex and associated \nphenotypes is sufficient to suppress breast cancer metastasis.",

Consequently, apoptosis imaging is helpful for noninvasively \ndetecting the disease progression and providing treatment guidance. Here, we \ntested 18F-labeled 2-(5-fluoropentyl)-2-methyl-malonic acid (18F-ML-10) and \n18F-labeled 2-(3-fluoropropyl)-2-methyl-malonic acid (18F-ML-8) for apoptosis \nimaging in rat models of myocardial infarction (MI) and compared them with \n18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). MI was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by \npermanent left coronary artery ligation. Procedural success was confirmed by \nechocardiography and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 18F-FDG. In \nvivo PET imaging with 18F-ML-10 and 18F-ML-8 was performed in the MI models at \ndifferent time points after operation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase \ndUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays and immunohistochemical analyses were used \nto evaluate myocardial apoptosis. In vitro cell binding assays were performed to \nvalidate 18F-ML-8 binding to apoptotic cardiomyocytes. PET imaging demonstrated \nhigh 18F-ML-10 and 18F-ML-8 uptake where 18F-FDG uptake was absent. The focal \naccumulation of the two tracers was high on days 1 and 3 but was not notable on \ndays 5 and 7 after surgery. The infarct-to-lung uptake ratio was 4.29 ± 0.30 for \n18F-ML-10 and 3.51 ± 0.18 for 18F-ML-8 (n = 6, analyzed by averaging the uptake \nratios on postoperative days 1 and 3, P < 0.05). The TUNEL results showed that \nmyocardial cell apoptosis was closely related to the focal uptake of the \napoptotic tracers in the infarct area. In addition, the apoptosis rates \ncalculated from the TUNEL results were better correlated with 18F-ML-8 uptake \nthan with 18F-ML-10 uptake. Ex vivo cell binding assays demonstrated that \n18F-ML-8 accumulated in apoptotic cells but not in necrotic or normal cells. PET \nimaging using 18F-ML-10 or 18F-ML-8 allows the noninvasive detection of \nmyocardial apoptosis in the early phase. In addition, 18F-ML-8 may be better \nthan 18F-ML-10 for apoptosis imaging. We propose that PET imaging with 18F-ML-10 \nor 18F-ML-8 combined with 18F-FDG is an alternative for detecting and assessing \nMI.",

Applying these approaches, we identify 24 of the \n42 BRD proteins as promoters of DNA repair and/or genome integrity. We \nidentified a BRD-reader function of PCAF that bound TIP60-mediated histone \nacetylations at DSBs to recruit a DUB complex to deubiquitylate histone H2BK120, \nto allowing direct acetylation by PCAF, and repair of DSBs by homologous \nrecombination. We also discovered the bromo-and-extra-terminal (BET) BRD \nproteins, BRD2 and BRD4, as negative regulators of transcription-associated \nRNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) as inhibition of BRD2 or BRD4 increased R-loop \nformation, which generated DSBs.

Multiple lines of \nevidence show the endothelin (EDN, also known as ET) system is important in \nglaucomatous neurodegeneration. To date, the molecular mechanisms within RGCs \ndriving EDN-induced RGC death have not been clarified. The pro-apoptotic \ntranscription factor JUN (the canonical target of JNK signaling) and the \nendoplasmic reticulum stress effector and transcription factor DNA damage \ninducible transcript 3 (DDIT3, also known as CHOP) have been shown to act \ndownstream of EDN receptors. Previous studies demonstrated that JUN and DDIT3 \nwere important regulators of RGC death after glaucoma-relevant injures. Here, we \ncharacterized EDN insult in vivo and investigated the role of JUN and DDIT3 in \nEDN-induced RGC death. To accomplish this, EDN1 ligand was intravitreally \ninjected into the eyes of wildtype, Six3-cre+Junfl/fl (Jun-/-), Ddit3 null \n(Ddit3-/-), and Ddit3-/-Jun-/- mice. Intravitreal EDN1 was sufficient to drive \nRGC death in vivo. EDN1 insult caused JUN activation in RGCs, and deletion of \nJun from the neural retina attenuated RGC death after EDN insult. However, \ndeletion of Ddit3 did not confer significant protection to RGCs after EDN1 \ninsult. These results indicate that EDN caused RGC death via a JUN-dependent \nmechanism. In addition, EDN signaling is known to elicit potent \nvasoconstriction. JUN signaling was shown to drive neuronal death after ischemic \ninsult. Therefore, the effects of intravitreal EDN1 on retinal vessel diameter \nand hypoxia were explored. Intravitreal EDN1 caused transient retinal \nvasoconstriction and regions of RGC and Müller glia hypoxia. Thus, it remains a \npossibility that EDN elicits a hypoxic insult to RGCs, causing apoptosis via \nJNK-JUN signaling. The importance of EDN-induced vasoconstriction and hypoxia in \ncausing RGC death after EDN insult and in models of glaucoma requires further \ninvestigation.",

We have previously shown that intracellular antigen flow cytometric \nanalysis of RIP3, Caspase-3 and cell viability dye allowed the determination of \nlevels of apoptosis (Caspase-3+ ve/RIP3- ve), necroptosis \n(RIP3Hi + ve/Caspase-3- ve) and RIP1-dependent apoptosis \n(Caspase-3+ ve/RIP3+ ve) in a single Jurkat cell population. The addition of \nmore intracellular markers allows the determination of the incidence of \nparthanatos (PARP), DNA Damage Response (DDR, H2AX), H2AX hyper-activation of \nPARP (H2AX/PARP) autophagy (LC3B) and ER stress (PERK), thus allowing the \nidentification of 124 sub-populations both within live and dead cell \npopulations. Shikonin simultaneously induced Jurkat cell apoptosis and \nnecroptosis the degree of which can be shown flow cytometrically together with \nthe effects of blockade of these forms of cell death by zVAD and necrostatin-1 \nhave on specific RCD populations including necroptosis, early and late apoptosis \nand RIP1-dependent apoptosis phenotypes in live and dead cells. Necrostatin-1 \nand zVAD was shown to modulate levels of shikonin induced DDR, hyper-action of \nPARP and parthanatos in the four forms of RCD processes analysed. LC3B was \nup-regulated by combined treatment of zVAD with chloroquine which also revealed \nthat DNA damage was reduced in live cells but enhanced in dead cells indicating \nthe role of autophagy in maintaining cell health. This approach to RCD research \nshould be a great advance to understanding the mechanisms of drugs and their \neffects upon RCD populations.",

However, the \nmolecular mechanisms related to CME remain largely elusive. Statins have been \nshown to prevent PMI, but the underlying mechanism has not been identified. \nHere, we examine whether the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to CME-induced \ncardiac injury and investigate the effects of statin therapy on CME. In vivo \nstudy, mice with CME were treated with 40 mg/kg/d rosuvastatin (RVS) orally or a \nselective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg/d). \nMice treated with MCC950 and RVS showed improved cardiac contractile function \nand morphological changes, diminished fibrosis and microinfarct size, and \nreduced serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Mechanistically, RVS decreased \nthe expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin-1β, and Gasdermin D N-terminal \ndomains. Proteomics analysis revealed that RVS restored the energy metabolism \nand oxidative phosphorylation in CME. Furthermore, reduced reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) level and alleviated mitochondrial damage were observed in \nRVS-treated mice. In vitro study, RVS inhibited the activation of NLRP3 \ninflammasome induced by tumor necrosis factor α plus hypoxia in H9c2 cells. \nMeanwhile, the pyroptosis was also suppressed by RVS, indicated by the increased \ncell viability, decreased LDH and propidium iodide uptake in H9c2 cells. RVS \nalso reduced the level of mitochondrial ROS generation in vitro. Our results \nindicate the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent cardiac pyroptosis plays an important \nrole in CME-induced cardiac injury and its inhibitor exerts cardioprotective \neffect following CME. We also uncover the anti-pyroptosis role of RVS in CME, \nwhich is associated with regulating mitochondrial ROS.",

            "TEXT": "GPD1 Enhances the Anticancer Effects of Metformin by Synergistically Increasing \nTotal Cellular Glycerol-3-Phosphate.\n\nMetformin is an oral drug widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes \nmellitus. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of metformin in cancer \ntreatment. However, for metformin to elicit effects on cancer often requires a \nhigh dosage, and any underlying mechanism for how to improve its inhibitory \neffects remains unknown. Here, we found that low mRNA expression of \nglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (GPD1) may predict a poor response to \nmetformin treatment in 15 cancer cell lines. In vitro and in vivo, metformin \ntreatment alone significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation, a phenotype \nenhanced by GPD1 overexpression. Total cellular glycerol-3-phosphate \nconcentration was significantly increased by the combination of GPD1 \noverexpression and metformin treatment, which suppressed cancer growth via \ninhibition of mitochondrial function. Eventually, increased reactive oxygen \nspecies and mitochondrial structural damage was observed in GPD1-overexpressing \ncell lines treated with metformin, which may contribute to cell death. In \nsummary, this study demonstrates that GPD1 overexpression enhances the \nanticancer activity of metformin and that patients with increased GPD1 \nexpression in tumor cells may respond better to metformin therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: \nGPD1 overexpression enhances the anticancer effect of metformin through \nsynergistic inhibition of mitochondrial function, thereby providing new insight \ninto metformin-mediated cancer therapy.",

At the genome level, p50 NF-κB promoted binding of \nSTAT1 to regulatory regions of selected IFNγ-dependent genes, including \ninducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2). In agreement, ablation of p50 as well as \npharmacologic inhibition of either the PGE2 receptor EP2 or NO production \nreprogrammed M-MDSCs toward a NOS2low/TNFαhigh phenotype, restoring the in vivo \nantitumor activity of IFNγ.

We report here that ZNF704, a gene mapped to 8q21, is \nrecurrently amplified in various malignancies including breast cancer. ZNF704 \nacted as a transcriptional repressor and interacted with the transcriptional \ncorepressor SIN3A complex. Genome-wide interrogation of transcriptional targets \nrevealed that the ZNF704/SIN3A complex represses a panel of genes including PER2 \nthat are critically involved in the function of the circadian clock. \nOverexpression of ZNF704 prolonged the period and dampened the amplitude of the \ncircadian clock.

            "TEXT": "Suppression of autophagy during mitosis via CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligases-mediated \nWIPI2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a cellular process in which cytosolic contents are \ndegraded by lysosome in response to various stress conditions. Apart from its \nrole in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, autophagy also involves in \nregulation of cell cycle progression under nutrient-deprivation conditions. \nHowever, whether and how autophagy is regulated by the cell cycle especially \nduring mitosis remains largely undefined. Here we show that WIPI2/ATG18B (WD \nrepeat domain, phosphoinositide interacting 2), an autophagy-related (ATG) \nprotein that plays a critical role in autophagosome biogenesis, is a direct \nsubstrate of CUL4-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL4s). Upon mitosis induction, CRL4s \nare activated via neddylation, and recruit WIPI2 via DDB1 (damage specific DNA \nbinding protein 1), leading to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of \nWIPI2 and suppression of autophagy. The WIPI2 protein level and autophagy during \nmitosis could be rescued by knockdown of CRL4s or treatment with \nMLN4924/Pevonedistat, a selective inhibitor of CRLs, via suppression of NAE1 \n(NEDD8 activating enzyme E1 subunit 1). Moreover, restoration of WIPI2 rescues \nautophagy during mitosis and leads to mitotic slippage and cell senescence. Our \nstudy thus discovers a novel function of CRL4s in autophagy by targeting WIPI2 \nfor polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation during mitosis.",

Macroautophagy/autophagy regulates many \nbiological processes, but the role of autophagy in microglial activation during \nPD development remains largely unclear. In this study, we showed that deletion \nof microglial Atg5 caused PD-like symptoms in mice, characterized by impairment \nin motor coordination and cognitive learning, loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) \nneurons, enhancement of neuroinflammation and reduction in dopamine levels in \nthe striatum. Mechanistically, we found that inhibition of autophagy led to \nNLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome activation via PDE10A \n(phosphodiesterase 10A)-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling in \nmicroglia, and the sequential upregulation of downstream IL1B/IL-1β in turn \nincreased the expression of MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor \n[glycosylation-inhibiting factor]), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Inhibition of \nNLRP3 inflammasome activation by administration of MCC950, a specific inhibitor \nfor NLRP3, decreased MIF expression and neuroinflammatory levels, and rescued \nthe loss of TH neurons in the substantial nigra (SN). Interestingly, we found \nthat serum MIF levels in PD patients were significantly elevated.

Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR \nscreening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) \nPOU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful \ndependency in a subset of SCLC lines. An analysis of human SCLC specimens \nrevealed that POU2F3 is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC tumors that lack \nexpression of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a \nchemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling \nexperiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell \nidentity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can \nbe classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, \nASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique dependencies in \nPOU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the \nreceptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). These \ndata reveal POU2F3 as a cell identity determinant and a dependency in a tuft \ncell-like variant of SCLC, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of \norigin or a trans-differentiation event in this disease.",

            "TEXT": "Chemotherapeutic paclitaxel and cisplatin differentially induce pyroptosis in \nA549 lung cancer cells via caspase-3/GSDME activation.\n\nGasdermin E (GSDME) has an important role in inducing secondary \nnecrosis/pyroptosis. Upon apoptotic stimulation, it can be cleaved by activated \ncaspase-3 to generate its N-terminal fragment (GSDME-NT), which executes \npyroptosis by perforating the plasma membrane. GSDME is expressed in many human \nlung cancers including A549 cells. Paclitaxel and cisplatin are two \nrepresentative chemotherapeutic agents for lung cancers, which induce apoptosis \nvia different action mechanisms. However, it remains unclear whether they can \ninduce GSDME-mediated secondary necrosis/pyroptosis in lung A549 cancer cells. \nHere we showed that both paclitaxel and cisplatin evidently induced apoptosis in \nA549 cells as revealed by the activation of multiple apoptotic markers. Notably, \nsome of the dying cells displayed characteristic morphology of secondary \nnecrosis/pyroptosis, by blowing large bubbles from the cellular membrane \naccompanied by caspase-3 activation and GSDME-NT generation. But the ability of \ncisplatin to induce this phenomenon was much stronger than that of paclitaxel. \nConsistent with this, cisplatin triggered much higher activation of caspase-3 \nand generation of GSDME-NT than paclitaxel, suggesting that the levels of \nsecondary necrosis/pyroptosis correlated with the levels of active caspase-3 and \nGSDME-NT. Supporting this, caspase-3 specific inhibitor (Ac-DEVD-CHO) suppressed \ncisplatin-induced GSDME-NT generation and concurrently reduced the secondary \nnecrosis/pyroptosis. Besides, GSDME knockdown significantly inhibited cisplatin- \nbut not paclitaxel-induced secondary necrosis/pyroptosis. These results \nindicated that cisplatin induced higher levels of secondary necrosis/pyroptosis \nin A549 cells than paclitaxel, suggesting that cisplatin may provide additional \nadvantages in the treatment of lung cancers with high levels of GSDME \nexpression.",

However acquired resistance to paclitaxel, epithelial \nto mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell formation are the major obstacles \nfor successful chemotherapy with this drug. Some of the major reasons behind \nchemoresistance development include increased ability of the cancer cells to \nsurvive under stress conditions by autophagy, increased expression of drug \nefflux pumps, tubulin mutations etc. In this study we found that inhibition of \nautophagy with chloroquine prevented development of paclitaxel resistance in \nA549 cells with time and potentiated the effect of paclitaxel by increased \naccumulation of superoxide-producing damaged mitochondria, with elevated ROS \ngeneration, it also increased the apoptotic rate and sub G0/ G1 phase arrest \nwith time in A549 cells treated with paclitaxel and attenuated the metastatic \npotential and cancer stem cell population of the paclitaxel-resistant cells by \nROS mediated modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, thereby \nincreasing paclitaxel sensitivity. ROS here played a crucial role in modulating \nAkt activity when autophagy process was hindered by chloroquine, excessive ROS \naccumulation in the cell inhibited Akt activity. In addition, chloroquine \npre-treatment followed by taxol (10 nM) treatment did not show significant \ntoxicity towards non-carcinomas WI38 cells (lung fibroblast cells). Thus \nautophagy inhibition by CQ pre-treatment can be used as a fruitful strategy to \ncombat the phenomenon of paclitaxel resistance development as well as metastasis \nin lung cancer.",

In \naddition to its role in mitochondrial membrane fusion, cristae structure, and \nbioenergetic function, OPA1 controls apoptosis by sequestering cytochrome c (cyt \nc) in mitochondrial cristae. Cleavage of functional long OPA1 (L-OPA1) isoforms \nby OMA1 inactivates mitochondrial fusion and primes apoptosis. OPA1 cleavage is \nregulated by the prohibitin (PHB) complex, a heteromeric, ring-shaped \nmitochondrial inner membrane scaffolding complex composed of PHB1 and PHB2. In \nneurons, PHB plays a protective role against various stresses, and PHB deletion \ndestabilizes OPA1 causing neurodegeneration. While deletion of OMA1 prevents \nOPA1 destabilization and attenuates neurodegeneration in PHB2 KO mice, how PHB \nlevels regulate OMA1 is still unknown. Here, we investigate the effects of \nmodulating neuronal PHB levels on OMA1 stability and OPA1 cleavage. We \ndemonstrate that PHB promotes OMA1 turnover, effectively decreasing the pool of \nOMA1. Further, we show that OMA1 binds to cardiolipin (CL), a major \nmitochondrial phospholipid. CL binding promotes OMA1 turnover, as we show that \ndeleting the CL-binding domain of OMA1 decreases its turnover rate. Since PHB is \nknown to stabilize CL, these data suggest that PHB modulates OMA1 through CL. \nFurthermore, we show that PHB decreases cyt c release induced by tBID and \nattenuates caspase 9 activation in response to hypoxic stress in neurons. Taken \ntogether, our results suggest that PHB-mediated CL stabilization regulates \nstress responses and cell death through OMA1 turnover and cyt c release.",

In this study, we focus on Ataxin-1 (ATXN1), a \ndosage-sensitive gene involved in the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar \nataxia type 1 (SCA1). While the precise maintenance of ATXN1 levels is essential \nto prevent disease, the mechanisms that regulate ATXN1 expression remain largely \nunknown. We demonstrate that ATXN1's unusually long 5' untranslated region (5' \nUTR) negatively regulates its expression via posttranscriptional mechanisms. \nBased on recent reports that microRNAs (miRNAs) can interact with both 3' and 5' \nUTRs to regulate their target genes, we identify miR760 as a negative regulator \nthat binds to a conserved site in ATXN1's 5' UTR to induce RNA degradation and \ntranslational inhibition. We found that delivery of Adeno-associated virus \n(AAV)-expressing miR760 in the cerebellum reduces ATXN1 levels in vivo and \nmitigates motor coordination deficits in a mouse model of SCA1. These findings \nprovide new insights into the regulation of ATXN1 levels, present additional \nevidence for miRNA-mediated gene regulation via 5' UTR binding, and raise the \npossibility that noncoding mutations in the ATXN1 locus may act as risk factors \nfor yet to be discovered progressive ataxias.",

Pathogenic variants in the \nessential gene BRCA2/FANCD1, when monoallelic, predispose to breast and ovarian \ncancer, and when biallelic, result in a severe subtype of Fanconi anemia. BRCA2 \nfunction in the FA pathway is attributed to its role as a mediator of the RAD51 \nrecombinase in HR repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). BRCA2 and \nRAD51 functions are also required to protect stalled replication forks from \nnucleolytic degradation during response to hydroxyurea (HU). While RAD51 has \nbeen shown to be necessary in the early steps of ICL repair to prevent aberrant \nnuclease resection, the role of BRCA2 in this process has not been described. \nHere, based on the analysis of BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (DBD) mutants \n(c.8488-1G>A and c.8524C>T) discovered in FA patients presenting with atypical \nFA-like phenotypes, we establish that BRCA2 is necessary for the protection of \nDNA at ICLs.

BRCA2 function at an ICL protects against DNA2-WRN \nnuclease-helicase complex and not the MRE11 nuclease that is implicated in the \nresection of HU-induced stalled replication forks. Our results also indicate \nthat unlike the processing at HU-induced stalled forks, the function of the SNF2 \ntranslocases (SMARCAL1, ZRANB3, or HLTF), implicated in fork reversal, are not \nan integral component of the ICL repair, pointing to a different mechanism of \nfork protection at different DNA lesions.",

Emerging data are showing that hypusinated EIF5A \nregulates key cellular processes such as autophagy, senescence, polyamine \nhomeostasis, energy metabolism, and plays a role in cancer.

Nevertheless, the impact of \nscutellarin on IPF and the downstream molecular mechanism remain unclear. In \nthis study, scutellarin suppressed BLM-induced inflammation via NF-κB/NLRP3 \npathway both in vivo and in vitro.

The expression levels of \nEMT-related markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin, matrix \nmetalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, were increased in BLM group, and \nsuppressed by scutellarin.

Previously, we have identified fenretinide \n(retinoic acid p-hydroxyanilide) to affect PAX3-FOXO1 expression levels as well \nas FP-RMS cell viability. Here, we characterize the mode of action of \nfenretinide in more detail. First, we demonstrate that fenretinide-induced \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) depends on complex II of the \nmitochondrial respiratory chain, since ROS scavenging as well as complexing of \niron completely abolished cell death. Second, we co-treated cells with a range \nof pharmacological inhibitors of specific cell death pathways including z-vad \n(apoptosis), necrostatin-1 (necroptosis), 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (autophagy), \nand ferrostatin-1 (ferroptosis) together with fenretinide. Surprisingly, none of \nthese inhibitors was able to prevent cell death. Also genetic depletion of key \nplayers in the apoptotic and necroptotic pathway (BAK, BAX, and RIPK1) confirmed \nthe pharmacological data. Interestingly however, electron microscopy of \nfenretinide-treated cells revealed an excessive accumulation of cytoplasmic \nvacuoles, which were distinct from autophagosomes. Further flow cytometry and \nfluorescence microscopy experiments suggested a hyperstimulation of \nmacropinocytosis, leading to an accumulation of enlarged early and late \nendosomes. Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition as well as genetic depletion \nof large dynamin GTPases completely abolished fenretinide-induced vesicle \nformation and subsequent cell death, suggesting a new form of dynamin-dependent \nprogrammed cell death. Taken together, our data identify a new form of cell \ndeath mediated through the production of ROS by fenretinide treatment, \nhighlighting the value of this compound for treatment of sarcoma patients \nincluding FP-RMS.",

However, no natural small-molecule \ncompounds with cancer inhibitory activity have been identified to date. In the \npresent study, we reported the discovery of a novel ferroptosis inducer, \ntalaroconvolutin A (TalaA), and the underlying molecular mechanism. We \ndiscovered that TalaA killed colorectal cancer cells in dose-dependent and \ntime-dependent manners. Interestingly, TalaA did not induce apoptosis, but \nstrongly triggered ferroptosis. Notably, TalaA was significantly more effective \nthan erastin (a well-known ferroptosis inducer) in suppressing colorectal cancer \ncells via ferroptosis. We revealed a dual mechanism of TalaA' action against \ncancer. On the one hand, TalaA considerably increased reactive oxygen species \nlevels to a certain threshold, the exceeding of which induced ferroptosis. On \nthe other hand, this compound downregulated the expression of the channel \nprotein solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) but upregulated arachidonate \nlipoxygenase 3 (ALOXE3), promoting ferroptosis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments \nin mice evidenced that TalaA effectively suppressed the growth of xenografted \ncolorectal cancer cells without obvious liver and kidney toxicities. The \nfindings of this study indicated that TalaA could be a new potential powerful \ndrug candidate for colorectal cancer therapy due to its outstanding ability to \nkill colorectal cancer cells via ferroptosis induction.",

TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB)-mediated induction of ALP has been recently considered as the common \nmechanism in ameliorating the pathological lesion of myocardial ischemia and \nneurodegenerative diseases. Here we explored the vital role of TFEB in permanent \nmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)-mediated dysfunction of ALP and \nischemic insult in rats. The results showed that ALP function was first enhanced \nin the early stage of the ischemic process, especially in neurons of the cortex, \nand this was accompanied by increased TFEB expression and translocation to the \nnucleus, which was mediated at least in part through activation by \nPPP3/calcineurin. At the later stages of ischemia, a gradual decrease in the \nlevel of nuclear TFEB was coupled with a progressive decline in lysosomal \nactivity, accumulation of autophagosomes and autophagy substrates, and \nexacerbation of the ischemic injury. Notably, neuron-specific overexpression of \nTFEB significantly enhanced ALP function and rescued the ischemic damage, \nstarting as early as 6 h and even lasting to 48 h after ischemia. Furthermore, \nneuron-specific knockdown of TFEB markedly reversed the activation of ALP and \nfurther aggravated the neurological deficits and ischemic outcome at the early \nstage of pMCAO. These results highlight neuronal-targeted TFEB as one of the key \nplayers in the pMCAO-mediated dysfunction of ALP and ischemic injury, and \nidentify TFEB as a promising target for therapies aimed at neuroprotection in \ncerebral ischemia.",

            "TEXT": "Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 Promotes pICln-Dependent Androgen Receptor \nTranscription in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.\n\nThe majority of advanced prostate cancer therapies aim to inhibit androgen \nreceptor (AR) signaling. However, AR reactivation inevitably drives disease \nprogression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here we demonstrate \nthat protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) functions as an epigenetic \nactivator of AR transcription in CRPC, requiring cooperation with a methylosome \nsubunit pICln. In vitro and in xenograft tumors in mice, targeting PRMT5 or \npICln suppressed growth of CRPC cells. Full-length AR and AR-V7 transcription \nactivation required both PRMT5 and pICln but not MEP50. This activation of \ntranscription was accompanied by PRMT5-mediated symmetric dimethylation of H4R3 \nat the proximal AR promoter. Further, knockdown of PRMT5 abolished the binding \nof pICln (but not vice versa) to the AR proximal promoter region, suggesting \nthat PRMT5 recruits pICln to the AR promoter to activate AR transcription. \nDifferential gene expression analysis in 22Rv1 cells confirmed that PRMT5 and \npICln both regulate the androgen signaling pathway. In addition, PRMT5 and pICln \nprotein expression positively correlated with AR and AR-V7 protein expression in \nCRPC tissues and their expression was highly correlated at the mRNA level across \nmultiple publicly available CRPC datasets. Our results suggest that targeting \nPRMT5 or pICln may be explored as a novel therapy for CRPC treatment by \nsuppressing expression of AR and AR splice variants to circumvent AR \nreactivation.",

Here, we report that extracellular KRASG12D is essential for pancreatic \ntumor-associated macrophage polarization. Oxidative stress induces KRASG12D \nprotein release from cancer cells succumbing to autophagy-dependent ferroptosis. \nExtracellular KRASG12D packaged into exosomes then is taken up by macrophages \nthrough an AGER-dependent mechanism. KRASG12D causes macrophages to switch to an \nM2-like pro-tumor phenotype via STAT3-dependent fatty acid oxidation. \nConsequently, the disruption of KRASG12D release and uptake can abolish the \nmacrophage-mediated stimulation of pancreatic adenocarcinomas in mouse models. \nImportantly, the level of KRASG12D expression in macrophages correlates with \npoor survival in pancreatic cancer patients. These findings not only identify \nextracellular KRASG12D as a key mediator of cancer cell-macrophage \ncommunication, but also provide a novel KRAS-targeted anticancer strategy.",

Moreover, PPARγ is \nrequired for macrophage respiration even in the absence of exogenous ligand. \nUnexpectedly, the absence of PPARγ dramatically affects the oxidation of \nglutamine. Both glutamine and PPARγ have been implicated in alternative \nactivation (AA) of macrophages, and PPARγ was required for interleukin 4 \n(IL4)-dependent gene expression and stimulation of macrophage respiration. \nIndeed, unstimulated macrophages lacking PPARγ contained elevated levels of the \ninflammation-associated metabolite itaconate and express a proinflammatory \ntranscriptome that, remarkably, phenocopied that of macrophages depleted of \nglutamine. Thus, PPARγ functions as a checkpoint, guarding against inflammation, \nand is permissive for AA by facilitating glutamine metabolism. However, PPARγ \nexpression is itself markedly increased by IL4.

Although CAFs impact the aggressive \ncharacteristics of gastric cancer cells, the contribution of CAF-EV to gastric \ncancer progression has not been elucidated. Here, we investigated the molecular \nmechanism of the changes in gastric cancer characteristics induced by CAF-EV. \nCAF abundance in gastric cancer tissues was associated with poor prognosis of \npatients with gastric cancer receiving chemotherapy. Moreover, CAF-EV induced \ntubular network formation and drug resistance of gastric cancer cells in the \nextracellular matrix (ECM). Comprehensive proteomic analysis of CAF-EV \nidentified that Annexin A6 plays a pivotal role in network formation and drug \nresistance of gastric cancer cells in the ECM via activation of β1 \nintegrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-YAP. A peritoneal metastasis mouse model \nrevealed that CAF-EV induced drug resistance in peritoneal tumors, and \ninhibition of FAK or YAP efficiently attenuated gastric cancer drug resistance \nin vitro and in vivo. These findings demonstrate that drug resistance is \nconferred by Annexin A6 in CAF-EV and provide a potential avenue for overcoming \ngastric cancer drug resistance through the inhibition of FAK-YAP signaling in \ncombination with conventional chemotherapeutics.",

            "TEXT": "(+)-Clausenamide protects against drug-induced liver injury by inhibiting \nhepatocyte ferroptosis.\n\nDrug-induced liver injury is the major cause of acute liver failure. However, \nthe underlying mechanisms seem to be multifaceted and remain poorly understood, \nresulting in few effective therapies. Here, we report a novel mechanism that \ncontributes to acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity through the induction of \nferroptosis, a distinctive form of programmed cell death. We subsequently \nidentified therapies protective against acetaminophen-induced liver damage and \nfound that (+)-clausenamide ((+)-CLA), an active alkaloid isolated from the \nleaves of Clausena lansium (Lour.) Skeels, inhibited acetaminophen-induced \nhepatocyte ferroptosis both in vivo and in vitro. Consistently, (+)-CLA \nsignificantly alleviated acetaminophen-induced or erastin-induced hepatic \npathological damages, hepatic dysfunctions and excessive production of lipid \nperoxidation both in cultured hepatic cell lines and mouse liver. Furthermore, \ntreatment with (+)-CLA reduced the mRNA level of prostaglandin endoperoxide \nsynthase 2 while it increased the protein level of glutathione peroxidase 4 in \nhepatocytes and mouse liver, confirming that the inhibition of ferroptosis \ncontributes to the protective effect of (+)-CLA on drug-induced liver damage. We \nfurther revealed that (+)-CLA specifically reacted with the Cys-151 residue of \nKeap1, which blocked Nrf2 ubiquitylation and resulted in an increased Nrf2 \nstability, thereby leading to the activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway to \nprevent drug-induced hepatocyte ferroptosis. Our studies illustrate the \ninnovative mechanisms of acetaminophen-induced liver damage and present a novel \nintervention strategy to treat drug overdose by using (+)-CLA.",

Searching for strategies that would extend the \nuse of PARP inhibitors to BRCA1-proficient tumors, we found that the stability \nof BRCA1 protein following ionizing radiation (IR) is maintained by \npostphosphorylational prolyl-isomerization adjacent to Ser1191 of BRCA1, \ncatalyzed by prolyl-isomerase Pin1. Extinction of Pin1 decreased homologous \nrecombination (HR) to the level of BRCA1-deficient cells. Pin1 stabilizes BRCA1 \nby preventing ubiquitination of Lys1037 of BRCA1. Loss of Pin1, or introduction \nof a BRCA1-mutant refractory to Pin1 binding, decreased the ability of BRCA1 to \nlocalize to repair foci and augmented IR-induced DNA damage. In vitro growth of \nHR-proficient breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer cells were modestly \nrepressed by olaparib or Pin1 inhibition using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), \nwhile combination treatment resulted in near-complete block of cell \nproliferation.

However, the \nenzymes involved in the regulation of BCL2A1 protein stability are currently \nunknown. Here, we provide the first insight into the regulation of BCL2A1 \nubiquitination. We present evidence that TRIM28 is an E3 ubiquitin-ligase for \nBCL2A1. Indeed, endogenous TRIM28 and BCL2A1 bind to each other at the \nmitochondria and TRIM28 knock-down decreases BCL2A1 ubiquitination. We also show \nthat TRIM17 stabilizes BCL2A1 by blocking TRIM28 from binding and ubiquitinating \nBCL2A1, and that GSK3 is involved in the phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of \nBCL2A1 degradation. BCL2A1 and its close relative MCL1 are thus regulated by \ncommon factors but with opposite outcome. Finally, overexpression of TRIM28 or \nknock-out of TRIM17 reduced BCLA1 protein levels and restored sensitivity of \nmelanoma cells to BRAF-targeted therapy. Therefore, our data describe a \nmolecular rheostat in which two proteins of the TRIM family antagonistically \nregulate BCL2A1 stability and modulate cell death.",

During the reperfusion process, \ninflammation and tissue injury were triggered, which were mediated by \nimmunocytes and cytokines. However, the mechanisms initiating I/R-induced \ninflammation and driving immunocytes activation remained largely unknown. In \nthis study, we identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-H19 as the key onset of \nI/R-induced inflammation. We found that I/R increased lncRNA-H19 expression to \nsignificantly promote NLRP3/6 inflammasome imbalance and resulted in microglial \npyroptosis, cytokines overproduction, and neuronal death. These damages were \neffectively inhibited by lncRNA-H19 knockout. Specifically, lncRNA-H19 \nfunctioned via sponging miR-21 to facilitate PDCD4 expression and formed a \ncompeting endogenous RNA network (ceRNET) in ischemic cascade. LncRNA \nH19/miR-21/PDCD4 ceRNET can directly regulate I/R-induced sterile inflammation \nand neuronal lesion in vivo. We thus propose that lncRNA-H19 is a previously \nunknown danger signals in the molecular and immunological pathways of I/R \ninjury, and pharmacological approaches to inhibit H19 seem likely to become \ntreatment modalities for patients in the near future based on these mechanistic \nfindings.",

To explore the molecular mechanisms of autophagy, we performed a \ncell-based functional screening with SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing GFP-LC3, \nusing an siRNA library and identified TMED10 (transmembrane p24 trafficking \nprotein 10), previously known as the γ-secretase-modulating protein, as a novel \nregulator of autophagy. Further investigations revealed that depletion of TMED10 \ninduced the activation of autophagy. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction \nassays showed that TMED10 directly binds to ATG4B (autophagy related gene 4B \ncysteine peptidase), and the interaction is diminished under autophagy \nactivation conditions such as rapamycin treatment and serum deprivation. In \naddition, inhibition of TMED10 significantly enhanced the proteolytic activity \nof ATG4B for LC3 cleavage. Importantly, the expression of TMED10 in AD \n(Alzheimer disease) patients was considerably decreased, and downregulation of \nTMED10 increased amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Treatment with Aβ increased ATG4B \nproteolytic activity as well as dissociation of TMED10 and ATG4B.

Additionally, SLC7a11 inhibitors Erastin and Sorafenib \nreduce infection.

To \ntest the role of KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo, we developed a \nCRISPR/Cas9-based mouse model of SCLC by delivering an adenovirus (or an \nadeno-associated virus [AAV]) that expresses Cre recombinase and sgRNAs \ntargeting Rb1, Tp53, and Rbl2 into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox Cas9 mice. \nCoinclusion of a KDM5A sgRNA decreased SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and \nthe SCLCs that formed despite the absence of KDM5A had higher NOTCH activity \ncompared to KDM5A +/+ SCLCs.

Long \nnoncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in inflammation, but the exact mechanism in \natherosclerosis is unclear. Our microarray analyses revealed that the levels of \nlncRNA-FA2H-2 were significantly decreased by oxidized low-density lipoprotein \n(OX-LDL). Bioinformatics analyses indicated that mixed lineage kinase \ndomain-like protein (MLKL) might be regulated by lncRNA-FA2H-2. In vitro \nexperiments showed that lncRNA-FA2H-2 interacted with the promoter of the MLKL \ngene, downregulated MLKL expression, and the binding sites between -750 and 471 \nwere necessary for lncRNA-FA2H-2 responsiveness to MLKL. Silencing lncRNA-FA2H-2 \nand overexpression of MLKL could activate inflammation and inhibited autophagy \nflux. Both lncRNA-FA2H-2 knockdown and overexpression of MLKL could \nsignificantly aggravate inflammatory responses induced by OX-LDL. We found that \nthe 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and Atg7-shRNA enhanced inflammatory responses \ninduced by knockdown of lncRNA-FA2H-2 and overexpression of MLKL. We \ndemonstrated that the effects of MLKL on autophagy might be associated with a \nmechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling pathways. In vivo \nexperiments with apoE knockout mice fed a western diet demonstrated that \nLncRNA-FA2H-2 knockdown decreased microtubule-associated expression of \nmicrotubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 II and lysosome-associated \nmembrane protein 1, but increased expression of sequestosome 1 (p62), MLKL, \nvascular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and \ninterleukin-6 in atherosclerotic lesions. Our findings indicated that the \nlncRNA-FA2H-2-MLKL pathway is essential for regulation of autophagy and \ninflammation, and suggested that lncRNA-FA2H-2 and MLKL could act as potential \ntherapeutic targets to ameliorate atherosclerosis-related diseases.",

The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) \ncomplex plays a pivotal role in transcription inhibition at DSBs by stimulating \nproteasome-dependent eviction of RNAPII at these lesions. How DNA-PK triggers \nRNAPII eviction to inhibit transcription at DSBs remains unclear. Here we show \nthat the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2 associates with components of the DNA-PK \nand RNAPII complexes and is recruited to DSBs at RNAPII transcribed genes. In \nresponse to DSBs, WWP2 targets the RNAPII subunit RPB1 for K48-linked \nubiquitylation, thereby driving DNA-PK- and proteasome-dependent eviction of \nRNAPII. The lack of WWP2 or expression of nonubiquitylatable RPB1 abrogates the \nbinding of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) factors, including DNA-PK and \nXRCC4/DNA ligase IV, and impairs DSB repair. These findings suggest that WWP2 \noperates in a DNA-PK-dependent shutoff circuitry for RNAPII clearance that \npromotes DSB repair by protecting the NHEJ machinery from collision with the \ntranscription machinery.",

However, while arrested, senescent cells secrete a variety of \nproteins collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype \n(SASP), which can reinforce the arrest and induce senescence in a paracrine \nmanner. However, the SASP has also been shown to favor embryonic development, \nwound healing, and even tumor growth, suggesting more complex physiological \nroles than currently understood. Here we uncover timely new functions of the \nSASP in promoting a proregenerative response through the induction of cell \nplasticity and stemness. We show that primary mouse keratinocytes transiently \nexposed to the SASP exhibit increased expression of stem cell markers and \nregenerative capacity in vivo. However, prolonged exposure to the SASP causes a \nsubsequent cell-intrinsic senescence arrest to counter the continued \nregenerative stimuli. Finally, by inducing senescence in single cells in vivo in \nthe liver, we demonstrate that this activates tissue-specific expression of stem \ncell markers. Together, this work uncovers a primary and beneficial role for the \nSASP in promoting cell plasticity and tissue regeneration and introduces the \nconcept that transient therapeutic delivery of senescent cells could be \nharnessed to drive tissue regeneration.",

Inflammasomes are thought to be especially \nrelevant to immune homeostasis, and their dysregulation contributes to \ninflammation and NDDs. However, few agents have been clinically shown to reduce \nNDD incidence by targeting inflammasomes. Our study indicated that NLRP3 (NLR \nfamily, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome is involved in Parkinson disease \n(PD) progression in patients and various murine models. In addition, the small \nmolecule kaempferol (Ka) protected mice against LPS- and SNCA-induced \nneurodegeneration by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation as evidenced by \nthe fact that Ka reduced cleaved CASP1 expression and disrupted \nNLRP3-PYCARD-CASP1 complex assembly with concomitant decreased IL1B secretion. \nMechanically, Ka promoted macroautophagy/autophagy in microglia, leading to \nreduced NLRP3 protein expression, which in turn deactivated the NLRP3 \ninflammasome. Intriguingly, ubiquitination was involved in Ka-induced autophagic \nNLRP3 degradation. These findings were further confirmed in vivo as knockdown of \nAtg5 expression or autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly inhibited the \nKa-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and neurodegeneration amelioration. \nThus, we demonstrated that Ka promotes neuroinflammatory inhibition via the \ncooperation of ubiquitination and autophagy, suggesting that Ka is a promising \ntherapeutic strategy for the treatment of NDDs.",

Seminal studies have shown that \nthe proto-oncogene MYC promotes metabolic reprogramming by altering glutamine \nuptake and metabolism in cancer cells. How MYC regulates the metabolism of other \namino acids in cancer is not fully understood. Using high-performance liquid \nchromatography (HPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we found that MYC \nincreased intracellular levels of tryptophan and tryptophan metabolites in the \nkynurenine pathway. MYC induced the expression of the tryptophan transporters \nSLC7A5 and SLC1A5 and the enzyme arylformamidase (AFMID), involved in the \nconversion of tryptophan into kynurenine. SLC7A5, SLC1A5, and AFMID were \nelevated in colon cancer cells and tissues, and kynurenine was significantly \ngreater in tumor samples than in the respective adjacent normal tissue from \npatients with colon cancer. Compared with normal human colonic epithelial cells, \ncolon cancer cells were more sensitive to the depletion of tryptophan. Blocking \nenzymes in the kynurenine pathway caused preferential death of established colon \ncancer cells and transformed colonic organoids. We found that only kynurenine \nand no other tryptophan metabolite promotes the nuclear translocation of the \ntranscription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Blocking the interaction \nbetween AHR and kynurenine with CH223191 reduced the proliferation of colon \ncancer cells.

            "TEXT": "FGF Trapping Inhibits Multiple Myeloma Growth through c-Myc Degradation-Induced \nMitochondrial Oxidative Stress.\n\nMultiple myeloma, the second most common hematologic malignancy, frequently \nrelapses because of chemotherapeutic resistance. Fibroblast growth factors (FGF) \nact as proangiogenic and mitogenic cytokines in multiple myeloma. Here, we \ndemonstrate that the autocrine FGF/FGFR axis is essential for multiple myeloma \ncell survival and progression by protecting multiple myeloma cells from \noxidative stress-induced apoptosis. In keeping with the hypothesis that the \nintracellular redox status can be a target for cancer therapy, FGF/FGFR blockade \nby FGF trapping or tyrosine kinase inhibitor impaired the growth and \ndissemination of multiple myeloma cells by inducing mitochondrial oxidative \nstress, DNA damage, and apoptotic cell death that were prevented by the \nantioxidant vitamin E or mitochondrial catalase overexpression. In addition, \nmitochondrial oxidative stress occurred as a consequence of proteasomal \ndegradation of the c-Myc oncoprotein that led to glutathione depletion. \nAccordingly, expression of a proteasome-nondegradable c-Myc protein mutant was \nsufficient to avoid glutathione depletion and rescue the proapoptotic effects \ndue to FGF blockade. These findings were confirmed on bortezomib-resistant \nmultiple myeloma cells as well as on bone marrow-derived primary multiple \nmyeloma cells from newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory patients, including \nplasma cells bearing the t(4;14) translocation obtained from patients with \nhigh-risk multiple myeloma. Altogether, these findings dissect the mechanism by \nwhich the FGF/FGFR system plays a nonredundant role in multiple myeloma cell \nsurvival and disease progression, and indicate that FGF targeting may represent \na therapeutic approach for patients with multiple myeloma with poor prognosis \nand advanced disease stage.",

Protective \nmitophagy delays the progression of vascular calcification. We previously \nreported that lactate accelerates osteoblastic phenotype transition of VSMC \nthrough BNIP3-mediated mitophagy suppression. In this study, we investigated the \nspecific links between lactate, mitochondrial homeostasis, and vascular \ncalcification. Ex vivo, alizarin S red and von Kossa staining in addition to \nmeasurement of calcium content, RUNX2, and BMP-2 protein levels revealed that \nlactate accelerated arterial media calcification. We demonstrated that lactate \ninduced mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in aortas, whereas mitophagy was \nsuppressed. In VSMCs, lactate increased NR4A1 expression, leading to activation \nof DNA-PKcs and p53. Lactate induced Drp1 migration to the mitochondria and \nenhanced mitochondrial fission through NR4A1. Western blot analysis of LC3-II \nand p62 and mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenovirus detection showed that NR4A1 knockdown was \ninvolved in enhanced autophagy flux. Furthermore, NR4A1 inhibited BNIP3-related \nmitophagy, which was confirmed by TOMM20 and BNIP3 protein levels, and LC3-II \nco-localization with TOMM20. The excessive fission and deficient mitophagy \ndamaged mitochondrial structure and impaired respiratory function, determined by \nmPTP opening rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial morphology \nunder TEM, ATP production, and OCR, which was reversed by NR4A1 silencing. \nMechanistically, lactate enhanced fission but halted mitophagy via activation of \nthe NR4A1/DNA-PKcs/p53 pathway, evoking apoptosis, finally accelerating \nosteoblastic phenotype transition of VSMC and calcium deposition. This study \nsuggests that the NR4A1/DNA-PKcs/p53 pathway is involved in the mechanism by \nwhich lactate accelerates vascular calcification, partly through excessive \nDrp-mediated mitochondrial fission and BNIP3-related mitophagy deficiency.",

Here, we investigated the interaction of SH2D4A and STAT3 to shed \nlight on the non-canonical functions of STAT3 in cooperation with the tumor \nsuppressor SH2D4A. Using an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) \napproach, we identified the mitochondrial scaffold proteins prohibitin 1 (PHB1) \nand prohibitin 2 (PHB2) among other proteins to potentially bind to SH2D4A. \nCo-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays confirmed direct \ninteractions of STAT3, PHB1, and SH2D4A in situ and in vitro. In addition, cell \nfractionation and immunofluorescence staining revealed co-localization of these \nproteins with mitochondria. These interactions were selectively interrupted by \nthe small molecule and PHB ligand FL3. Furthermore, FL3 led to a reduction of \nSTAT3 protein levels, STAT3 transcriptional activity, and HIF1α protein \nstabilization upon dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) treatment. Besides, \nmitochondrial fusion and fission markers, L-OPA1, Mfn1, and FIS1, were \ndysregulated upon FL3 treatment. This dysregulated morphology was accompanied by \nsignificant reduction of mitochondrial respiration, thus, FL3 significantly \ndiminished mitochondrial respirational capacity. In contrast, SH2D4A knockout \nincreased mitochondrial respiration, whereas FL3 reversed the effect of SH2D4A \nknockout. The here described results indicate that the interaction of SH2D4A and \nPHB1 is involved in the mitochondrial function and integrity. The demonstrated \ninteraction with STAT3, accompanied by its reduction of transcriptional \nactivity, further suggests that SH2D4A is linking STAT3 to its mitochondrial \nfunctions, and inhibition of PHB-interaction may have therapeutic effects in \ntumor cells with STAT3 activation.",

We further show that regulation of \ndecapping by 4E-T participates in mRNA repression by the miRNA effector protein \nTNRC6B and that 4E-T overexpression interferes with tristetraprolin (TTP)- and \nNOT1-mediated mRNA decay. Thus, we postulate that 4E-T modulates 5'-to-3' decay \nby swapping the fate of a deadenylated mRNA from complete degradation to \nstorage.

Also, mutants that abolish STING dimerization and \ncGAMP-binding diminished the STING-LC3 interaction and subsequent autophagy, \nsuggesting that STING activation is indispensable for autophagy induction. Our \nresults thus uncover dual functions of STING in activating the immune response \nand autophagy, and suggest that STING is involved in ensuring a measured innate \nimmune response.",

Thus, any agent that can induce \napoptosis may be useful for cancer treatment and apoptosis induction is arguably \nthe most potent defense against cancer promotion. In our previous studies, \n2-aryl benzimidazole conjugates were synthesized and evaluated for their \nantiproliferative activity and one of the new molecule (2f) was considered as a \npotential lead. This lead molecule showed significant antiproliferative activity \nagainst human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. The results of the present study \nrevealed that this compound arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase. Topoisomerase \nII inhibition assay and Western blot analysis suggested that this compound \neffectively inhibits topoisomerase II activity which leads to apoptotic cell \ndeath. Apoptosis induction in MCF-7 cells was further confirmed by loss of \nmitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm), release of cytochrome c from \nmitochondria, an increase in the level of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS), up regulation of proapoptotic \nprotein Bax and down regulation of anti apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Apoptosis assay \nusing Annexin V-FITC assay also suggested that this compound induced cell death \nby apoptosis. However, compound 2f induced apoptosis could not be reversed by \nZ-VAD-FMK (a pan-caspase inhibitor) demonstrated that the 2f induced apoptosis \nwas caspase independent. Further, 2f treatment did not activate caspase-7 and \ncaspase-9 activity, suggesting that this compound induced apoptosis in breast \ncancer cells via a caspase independent pathway. Most importantly, this compound \nwas less toxic towards non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A. \nFurthermore, docking studies also support the potentiality of this molecule to \nbind to the DNA topoisomerase II.",

Levels of \nextracellular Sona were decreased in both arrm7 and arr2 null clones, \ndemonstrating that Arr increases the level of extracellular Sona. Indeed, Arr \nbut not Arrm7, increased levels of Sona in cytoplasm and exosome fraction by \ninhibiting the lysosomal degradation pathway. Interestingly, Arr itself was \nidentified in the exosome fraction, demonstrating that Arr is secreted to \nextracellular space. When Sona-expressing S2 cells were treated with exosomal \nArr, the extracellular level of active Sona was increased. These results show \nthat exosomal Arr dictates Sona-expressing cells to increase the level of \nextracellular Sona. This new function of Arr occurred in the absence of Wg \nbecause S2 cells do not express Wg. We propose that Arr plays two distinct \nroles, one as an exosomal protein to increase the level of extracellular Sona in \na Wnt-independent manner and the other as a Wg co-receptor in a Wnt-dependent \nmanner.",

It has been perplexing as to why both enzymatically \nactivating and inactivating mutations in PTPN11 result in human developmental \ndisorders with overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we uncover a common \nliquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) behavior shared by these \ndisease-associated SHP2 mutants. SHP2 LLPS is mediated by the conserved \nwell-folded PTP domain through multivalent electrostatic interactions and \nregulated by an intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanism through conformational \nchanges. SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of SHP2 mutants, which \nboosts SHP2 PTP activity. Moreover, disease-associated SHP2 mutants can recruit \nand activate wild-type (WT) SHP2 in LLPS to promote MAPK activation. These \nresults not only suggest that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism \ninvolved in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases but also provide \nevidence that PTP may be regulated by LLPS that can be therapeutically targeted.",

            "TEXT": "Quantifying the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors on CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells \nfor immunotherapeutic applications via single-cell interaction.\n\nThe inhibition of the PD1/PDL1 pathway has led to remarkable clinical success \nfor cancer treatment in some patients. Many, however, exhibit little to no \nresponse to this treatment. To increase the efficacy of PD1 inhibition, \nadditional checkpoint inhibitors are being explored as combination therapy \noptions. TSR-042 and TSR-033 are novel antibodies for the inhibition of the PD1 \nand LAG3 pathways, respectively, and are intended for combination therapy. Here, \nwe explore the effect on cellular interactions of TSR-042 and TSR-033 alone and \nin combination at the single-cell level. Utilizing our droplet microfluidic \nplatform, we use time-lapse microscopy to observe the effects of these \nantibodies on calcium flux in CD8+ T cells upon antigen presentation, as well as \ntheir effect on the cytotoxic potential of CD8+ T cells on human breast cancer \ncells. This platform allowed us to investigate the interactions between these \ntreatments and their impacts on T-cell activity in greater detail than \npreviously applied in vitro tests. The novel parameters we were able to observe \nincluded effects on the exact time to target cell killing, contact times, and \npotential for serial-killing by CD8+ T cells. We found that inhibition of LAG3 \nwith TSR-033 resulted in a significant increase in calcium fluctuations of CD8+ \nT cells in contact with dendritic cells. We also found that the combination of \nTSR-042 and TSR-033 appears to synergistically increase tumor cell killing and \nthe single-cell level. This study provides a novel single-cell-based assessment \nof the impact these checkpoint inhibitors have on cellular interactions with \nCD8+ T cells.",

We \nestablished that UBR2-dependent protection from CICD was mediated by the \nMAPK/Erk pathway. We then observed that UBR2 is overexpressed in several \ncancers, especially in breast cancers and contributes to CICD resistance. \nTherefore, our work defines UBR2 as a novel regulator of CICD, found \noverexpressed in cancer cells, suggesting that its targeting may represent an \ninnovative way to kill tumor cells.",

However, the molecular mechanism by which macrophage-derived \ncytokines foster immune escape of colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. Here, we \ndemonstrated that macrophage infiltration induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or \na high-cholesterol diet (HCD) significantly promoted CRC growth. Similarly, LPS \nand poly (I:C) remarkably increased the volume of CT26 cell allograft tumors. \nC-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), which is secreted by macrophages, inhibited \nT-cell-mediated killing of HT29 cells and promoted immune escape by stabilizing \nPD-L1 in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CCL5 resulted in formation of \nnuclear factor kappa-B p65/STAT3 complexes, which bound to the COP9 signalosome \n5 (CSN5) promoter, leading to its upregulation. Moreover, CSN5 modulated the \ndeubiquitination and stability of PD-L1. High expression of CSN5 in CRC was \nassociated with significantly shorter survival. Furthermore, compound-15 was \nidentified as an inhibitor of CSN5, and destabilized PD-L1 to alleviate the \ntumor burden. Our results suggest that the novel CCL5-p65/STAT3-CSN5-PD-L1 \nsignaling axis is significantly activated by LPS or HCD-driven macrophage \ninfiltration in an animal model of CRC, which likely has therapeutic and \nprognostic implications for human cancers.",

Rat NP cells underwent \nvarious periods of 1.0 MPa compression. To determine whether compression \naffected mitochondrial function, we evaluated the mitochondrial membrane \npotential, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), mitochondrial \nultrastructure and ATP content. Oxidative stress-related indicators reactive \noxygen species, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde were also assessed. To \nverify the relevance between oxidative stress and necroptosis together with \napoptosis, RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1(Nec-1), mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A \n(CsA), antioxidants and small interfering RNA technology were utilized. The \nresults established that compression elicited a time-dependent mitochondrial \ndysfunction and elevated oxidative stress. Nec-1 and CsA restored mitochondrial \nfunction and reduced oxidative stress, which corresponded to decreased \nnecroptosis and apoptosis. CsA down-regulated mitochondrial cyclophilin D \nexpression, but had little effects on RIPK1 expression and pRIPK1 activation. \nAdditionally, we found that Nec-1 largely blocked apoptosis; whereas, the \napoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK increased RIPK1 expression and pRIPK1 activation, \nand coordinated regulation of necroptosis and apoptosis enabled NP cells \nsurvival more efficiently. In contrast to Nec-1, SiRIPK1 exacerbated \nmitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. In summary, RIPK1-mediated \nmitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress play a crucial role in NP cells \nnecroptosis and apoptosis during compression injury. The synergistic regulation \nof necroptosis and apoptosis may exert more beneficial effects on NP cells \nsurvival, and ultimately delaying or even retarding intervertebral disc \ndegeneration.",

The histone demethylase JMJD1A has \nbeen shown to regulate activities of AR and c-Myc transcription factors and \npromote prostate cancer progression. Here, we report that JMJD1A protein \nstability is controlled by the ubiquitin ligase STUB1. High levels of JMJD1A \nwere strongly correlated with low STUB1 levels in human CRPC specimens. STUB1 \ninhibited AR activity, AR-V7 levels, and prostate cancer cell growth partly \nthrough degradation of JMJD1A. Furthermore, the acetyltransferase p300 \nacetylated JMJD1A at lysine (K) 421, a modification that recruits the BET family \nmember BRD4 to block JMJD1A degradation and promote JMJD1A recruitment to AR \ntargets. Increased levels of both total and K421-acetylated JMJD1A were observed \nin prostate cancer cells as they developed resistance to the AR antagonist \nenzalutamide. Treatment of prostate cancer cells with either p300 or BET \ninhibitors destabilized JMJD1A, and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells \nwere more sensitive than parental cells to these inhibitors. Together, our \nfindings identify a critical role for acetylation of JMJD1A in regulating JMJD1A \nstability and AR activity in CRPC. These newly identified mechanisms controlling \nJMJD1A protein stability provide potential druggable targets to encourage the \ndevelopment of additional therapies for advanced prostate cancer.

This study evaluated the effect of \nClotam (tolfenamic acid or TA), a small molecule and inhibitor of Specificity \nprotein1 (Sp1) and survivin for sensitizing ES cell lines to chemotherapeutic \nagent, vincristine (VCR).

The apoptosis markers, caspase 3/7 (activity levels) and \ncleaved-PARP (protein expression) were measured. Cardiomyocytes, H9C2 were used \nas non-malignant cells. While, all treatments caused time- and dose-dependent \ninhibition of cell viability, interestingly, combination treatment caused \nsignificantly higher response (~ 80% inhibition, p < 0.05). Cell viability \ninhibition was accompanied by inhibition of Sp1 and Survivin. TA + VCR treatment \nsignificantly (p < 0.05) increased caspase 3/7 activity which strongly \ncorrelated with upregulated c-PARP level and Annexin V staining. Cell cycle \narrest was observed at G0/G1 (TA) or G2/M (VCR and TA + VCR). All treatments did \nnot cause cytotoxicity in H9C2 cells. These results suggest that TA could \nenhance the anti-cancer activity of VCR in ES cells. Therefore, TA + VCR \ncombination could be further tested to develop as safe/effective therapeutic \nstrategy for treating ES.",

            "TEXT": "TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) activation suppresses autophagy through inhibition \nof FOXO3 and impairs phagocytic capacity of microglia.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is a lysosome-dependent catabolic process for the \nturnover of proteins and organelles in eukaryotes. Autophagy plays an important \nrole in immunity and inflammation, as well as metabolism and cell survival. \nDiverse immune and inflammatory signals induce autophagy in macrophages through \npattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs). However, the \nphysiological role of autophagy and its signaling mechanisms in microglia remain \npoorly understood. Microglia are phagocytic immune cells that are resident in \nthe central nervous system and share many characteristics with macrophages. \nHere, we show that autophagic flux and expression of autophagy-related (Atg) \ngenes in microglia are significantly suppressed upon TLR4 activation by \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS), in contrast to their stimulation by LPS in \nmacrophages. Metabolomics analysis of the levels of phosphatidylinositol \n(PtdIns) and its 3-phosphorylated form, PtdIns3P, in combination with \nbioinformatics prediction, revealed an LPS-induced reduction in the synthesis of \nPtdIns and PtdIns3P in microglia but not macrophages. Interestingly, inhibition \nof PI3K, but not MTOR or MAPK1/3, restored autophagic flux with concomitant \ndephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FOXO3. A constitutively active \nform of FOXO3 also induced autophagy, suggesting FOXO3 as a downstream target of \nthe PI3K pathway for autophagy inhibition. LPS treatment impaired phagocytic \ncapacity of microglia, including MAP1LC3B/LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and \namyloid β (Aβ) clearance. PI3K inhibition restored LAP and degradation capacity \nof microglia against Aβ. These findings suggest a unique mechanism for the \nregulation of microglial autophagy and point to the PI3K-FOXO3 pathway as a \npotential therapeutic target to regulate microglial function in brain disorders.",

The aim of the present study is to determine the role of \nmitochondrial fission proteins and/or other proteins that localise on cardiac \nmitochondria for apoptosis upon ethanol consumption. In vivo and in vitro \nchronic alcohol exposure increased mitochondrial Drp1 levels but knockdown of \nthe same did not confer cardioprotection in H9c2 cells. These cells displayed \ndownregulated expression of MFN2 and OPA1 for Bak-mediated cytochrome c release \nand apoptosis. Dysregulated PTEN/AKT cell survival signal in both ethanol \ntreated and Drp1 knockdown cells augmented oxidative stress by promoting  \nmitochondrial PTEN-L and MFN1 interaction. Inhibiting this interaction with \nVO-OHpic, a reversible PTEN inhibitor, prevented Bak insertion into the \nmitochondria and release of cytochrome c to cytoplasm. Thus, our study provides \nevidence that Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission is dispensable for \nethanol-induced cardiotoxicity and that stress signals induce mitochondrial \nPTEN-L accumulation for structural and functional dyshomeostasis. Our in vivo \nresults also demonstrates the therapeutic potential of VO-OHpic for habitual \nalcoholics developing myocardial dysfunction.",

Smac mimetic \ncompounds (also known as antagonists of IAPs) mimic the function of Smac/Diablo \nand sensitize cancer cells to TNF-induced apoptosis.

Therefore, it is important to find strategies of combined chemotherapy \nto increase chemosensitivity and reduce the adverse effects. Here, we report \nthat doxorubicin synergizes with Smac mimetic to trigger TNF-mediated apoptosis, \nwhich is mechanistically distinct from doxorubicin-induced cell death. \nDoxorubicin sensitizes cancer cells including human pancreatic and colorectal \ncancer cells to Smac mimetic treatment. The combined treatment leads to \nsynergistic induction of TNFα to initiate apoptosis through activating NF-κB and \nc-Jun signaling pathways. Knockdown of caspase-8 or knockout of FADD \nsignificantly blocked apoptosis synergistically induced by Smac mimetic and \ndoxorubicin, but had no effect on cell death caused by doxorubicin alone. \nMoreover, Smac mimetic and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis requires \nreceptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and its deubiquitinating enzyme \ncylindromatosis (CYLD), not A20. These in vitro findings demonstrate that \ncombination of Smac mimetic and doxorubicin synergistically triggers apoptosis \nthrough the TNF/CYLD/RIPK1/FADD/caspase-8 signaling pathway. Importantly, the \ncombined treatment induced in vivo synergistic anti-tumor effects in the \nxenograft tumor model.

Caspases 1, \n4, 5 and 11 trigger this regulated form of necrosis by cleaving the pyroptosis \neffector gasdermin D (GSDMD), causing its pore-forming amino-terminal domain to \noligomerize and perforate the plasma membrane.

In this study, we triggered \nprimary macrophages to undergo pyroptosis from three inflammasome types and \nrecorded their dynamics and morphology using high-resolution live-cell spinning \ndisk confocal laser microscopy. Based on quantitative analysis of single-cell \nsubcellular events, we propose a model of pyroptotic cell disintegration that is \ninitiated by opening of GSDMD-dependent ion channels or pores that are more \nrestrictive than recently proposed GSDMD pores, followed by osmotic cell \nswelling, commitment of mitochondria and other membrane-bound organelles prior \nto sudden rupture of the plasma membrane and full permeability to intracellular \nproteins. This study provides a dynamic framework for understanding cellular \nchanges that occur during pyroptosis, and charts a chronological sequence of \nGSDMD-mediated subcellular events that define pyroptotic cell death at the \nsingle-cell level.",

However, the mechanism by which the initial injury of tubular \nepithelial cells (TECs) drives interstitial inflammation remains unclear. This \npaper aims to explore the role of exosomal miRNAs derived from TECs in the \ndevelopment of tubulointerstitial inflammation. Global microRNA(miRNA) \nexpression profiling of renal exosomes was examined in a LPS induced acute \nkidney injury (AKI) mouse model and miR-19b-3p was identified as the miRNA that \nwas most notably increased in TEC-derived exosomes compared to controls. Similar \nresults were also found in an adriamycin (ADR) induced chronic proteinuric \nkidney disease model in which exosomal miR-19b-3p was markedly released. \nInterestingly, once released, TEC-derived exosomal miR-19b-3p was internalized \nby macrophages, leading to M1 phenotype polarization through targeting \nNF-κB/SOCS-1. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that SOCS-1 was the \ndirect target of miR-19b-3p. Importantly, the pathogenic role of exosomal \nmiR-19b-3p in initiating renal inflammation was revealed by the ability of \nadoptively transferred of purified TEC-derived exosomes to cause \ntubulointerstitial inflammation in mice, which was reversed by inhibition of \nmiR-19b-3p. Clinically, high levels of miR-19b-3p were found in urinary exosomes \nand were correlated with the severity of tubulointerstitial inflammation in \npatients with diabetic nephropathy. Thus, our studies demonstrated that exosomal \nmiR-19b-3p mediated the communication between injured TECs and macrophages, \nleading to M1 macrophage activation. The exosome/miR-19b-3p/SOCS1 axis played a \ncritical pathologic role in tubulointerstitial inflammation, representing a new \ntherapeutic target for kidney disease.",

Therefore, understanding the \nmechanisms that regulate the balance between mitotic cell death and mitotic \nslippage is an important task. Here we report that FBXW7 protein levels markedly \ndecline during extended mitotic arrest. FBXO45 binds to a conserved acidic \nN-terminal motif of FBXW7 specifically under a prolonged delay in mitosis, \nleading to ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of FBXW7 by the \nFBXO45-MYCBP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase.

Here, we show that type I interferon (IFN) production \ntriggered by dsDNA or human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is controlled by the cellular \nm6A methyltrasferase subunit METTL14 and ALKBH5 demethylase. While METTL14 \ndepletion reduced virus reproduction and stimulated dsDNA- or HCMV-induced IFNB1 \nmRNA accumulation, ALKBH5 depletion had the opposite effect.

Genome-wide transcriptome profiling \nfollowing ALKBH5 depletion identified differentially expressed genes regulating \nantiviral immune responses, while METTL14 depletion altered pathways impacting \nmetabolic reprogramming, stress responses, and aging. Finally, we determined \nthat IFNB1 mRNA was m6A-modified within both the coding sequence and the 3' \nuntranslated region (UTR). This establishes that the host m6A modification \nmachinery controls IFNβ production triggered by HCMV or dsDNA.

In our study, we found that the expression and activation \nlevels of NLRP3 inflammasome components, including NLRP3, an \napoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) containing caspase activation and \nrecruitment domain (CARD) and caspase-1 (CAS1), were significantly upregulated. \nIn addition, we found interleukin (IL)-1β activity increased while IL-18 \nactivity decreased in the retinas of oxygen-induced ischemic retinopathy (OIR) \nmice. MCC950, an inhibitor of NLRP3, reversed the IL-1β/IL-18 activation \npattern, inhibited the formation of retinal neovascularization (RNV), decreased \nthe number of acellular capillaries and reduced leakage of retinal vessels. \nMoreover, MCC950 could regulate the expression of endothelial cell- and pericyte \nfunction-associated molecules, such as vascular endothelial growth factor \n(VEGF), VEGF receptor (VEGFR)1, VEGFR2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, \ntissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)1, TIMP2, platelet-derived growth \nfactor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B), and \nangiopoietin2 (Ang2). In vitro, recombinant human (r)IL-18 and rIL-1β regulated \nthe expression of endothelial cell- and pericyte function-associated molecules \nand the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and pericytes. We \ntherefore determined that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 can \nregulate the function of endothelial cells and pericytes by reversing the \nIL-1β/IL-18 activation pattern to ameliorate RNV and leakage; thereby opening \nnew avenues to treat RNV-associated ocular diseases.",

We report \nhere that Hippo signaling cell-autonomously regulates CF fate transitions and \nproliferation, and non-cell-autonomously regulates both myeloid and CF \nactivation in the heart. Conditional deletion of Hippo pathway kinases, Lats1 \nand Lats2, in uninjured CFs initiated a self-perpetuating fibrotic response in \nthe adult heart that was exacerbated by myocardial infarction (MI). Single cell \ntranscriptomics showed that uninjured Lats1/2 mutant CFs spontaneously \ntransitioned to a myofibroblast cell state. Through gene regulatory network \nreconstruction, we found that Hippo-deficient myofibroblasts deployed a network \nof transcriptional regulators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and the \nunfolded protein response (UPR) consistent with elevated secretory activity. We \nobserved an expansion of myeloid cell heterogeneity in uninjured Lats1/2 CKO \nhearts with similarity to cells recovered from control hearts post-MI. \nIntegrated genome-wide analysis of Yap chromatin occupancy revealed that Yap \ndirectly activates myofibroblast cell identity genes, the proto-oncogene Myc, \nand an array of genes encoding pro-inflammatory factors through \nenhancer-promoter looping. Our data indicate that Lats1/2 maintain the resting \nCF cell state through restricting the Yap-induced injury response.",

Autophagy partially reduced ER stress and restored UPR signaling \nby autophagic clearance of ubiquitin-protein aggregates, thereby reducing \napoptosis. In addition, the ER stress antagonist 4-phenylbutyric acid \nupregulated autophagy in HUVECs.

In the present \nstudy, the role of MLKL in chelerythrine (CHE)-promoted apoptosis was studied. A \nspecial band of MLKL (i.e., *MLKL) was observed after treatment with CHE.

A decreased ROS level inhibited \nCHE-mediated nuclear translocation of MLKL and *MLKL and the activation of \neIF2α, whereas MLKL or eIF2α silencing did not affect the CHE-triggered ROS \ngeneration. Furthermore, MLKL silencing prevented the CHE-activated eIF2α \nsignal, and eIF2α silencing blocked the CHE-induced nuclear translocation of \nMLKL and *MLKL. Our studies suggested that CHE possibly induces apoptosis \nthrough the nuclear translocation of MLKL and *MLKL, which is promoted by a \nmutual regulation between MLKL and PERK-eIF2α pathway in response to ROS \nformation. The present study clarified the new function of MLKL in apoptosis.",

We previously showed that in colon tumors, a subpopulation of LGR5+ \nCSC-like cells driven by TCF1 (TCF7), a Wnt-responsive transcription factor, \nwere responsible for tumorigenicity. Here we demonstrate that the tumorigenic \nsubpopulation of mouse LGR5+ cells exists in a slow-cycling state and identify a \nunique 22-gene signature that characterizes these slow-cycling CSC. Seven of the \nsignature genes are specifically expressed in slow-cycling LGR5+ cells from \nxenografted human colon tumors and are upregulated in colon cancer clinical \nspecimens. Among these seven, four genes (APCDD1, NOTUM, PROX1, and SP5) are \nknown to be direct Wnt target genes, and PROX1 was expressed in the invasive \nfronts of colon tumors. PROX1 was activated by TCF1 to induce CDKN1C and \nmaintain a slow-cycling state in colon cancer organoids. Strikingly, PROX1 was \nrequired for recurrent growth after chemotherapeutic treatment, suggesting that \ninhibition of slow-cycling CSC by targeting the TCF1-PROX1-CDKN1C pathway is an \neffective strategy to combat refractory colon cancer in combination with \nconventional chemotherapy.",

Here, we report an \nunexpected role for SHP in the exocrine pancreas as a modulator of the \nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. SHP expression is induced in acinar \ncells in response to ER stress and regulates the protein stability of the \nspliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1s), a key mediator of ER stress \nresponse. Loss of SHP reduces XBP1s protein level and transcriptional activity, \nwhich in turn attenuates the ER stress response during the fasting-feeding \ncycle. Consequently, SHP-deficient mice also are more susceptible to \ncerulein-induced pancreatitis. Mechanistically, we show that SHP physically \ninteracts with the transactivation domain of XBP1s, thereby inhibiting the \npolyubiquitination and degradation of XBP1s by the Cullin3-SPOP (speckle-type \nPOZ protein) E3 ligase complex. Together, our data implicate SHP in governing ER \nhomeostasis and identify a novel posttranslational regulatory mechanism for the \nkey ER stress response effector XBP1.",

            "TEXT": "PERK controls bone homeostasis through the regulation of osteoclast \ndifferentiation and function.\n\nOsteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells with the ability to degrade bone \ntissue, and are closely related to abnormal bone metabolic diseases. Endoplasmic \nreticulum (ER) is an organelle responsible for protein modification, quality \ncontrol, and transportation. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins \nin ER cavity induces ER stress. Double-stranded RNA-dependent protein \nkinase-like ER kinase (PERK) is an ER stress-sensing protein, which is \nubiquitous in eukaryotic cells. Systemic PERK knockout mice show severe bone \nloss, suggesting that PERK is of great significance for maintaining the normal \ngrowth and development of bone tissue, but the role of PERK in \nosteoclastogenesis is still unclear. In this study, we found that PERK was \nsignificantly activated during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation; \nknockdown of PERK by siRNA and inhibition of PERK by GSK2606414, respectively, \nhad significant negative regulatory effects on the formation and bone resorption \nof osteoclasts. PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 down-regulated the mRNA levels and \nprotein expression of osteoclast differentiation marker genes, and inhibited \nRANKL-induced activation of Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear \nfactor κB (NF-κB) pathways. Treatment with PERK inhibitor GSK2606414 in \novariectomized mouse model significantly suppressed bone loss and osteoclast \nformation. Thapsigargin activated ER stress to enhance autophagy, while \nGSK2606414 had a significant inhibitory effect on autophagy flux and \nautophagosome formation. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibit the \nexpression of PERK phosphorylation, osteoclast-related proteins and \nautophagy-related proteins, but the use of PERK activator CCT020312 can reverse \ninhibition effect of NAC. Our findings demonstrate a key role for PERK in \nosteoclast differentiation and suggest its therapeutic potential.",

SIAH proteins promote the ubiquitination and \nproteasomal degradation of Axin through interacting with a VxP motif in the \nGSK3-binding domain of Axin, and this function of SIAH is counteracted by GSK3 \nbinding to Axin. Structural analysis reveals that the Axin segment responsible \nfor SIAH binding is also involved in GSK3 binding but adopts distinct \nconformations in Axin/SIAH and Axin/GSK3 complexes. Knockout of SIAH1 blocks \nWnt-induced Axin ubiquitination and attenuates Wnt-induced β-catenin \nstabilization. Our data suggest that Wnt-induced dissociation of the Axin/GSK3 \ncomplex allows SIAH to interact with Axin not associated with GSK3 and promote \nits degradation and that SIAH-mediated Axin degradation represents an important \nfeed-forward mechanism to achieve sustained Wnt/β-catenin signaling.",

            "TEXT": "High-fat diet promotes renal injury by inducing oxidative stress and \nmitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nObesity has been recognized as a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease, \nbut the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated the \nmechanism whereby long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces renal injury in \nmice. The C57BL/6 mice fed HFD for 16 weeks developed obesity, diabetes, and \nkidney dysfunction manifested by albuminuria and blood accumulation of BUN and \ncreatinine. The HFD-fed kidney showed marked glomerular and tubular injuries, \nincluding prominent defects in the glomerular filtration barrier and increased \ntubular cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, HFD feeding markedly increased \ntriglyceride and cholesterol contents in the kidney and activated lipogenic \npathways for cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis. HFD feeding also increased \noxidative stress and induced mitochondrial fission in tubular cells, thereby \nactivating the pro-apoptotic pathway. In HK-2 and mesangial cell cultures, high \nglucose, fatty acid, and TNF-α combination was able to activate the lipogenic \npathways, increase oxidative stress, promote mitochondrial fission, and activate \nthe pro-apoptotic pathway, all of which could be attenuated by an inhibitor that \ndepleted reactive oxygen species. Taken together, these observations suggest \nthat long-term HFD feeding causes kidney injury at least in part as a result of \ntissue lipid accumulation, increased oxidative stress, and mitochondrial \ndysfunction, which promote excess programmed cell death.",

Therefore, reducing accumulated iron and associated \noxidative stress is considered a promising therapeutic strategy for PD. However, \ncurrent iron chelators have poor membrane permeability and lack cell-type \nspecificity. Here we identified GSK-J4, a histone demethylase inhibitor with the \nability to cross blood brain barrier, as a potent iron suppressor. Only a trace \namount of GSK-J4 significantly and selectively reduced intracellular labile iron \nin dopaminergic neurons, and suppressed H2O2 and 6-OHDA-induced cell death in \nvitro. The iron-suppressive effect was mainly mediated by inducing an increase \nin the expression of the iron exporter ferroportin-1. In parallel, GSK-J4 \nrescued dopaminergic neuron loss and motor defects in 6-OHDA-induced PD rats, \nwhich was accompanied by reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly, GSK-J4 \nrescued the abnormal changes of histone methylation, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 during \n6-OHDA treatment although the iron-suppressive and neuroprotective effects were \nsensitive to H3K4me3 inhibition only. Also, upregulating H3K4me3 increased \nferroportin-1 expression and neuroprotection. Taken together, we demonstrate a \npreviously unappreciated action of GSK-J4 on cell-specific iron suppression and \nneuroprotection via epigenetic mechanism. Compared with conventional iron \nchelators, this compound has a stronger therapeutic potential for PD.",

It induces apoptotic cell death \nin various cell types, but very little is known about the mechanism involved in \nthe process. Here, we used budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model to \nstudy the involvement of some key elements of apoptosis in the anacardic \nacid-induced cell death. Plasma membrane constriction, chromatin condensation, \nDNA degradation, and externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) indicated that \nanacardic acid induces apoptotic cell death in S. cerevisiae. However, the \nexogenous addition of broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or deletion of \nthe yeast caspase Yca1 showed that the anacardic acid-induced cell death is \ncaspase independent. Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF1) deletion mutant was \nresistant to the anacardic acid-induced cell death, suggesting a key role of \nAif1. Overexpression of Aif1 made cells highly susceptible to anacardic acid, \nfurther confirming that Aif1 mediates anacardic acid-induced apoptosis. \nInterestingly, instead of the increase in the intracellular reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) normally observed during apoptosis, anacardic acid caused a \ndecrease in the intracellular ROS levels. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis \nshowed downregulation of the BIR1 survivin mRNA expression during the anacardic \nacid-induced apoptosis.",

            "TEXT": "CDK12 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 to enable mTORC1-dependent translation and mitotic \ngenome stability.\n\nThe RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain kinase, CDK12, regulates genome \nstability, expression of DNA repair genes, and cancer cell resistance to \nchemotherapy and immunotherapy. In addition to its role in mRNA biosynthesis of \nDNA repair genes, we show here that CDK12 phosphorylates the mRNA 5' cap-binding \nrepressor, 4E-BP1, to promote translation of mTORC1-dependent mRNAs. In \nparticular, we found that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTORC1 (T37 and T46) \nfacilitates subsequent CDK12 phosphorylation at two Ser-Pro sites (S65 and T70) \nthat control the exchange of 4E-BP1 with eIF4G at the 5' cap of CHK1 and other \ntarget mRNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (RIP-seq) \nrevealed that CDK12 regulates release of 4E-BP1, and binding of eIF4G, to many \nmTORC1 target mRNAs, including those needed for MYC transformation. Genome-wide \nribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) further identified specific CDK12 \n\"translation-only\" target mRNAs, including many mTORC1 target mRNAs as well as \nmany subunits of mitotic and centromere/centrosome complexes. Accordingly, \nconfocal imaging analyses revealed severe chromosome misalignment, bridging, and \nsegregation defects in cells deprived of CDK12 or CCNK. We conclude that the \nnuclear RNAPII-CTD kinase CDK12 cooperates with mTORC1, and controls a \nspecialized translation network that is essential for mitotic chromosome \nstability.",

To distinguish the genomic \nlandscape of ASCP and identify actionable targets for this lethal cancer, we \napplied DNA content flow cytometry to a series of 15 tumor samples including \nfive patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We interrogated purified sorted tumor \nfractions from these samples with whole-genome copy-number variant (CNV), \nwhole-exome sequencing, and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using \nsequencing (ATAC-seq) analyses. These identified a variety of somatic genomic \nlesions targeting chromatin regulators in ASCP genomes that were superimposed on \nwell-characterized genomic lesions including mutations in TP53 (87%) and KRAS \n(73%), amplification of MYC (47%), and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (40%) that \nare common in PDACs. Furthermore, a comparison of ATAC-seq profiles of three \nASCP and three PDAC genomes using flow-sorted PDX models identified genes with \naccessible chromatin unique to the ASCP genomes, including the lysine \nmethyltransferase SMYD2 and the pancreatic cancer stem cell regulator RORC in \nall three ASCPs, and a FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion associated with focal CNVs in both \ngenes in a single ASCP. Finally, we demonstrate significant activity of a pan \nFGFR inhibitor against organoids derived from the FGFR1-ERLIN2 fusion-positive \nASCP PDX model. Our results suggest that the genomic and epigenomic landscape of \nASCP provide new strategies for targeting this aggressive subtype of pancreatic \ncancer.",

Previously we have shown that a group \nof corazonin-producing peptidergic neurons (vCrz) undergo apoptosis in response \nto ecdysone signaling via ecdysone receptor (EcR)-B isoforms and Ultraspiracle \nduring early phase of metamorphosis. Further utilizing genetic, transgenic, and \nmosaic analyses, we have found that TGF-β signaling mediated by a glia-produced \nligand, Myoglianin, type-I receptor Baboon (particularly Babo-A isoform) and \ndSmad2, is also required autonomously for PCD of the vCrz neurons. Our studies \nshow that TGF-β signaling is not acting epistatically to EcR or vice versa. We \nalso show that ectopic expression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic form \nof dSmad2 (dSmad2PM) is capable of inducing premature death of vCrz neurons in \nlarva but not other larval neurons. Intriguingly, the dSmad2PM-mediated killing \nis completely suppressed by coexpression of a dominant-negative form of EcR \n(EcRDN), suggesting that EcR function is required for the proapoptotic dSmad2PM \nfunction. Based on these data, we suggest that TGF-β and ecdysone signaling \npathways act cooperatively to induce vCrz neuronal PCD. We propose that this \ntype of two-factor authentication is a key developmental strategy to ensure the \ntimely PCD of specific larval neurons during metamorphosis.",

Although components of \nthis pathway have been previously generated and studied in vitro, the assembly \nof this multi-synaptic circuit has not yet been achieved with human cells. Here, \nwe derive organoids resembling the cerebral cortex or the hindbrain/spinal cord \nand assemble them with human skeletal muscle spheroids to generate 3D \ncortico-motor assembloids. Using rabies tracing, calcium imaging, and \npatch-clamp recordings, we show that corticofugal neurons project and connect \nwith spinal spheroids, while spinal-derived motor neurons connect with muscle. \nGlutamate uncaging or optogenetic stimulation of cortical spheroids triggers \nrobust contraction of 3D muscle, and assembloids are morphologically and \nfunctionally intact for up to 10 weeks post-fusion. Together, this system \nhighlights the remarkable self-assembly capacity of 3D cultures to form \nfunctional circuits that could be used to understand development and disease.",

            "TEXT": "SDF-1 induces TNF-mediated apoptosis in cardiac myocytes.\n\nChemokines are small secreted proteins with chemoattractant properties that play \na key role in inflammation. One such chemokine, Stromal cell-derived factor-1 \n(SDF-1) also known as CXCL12, and its receptor, CXCR4, are expressed and \nfunctional in cardiac myocytes. SDF-1 both stimulates and enhances the cellular \nsignal which attracts potentially beneficial stem cells for tissue repair within \nthe ischemic heart. Paradoxically however, this chemokine is known to act in \nconcert with the inflammatory cytokines of the innate immune response which \ncontributes to cellular injury through the recruitment of inflammatory cells \nduring ischemia. In the present study, we have demonstrated that SDF-1 has dose \ndependent effects on freshly isolated cardiomyocytes. Using Tunnel and caspase \n3-activation assays, we have demonstrated that the treatment of isolated adult \nrat cardiac myocyte with SDF-1 at higher concentrations (pathological \nconcentrations) induced apoptosis. Furthermore, ELISA data demonstrated that the \ntreatment of isolated adult rat cardiac myocyte with SDF-1 at higher \nconcentrations upregulated TNF-α protein expression which directly correlated \nwith subsequent apoptosis. There was a significant reduction in SDF-1 mediated \napoptosis when TNF-α expression was neutralized which suggests that SDF-1 \nmediated apoptosis is TNF-α-dependent. The fact that certain stimuli are capable \nof driving cardiomyocytes into apoptosis indicates that these cells are \nsusceptible to clinically relevant apoptotic triggers. Our findings suggest that \nthe elevated SDF-1 levels seen in a variety of clinical conditions, including \nischemic myocardial infarction, may either directly or indirectly contribute to \ncardiac cell death via a TNF-α mediated pathway. This highlights the importance \nof this receptor/ligand in regulating the cardiomyocyte response to stress \nconditions.",

            "TEXT": "Molecular subtype-specific responses of colon cancer cells to the SMAC mimetic \nBirinapant.\n\nColorectal cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. Responses to genotoxic \nchemotherapy in the adjuvant or palliative setting vary greatly between \npatients, and colorectal cancer cells often resist chemotherapy by evading \napoptosis. Antagonists of an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can restore \ndefective apoptosis signaling by degrading cIAP1 and cIAP2 proteins and by \ninhibition of XIAP. Due to the multiple molecular mechanisms-of-action of these \ntargets, responses to IAP antagonist may differ between molecularly distinct \ncolon cancer cells. In this study, responses to the IAP antagonist Birinapant \nand oxaliplatin/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated in 14 colon cancer cell \nlines, representing the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). Treatment with \nBirinapant alone did not result in a substantial increase in apoptotic cells in \nthis cell line panel. Annexin-V/PI assays quantified by flow cytometry and \nhigh-content screening showed that Birinapant increased responses of CMS1 and \npartially CMS3 cell lines to oxaliplatin/5-FU, whereas CMS2 cells were not \neffectively sensitized. FRET-based imaging of caspase-8 and -3 activation \nvalidated these differences at the single-cell level, with CMS1 cells displaying \nsustained activation of caspase-8-like activity during Birinapant and \noxaliplatin/5-FU co-treatment, ultimately activating the intrinsic mitochondrial \napoptosis pathway. In CMS2 cell lines, Birinapant exhibited synergistic effects \nin combination with TNFα, suggesting that Birinapant can restore extrinsic \napoptosis signaling in the context of inflammatory signals in this subtype. To \nexplore this further, we co-cultured CMS2 and CMS1 colon cancer cells with \nperipheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed increased cell death during \nBirinapant single treatment in these co-cultures, which was abrogated by \nanti-TNFα-neutralizing antibodies. Collectively, our study demonstrates that IAP \ninhibition is a promising modulator of response to oxaliplatin/5-FU in \ncolorectal cancers of the CMS1 subtype, and may show promise as in the CMS2 \nsubtype, suggesting that molecular subtyping may aid as a patient stratification \ntool for IAP antagonists in this disease.",

To identify potential interactions \nbetween SMARCB1 loss and the process of neural development, we introduced an \ninducible SMARCB1 loss-of-function system into human induced pluripotent stem \ncells (iPSCs) that were subjected to either directed neuronal differentiation or \ndifferentiation into cerebral organoids. Using this system, we identified \nsubstantial differences in the downstream effects of SMARCB1 loss depending on \ndifferentiation state and identified an interaction between SMARCB1 loss and \nneural differentiation pressure that causes a resistance to terminal \ndifferentiation and a defect in maintenance of a normal cell state. Our results \nprovide insight into how SMARCB1 loss might interact with neural development in \nthe process of ATRT tumorigenesis.",

Here we \nprovide evidence that alterations in chromatin modifying enzymes, including \nKDM6A and members of the SWI/SNF complex, are frequent in muscle-invasive \nbladder cancer. We exploit the loss of function mutations in KDM6A and SWI/SNF \ncomplex to make bladder cancer cells susceptible to EZH2-based epigenetic \ntherapy that activates an immune response to drive tumor cell differentiation \nand death. We reveal a novel mechanism of action of EZH2 inhibition, alone and \nin combination with cisplatin, which induces immune signaling with the largest \nchanges observed in interferon gamma (IFN-γ). This upregulation is a result of \nactivated natural killer (NK) signaling as demonstrated by the increase in NK \ncell-associated genes MIP-1α, ICAM1, ICAM2, and CD86 in xenografts treated with \nEZH2 inhibitors. Conversely, EZH2 inhibition results in decreased expression of \npluripotency markers, ALDH2 and CK5, and increased cell death. Our results \nreveal a novel sensitivity of muscle-invasive bladder cancer cells with KMD6A \nand SWI/SNF mutations to EZH2 inhibition alone and in combination with \ncisplatin. This sensitivity is mediated through increased NK cell-related \nsignaling resulting in tumor cell differentiation and cell death.",

Treatment failure is due to the cancer stem cells \n(CSC) phenotype maintenance and self-renewal. BET degraders such as ZBC260 \nrepresents a novel class of BET inhibitors that act by inducing BET proteins \ndegradation. This study explores the mode of action and effects of ZBC260 in \nvivo and in vitro against glioma. By inhibiting cell proliferation and inducting \ncell cycle arrest, the fact that glioma cell lines show sensitivity to ZBC260. \nNotably, ZBC260 targeted glioma without side effects in vivo. In addition, the \nstem cell-like properties of glioma cells were inhibited upon ZBC260 treatment. \nWhen the mechanism was examined, our findings indicated that Wnt/β-catenin \npathway repression is required for ZBC260-induced stem cell-like properties and \ntumor growth suppression. In conclusion, the growth of tumors and stem cell-like \nproperties were inhibited by ZBC260 via Wnt/β-catenin repression, which suggests \nZBC260 as a potential therapeutic agent for glioma.",

Functional assays, including EdU, wound healing, transwell, and \nimmunofluorescence staining, revealed the effect of PCAT6 on cell proliferation, \nmigration, and EMT process. The tube-formation assay disclosed the function of \nPCAT6 on angiogenesis. In vivo assays were also established to explore the \nimpact of PCAT6 on tumor growth and microangiogenesis. The results revealed that \nPCAT6 boosted TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis both in vitro \nand in vivo. Then, this study unveiled that M2 macrophage secreted VEGF to \nstimulate the upregulation of PCAT6, thus promoting angiogenesis in TNBC. Next, \nthrough bioinformatics analysis and mechanism assays, we identified that PCAT6 \npositively regulated VEGFR2 expression via ceRNA pattern and then participated \nin VEGFR/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to accelerate angiogenesis. Moreover, PCAT6 \nbound USP14, a deubiquitinase, to induce the deubiquitination of VEGFR2. On the \nwhole, M2 macrophage-induced upregulation of PCAT6 facilitates TNBC \ntumorigenesis through modulation of VEGFR2 expression via ceRNA and \ndeubiquitination patterns.",

            "TEXT": "Identification of transcription factors that regulate ATG8 expression and \nautophagy in Arabidopsis.\n\nAutophagy is a conserved catabolic process in eukaryotes that contributes to \ncell survival in response to multiple stresses and is important for organism \nfitness. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the core machinery of autophagy is well \ndefined, but its transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. The ATG8 \n(autophagy-related 8) protein plays central roles in decorating autophagosomes \nand binding to specific cargo receptors to recruit cargo to autophagosomes. We \npropose that the transcriptional control of ATG8 genes is important during the \nformation of autophagosomes and therefore contributes to survival during stress. \nHere, we describe a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen for transcription factors \n(TFs) that regulate ATG8 gene expression in Arabidopsis, using the promoters of \n4 ATG8 genes. We identified a total of 225 TFs from 35 families that bind these \npromoters. The TF-ATG8 promoter interactions revealed a wide array of diverse TF \nfamilies for different promoters, as well as enrichment for families of TFs that \nbound to specific fragments. These TFs are not only involved in plant \ndevelopmental processes but also in the response to environmental stresses. TGA9 \n(TGACG (TGA) motif-binding protein 9)/AT1G08320 was confirmed as a positive \nregulator of autophagy. TGA9 overexpression activated autophagy under both \ncontrol and stress conditions and transcriptionally up-regulated expression of \nATG8B, ATG8E and additional ATG genes via binding to their promoters. Our \nresults provide a comprehensive resource of TFs that regulate ATG8 gene \nexpression and lay a foundation for understanding the transcriptional regulation \nof plant autophagy.",

The evolutionary \norigins of this two-recombinase system remain poorly understood. Interestingly, \nDmc1 can stabilize mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Rad51 cannot. \nHere, we demonstrate that this difference can be attributed to three amino acids \nconserved only within the Dmc1 lineage of the Rad51/RecA family. Chimeric Rad51 \nmutants harboring Dmc1-specific amino acids gain the ability to stabilize \nheteroduplex DNA joints with mismatch-containing base triplets, whereas Dmc1 \nmutants with Rad51-specific amino acids lose this ability. Remarkably, RAD-51 \nfrom Caenorhabditis elegans, an organism without Dmc1, has acquired \"Dmc1-like\" \namino acids. Chimeric C. elegans RAD-51 harboring \"canonical\" Rad51 amino acids \ngives rise to toxic recombination intermediates, which must be actively \ndismantled to permit normal meiotic progression. We propose that Dmc1 \nlineage-specific amino acids involved in the stabilization of heteroduplex DNA \njoints with mismatch-containing base triplets may contribute to normal meiotic \nrecombination.",

But tools affecting nonmyocyte apoptosis are very rare. \nSphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a naturally occurring bioactive sphingolipid \nin plasma, was proved to protect cardiomyocyte against apoptosis in an ischemic \nmodel in our previous study. Here, we showed that SPC also inhibited \nhypoxia-induced apoptosis in myofibroblasts, an important type of nonmyocytes in \nthe heart. Calmodulin (CaM) is an identified receptor of SPC. We clarified that \nSPC inhibited myofibroblast apoptosis through CaM as evidenced by decreased \ncleaved caspase 3, PARP1 and condensed nucleus. Furthermore, the employment of \ninhibitor and agonist of p38 and STAT3 suggests that SPC inhibits myofibroblast \napoptosis by regulating the phosphorylation of p38 and STAT3, and they act as \ndownstream of CaM. The present work may provide new evidence on the regulation \nof myofibroblasts apoptosis by SPC and a novel target for heart remodeling after \nhypoxia.",

The clearance of dead cells or efferocytosis is \na critical cellular program of inflammation-resolution. Impaired efferocytosis \ncan lead to tissue damage in prevalent human diseases, like atherosclerosis. \nTherefore understanding mechanisms associated with swift clearance of dead cells \nis of utmost clinical importance. Recently, the accumulation of necroptotic \ncells (NCs) was observed in human plaques and we postulated that this is due to \ndefective clearance programs. Here we present evidence that NCs are \ninefficiently taken up by macrophages because they have increased surface \nexpression of a well-known \"don't eat me\" signal called CD47. High levels of \nCD47 on NCs stimulated RhoA-pMLC signaling in macrophages that promoted \n\"nibbling\", rather than whole-cell engulfment of NCs. Anti-CD47 blocking \nantibodies limited RhoA-p-MLC signaling and promoted whole-cell NC engulfment. \nTreatment with anti-CD47 blocking antibodies to Ldlr-/- mice with established \natherosclerosis decreased necrotic cores, limited the accumulation of plaque NCs \nand increased lesional SPMs, including Resolvin D1 (RvD1) compared with IgG \ncontrols. Mechanistically, RvD1 promoted whole-cell engulfment of NCs by \ndecreasing RhoA signaling and activating CDC42. RvD1 specifically targeted NCs \nfor engulfment by facilitating the release of the well-known \"eat me signal\" \ncalled calreticulin from macrophages in a CDC42 dependent manner. Lastly, RvD1 \nenhanced the clearance of NCs in advanced murine plaques. Together, these \nresults suggest new molecules and signaling associated with the clearance of \nNCs, provide a new paradigm for the regulation of inflammation-resolution, and \noffer a potential treatment strategy for diseases where NCs underpin the \npathology.",

Abundant evidence has shown that circRNAs \nare involved in the progression of various cancers. However, the particular \nfunctions of circRNAs in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain elusive. In this study, \nwe investigated the differentially expressed circRNAs in three pairs of cancer \ntissue and adjacent normal tissue of CRC. We revealed that circGLIS2 expression \nwas higher in CRC tissue and cell lines. Gain-and-loss function assays showed \nthat circGLIS2 was involved in the regulation of cell migration. Moreover, \noverexpressing circGLIS2 in CRC cells activated the NF-κB pathway and induced \npro-inflammatory chemokine production, which evoked tumor-associated \ninflammation through recruiting leukocytes. In turn, when the cancer cells were \nexposed to the supernatant of circGLIS2 overexpressed cancer cells, they were \nendowed with the ability of migration and chemokines production. Furthermore, \nthe rescue assay confirmed that circGLIS2 activated NF-κB signaling and promoted \ncell migration by sponging miR-671. Overall, our study reveals that circGLIS2, \nacting as a potential oncogene, maintains the abnormal activation state of the \nNF-κB signaling pathway via the miR-671 sponge mechanism in CRC cells.

Here we demonstrate \nan important role of macroautophagy/autophagy (especially mitophagy) in the \nprotective effect of IPC in kidneys. IPC induced autophagy in renal tubular \ncells in mice and suppressed subsequent renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). \nThe protective effect of IPC was abolished by pharmacological inhibitors of \nautophagy and by the ablation of Atg7 from kidney proximal tubules. Pretreatment \nwith BECN1/Beclin1 peptide induced autophagy and protected against IRI. These \nresults suggest the dependence of IPC protection on renal autophagy. During IPC, \nthe mitophagy regulator PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) was activated. \nBoth IPC and BECN1 peptide enhanced mitolysosome formation during renal IRI in \nmitophagy reporter mice, suggesting that IPC may protect kidneys by activating \nmitophagy. We further established an in vitro model of IPC by inducing 'chemical \nischemia' in kidney proximal tubular cells with carbonyl cyanide \n3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). Brief treatment with CCCP protected against \nsubsequent injury in these cells and the protective effect was abrogated by \nautophagy inhibition. In vitro IPC increased mitophagosome formation, enhanced \nthe delivery of mitophagosomes to lysosomes, and promoted the clearance of \ndamaged mitochondria during subsequent CCCP treatment. IPC also suppressed \nmitochondrial depolarization, improved ATP production, and inhibited the \ngeneration of reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Pink1 suppressed mitophagy \nand reduced the cytoprotective effect of IPC.

This study is focused on apoptosis and transcriptional profiling \nof FIPV-infected cells following in vitro infection of CRFK cells with FIPV \n79-1146 WSU. Flow cytometry was used to determine mode of cell death in first \n42 h post infection (hpi). FIPV infected cells underwent early apoptosis at 9 \nhpi (p < 0.05) followed by late apoptosis at 12 hpi (p < 0.05) and necrosis from \n24 hpi (p < 0.05). Then, next generation sequencing was performed on 9 hpi and \ncontrol uninfected cells by Illumina analyzer. An aggregate of 4546 genes (2229 \ndown-regulated and 2317 up-regulated) from 17 cellular process, 11 molecular \nfunctions and 130 possible biological pathways were affected by FIPV. 131 genes \nfrom apoptosis cluster (80 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated) along with \nincrease of apoptosis, p53, p38 MAPK, VEGF and chemokines/cytokines signaling \npathways were probably involved in apoptosis process. Six of the de-regulated \ngenes expression (RASSF1, BATF2, MAGEB16, PDCD5, TNFα and TRAF2) and TNFα \nprotein concentration were analyzed by RT-qPCR and ELISA, respectively, at \ndifferent time-points. Up-regulations of both pro-apoptotic (i.e. PDCD5) and \nanti-apoptotic (i.e. TRAF2) were detected from first hpi and continuing to \nderegulate during apoptosis process in the infected cells.",

HGF and its \nreceptor MET play critical roles in liver carcinogenesis and metastasis, mainly \ndependent on the activity of receptor tyrosine kinase. However, for unknown \nreasons, all HGF-MET kinase activity-targeted drugs have failed or have been \nsuspended in clinical trials thus far. Macroautophagy/autophagy is a protective \n'self-eating' process for resisting metabolic stress by recycling obsolete \ncomponents, whereas the impact of autophagy-mediated reprogrammed metabolism on \ntherapeutic resistance is largely unclear, especially in liver cancer. In the \npresent study, we first observed that HGF stimulus facilitated the Warburg \neffect and glutaminolysis to promote biogenesis in multiple liver cancer cells. \nWe then identified the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and GLS/GLS1 as \ncrucial substrates of HGF-activated MET kinase; MET-mediated phosphorylation \ninhibits PDHC activity but activates GLS to promote cancer cell metabolism and \nbiogenesis. We further found that the key residues of kinase activity in MET \n(Y1234/1235) also constitute a conserved LC3-interacting region motif \n(Y1234-Y1235-x-V1237). Therefore, on inhibiting HGF-mediated MET kinase \nactivation, Y1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET induced autophagy to maintain \nbiogenesis for cancer cell survival. Moreover, we verified that \nY1234/1235-dephosphorylated MET correlated with autophagy in clinical liver \ncancer. Finally, a combination of MET inhibitor and autophagy suppressor \nsignificantly improved the therapeutic efficiency of liver cancer in vitro and \nin mice. Together, our findings reveal an HGF-MET axis-coordinated functional \ninteraction between tyrosine kinase signaling and autophagy, and establish a \nMET-autophagy double-targeted strategy to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance \nin liver cancer.",

In this study, we initially found that oroxylin A (OA) protected \nCCl4-induced liver injury accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) \nactivation of HSCs in mice. In vitro, OA treatment markedly reduced fibrogenesis \nby modulating extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation.

Using the \neIF2α dephosphorylation inhibitor salubrinal, we found that ERS pathway \nactivation was required for OA to induce HSC apoptosis. ERS-related proteins \nwere significantly upregulated by OA treatment, and salubrinal abrogated the \neffects of OA on HSCs. Thus, we inferred that OA attenuated HSC activation by \npromoting ERS.

Consistent with suggestions that lifetime stress may be \nan important AD precipitating factor, we previously reported that environmental \nstress and high glucocorticoid (GC) levels induce accumulation of aggregated \nTau; however, the molecular mechanisms for such process remain unclear. Herein, \nwe monitor a novel interplay between RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and autophagic \nmachinery in the underlying mechanisms through which chronic stress and high GC \nlevels impact on Tau proteostasis precipitating Tau aggregation. Using \nmolecular, pharmacological and behavioral analysis, we demonstrate that chronic \nstress and high GC trigger mTOR-dependent inhibition of autophagy, leading to \naccumulation of Tau aggregates and cell death in P301L-Tau expressing mice and \ncells. In parallel, we found that environmental stress and GC disturb cellular \nhomeostasis and trigger the insoluble accumulation of different RBPs, such as \nPABP, G3BP1, TIA-1, and FUS, shown to form stress granules (SGs) and Tau \naggregation. Interestingly, an mTOR-driven pharmacological stimulation of \nautophagy attenuates the GC-driven accumulation of Tau and SG-related proteins \nas well as the related cell death, suggesting a critical interface between \nautophagy and the response of the SG-related protein in the neurodegenerative \npotential of chronic stress and GC. These studies provide novel insights into \nthe RNA-protein intracellular signaling regulating the precipitating role of \nenvironmental stress and GC on Tau-driven brain pathology.",

Although the role of \nlong noncoding RNA in regulating cell fate has received widespread attention, \nlong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that can both regulate autophagy and apoptosis \nneed to be discovered. In this study, we identified that a small chemical \nmolecule, 3-benzyl-5-([2-nitrophenoxy] methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO), \nsynthesized by us, could inhibit VEC autophagy and apoptosis induced by a high \nconcentration of glucose. To find new lncRNAs that regulate autophagy and \napoptosis in VECs, we performed lncRNA microarray analysis. We found and \nverified an upregulated lncRNA named CA7-4 that was induced by a high \nconcentration of glucose could be downregulated by 3BDO most obviously among all \nof the detected lncRNAs. Meanwhile, we investigated the mechanism of CA7-4 in \nregulating VEC autophagy and apoptosis. The results showed that CA7-4 \nfacilitated endothelial autophagy and apoptosis as a competing endogenous RNA \n(ceRNA) by decoying MIR877-3P and MIR5680. Further study elucidated that \nMIR877-3P could trigger the decrease of CTNNBIP1 (catenin beta interacting \nprotein 1) by combining with its 3' UTR and then upregulating CTNNB1 (catenin \nbeta 1); MIR5680 inhibited the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase \n(AMPK) by targeting and decreasing DPP4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4). Therefore, \nCA7-4, MIR877-3P and MIR5680 represent new signal pathways that regulate VEC \nautophagy and apoptosis under the high-glucose condition.",

Here we report that the \ninhibition of mutated EGFR promotes the secretion of a potent vasoconstrictor, \nendothelin-1 (EDN1), which continues to increase as the cells become resistant \nwith a mesenchymal phenotype. As EDN1 and its receptor (EDNR) is linked to \ncancer progression, EDNR-antagonists have been evaluated in several clinical \ntrials with disappointing results. These trials were based on a hypothesis that \nthe EDN1-EDNR axis activates the MAPK-ERK signaling pathway that is vital to the \ncancer cell survival; the trials were not designed to evaluate the impact of \ntumor-derived EDN1 in modifying tumor microenvironment or contributing to drug \nresistance. Ectopic overexpression of EDN1 in cells with mutated EGFR resulted \nin poor drug delivery and retarded growth in vivo but not in vitro. Intratumoral \ninjection of recombinant EDN significantly reduced blood flow and subsequent \ngefitinib accumulation in xenografted EGFR-mutant tumors. Furthermore, depletion \nof EDN1 or the use of endothelin receptor inhibitors bosentan and ambrisentan \nimproved drug penetration into tumors and restored blood flow in \ntumor-associated vasculature.

The relatively small fraction of chemo-resistant \ncancer cells outgrows and are responsible for tumor relapse, with acquired \ninvasiveness and stemness. We demonstrate that zinc-finger MYND type-8 (ZMYND8), \na putative chromatin reader, suppresses stemness, drug resistance, and \ntumor-promoting genes, which are hallmarks of cancer. Reinstating ZMYND8 \nsuppresses chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin-induced tumorigenic potential (at a \nsublethal dose) and drug resistance, thereby resetting the transcriptional \nprogram of cells to the epithelial state. The ability of ZMYND8 to \nchemo-sensitize doxorubicin-treated metastatic breast cancer cells by \ndownregulating tumor-associated genes was further confirmed by transcriptome \nanalysis. Interestingly, we observed that ZMYND8 overexpression in \ndoxorubicin-treated cells stimulated those involved in a good prognosis in \nbreast cancer. Consistently, sensitizing the cancer cells with ZMYND8 followed \nby doxorubicin treatment led to tumor regression in vivo and revert back the \nphenotypes associated with drug resistance and stemness. Intriguingly, ZMYND8 \nmodulates the bivalent or poised oncogenes through its association with KDM5C \nand EZH2, thereby chemo-sensitizing the cells to chemotherapy for better \ndisease-free survival. Collectively, our findings indicate that poised chromatin \nis instrumental for the acquisition of chemo-resistance by cancer cells and \npropose ZMYND8 as a suitable epigenetic tool that can re-sensitize the \nchemo-refractory breast carcinoma.",

The activity of mammalian sterile20-like kinases (MST1/2) has been \nlinked to apoptosis and tumor suppression via YAP/Hippo pathway-independent and \n-dependent mechanisms. Using a kinase substrate screen, we identified here MST1 \nand MST2 among the top substrates for fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 \n(FGFR4). In COS-1 cells, MST1 was phosphorylated at Y433 residue in an FGFR4 \nkinase activity-dependent manner, as assessed by mass spectrometry.

Unexpectedly, MST2 \nwas also essential for this MST1/N activation and coincident apoptosis \ninduction, although these two kinases, as well as YAP, were differentially \nregulated in the breast cancer models analyzed. Moreover, pharmacological FGFR4 \ninhibition specifically sensitized the HER2+ MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, not \nonly to HER2/EGFR and AKT/mTOR inhibitors, but also to clinically relevant \napoptosis modulators. In TCGA cohort, FGFR4 overexpression correlated with \nabysmal HER2+ breast carcinoma patient outcome. Therefore, our results uncover a \nclinically relevant, targetable mechanism of FGFR4 oncogenic activity via \nsuppression of the stress-associated MST1/2-induced apoptosis machinery in tumor \ncells with prominent HER/ERBB and FGFR4 signaling-driven proliferation.",

Most cells maintain telomere \nrepeat lengths by using the enzyme telomerase, although there are some cancer \ncells that use a telomerase-independent mechanism of telomere extension, termed \nalternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Cells that use ALT are \ncharacterized, in part, by the presence of specialized PML nuclear bodies called \nALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs localize to and cluster telomeric ends \ntogether with telomeric and DNA damage factors, which led to the proposal that \nthese bodies act as a platform on which ALT can occur. However, the necessity of \nAPBs and their function in the ALT pathway has remained unclear. Here, we used \nCRISPR/Cas9 to delete PML and APB components from ALT-positive cells to cleanly \ndefine the function of APBs in ALT. We found that PML is required for the ALT \nmechanism, and that this necessity stems from APBs' role in localizing the \nBLM-TOP3A-RMI (BTR) complex to ALT telomere ends.

Both enzymes induced caspase cleavage and \nactivation, chromatin condensation and phosphatidylserine exposure, indicating \napoptosis. Both arginase- and asparaginase-induced death were blocked by caspase \ninhibitors, but with different sensitivities. BCL-2 overexpression inhibited \narginase- and asparaginase-induced cell death, but did not prevent \narginase-induced cytostasis, indicating a different mechanism of growth arrest. \nAn autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine, had no effect on the cell death induced by \narginase, but doubled the cell death induced by asparaginase. In conclusion, \narginase causes death of lymphoblasts by arginine-depletion induced apoptosis, \nvia mechanism distinct from asparaginase. Therapeutic implications for childhood \nALL include: arginase might be used as treatment (but antagonised by dietary \narginine and citrulline), chloroquine may enhance efficacy of asparaginase \ntreatment, and partial resistance to arginase and asparaginase may develop by \nBCL-2 expression. Arginase or asparaginase might potentially be used to treat \nBurkitt lymphoma.",

In this study, \nwe aim to investigate the protective effects of baicalein on liver injury \ninduced by oxidative stress.

The protective effect of \nbaicalein on oxidative stress-induced liver injury was evaluated by detecting \nthe mitochondrial dynamics, the level of autophagy and apoptosis, the \nhistopathology of liver, the indicators of liver function, and the level of \noxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. March5 is the key regulator during liver \ninjury induced by oxidative stress. March5 can ubiquitinate Drp1 and promote \nDrp1 degradation, then maintain the homeostasis of mitochondrial dynamics, keep \nthe balance of autophagy, and reduce apoptosis. Baicalein is able to effectively \nreduce liver injury; it can contribute to the expression of March5 by regulating \nKLF4 during liver injury. These results indicate that baicalein plays a key role \nin salvaging liver from injury induced by oxidative stress via regulating the \nKLF4-March5-Drp1 signal pathway.",

            "TEXT": "Abdominal paracentesis drainage attenuates severe acute pancreatitis by \nenhancing cell apoptosis via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n\nOur previous studies have shown that abdominal paracentesis drainage (APD) is a \nsafe and effective strategy for patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). \nHowever, the underlying mechanisms behind APD treatment remain poorly \nunderstood. Given that apoptosis is a critical pathological response of SAP, we \nhere aim to investigate the effect of APD on cell apoptosis in pancreatic \ntissues during SAP and to explore its potential molecular mechanism. SAP was \ninduced by 5% sodium-taurocholate retrograde while APD group was inserted a \ndrainage tube into the right lower abdomen of rats immediately after SAP \ninduction. Histopathological staining, serum amylase, endotoxin and inflammatory \nmediators were measured. Cell apoptosis, apoptosis-related proteins and \nsignaling pathway were also evaluated. Our results demonstrated that APD \ntreatment significantly attenuated pancreatic damage and decreased the serum \nlevels of amylase, endotoxin, TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 in rats with SAP. Notably, \nAPD treatment enhanced cell apoptosis and reduced necrosis in pancreatic \ntissues, as evidenced by Tunnel staining, the increased pro-apoptosis proteins \n(Cleaved-caspase-3 and bax) and decreased anti-apoptosis protein (Bcl-2). \nMoreover, the effect of APD on cell apoptosis was further confirmed by the \nregulatory pathway of PI3K/AKT and NF-kB signaling pathway. These results \nsuggest that APD attenuates the severity of SAP by enhancing cell apoptosis via \nsuppressing PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our findings provide new insights for \nunderstanding the effectiveness of APD in patients with SAP.",

Notably, myofiber necrosis was preceded by upregulation of \nLGALS3/Galectin-3, a marker of damaged lysosomes, and TFEB activation, \nsuggesting early defects in the lysosomal system. Consistent with that, myofiber \nnecrosis was recapitulated by chemical induction of lysosomal membrane \npermeabilization (LMP) in skeletal muscle. Moreover, TFEB was activated after \nLMP in cells, but activation and nuclear localization of TFEB persisted upon VCP \ninactivation or disease mutant expression.

However, the precise \nmechanisms underlying mitophagy remain largely unknown. Prior studies on \nmitophagy focused on the events in the mitochondrial outer membrane. PHB2 \n(prohibitin 2), which is a highly conserved membrane scaffold protein, was \nrecently identified as a novel inner membrane mitophagy receptor that mediates \nmitophagy. Here, we report a new signaling pathway for PHB2-mediated mitophagy. \nUpon mitochondrial membrane depolarization or misfolded protein aggregation, \nPHB2 depletion destabilizes PINK1 in the mitochondria, which blocks the \nmitochondrial recruitment of PRKN/Parkin, ubiquitin and OPTN (optineurin), \nleading to an inhibition of mitophagy. In addition, PHB2 overexpression directly \ninduces PRKN recruitment to the mitochondria. Moreover, PHB2-mediated mitophagy \nis dependent on the mitochondrial inner membrane protease PARL, which interacts \nwith PHB2 and is activated upon PHB2 depletion. Furthermore, PGAM5, which is \nprocessed by PARL, participates in PHB2-mediated PINK1 stabilization. Finally, a \nligand of PHB proteins that we synthesized, called FL3, was found to strongly \ninhibit PHB2-mediated mitophagy and to effectively block cancer cell growth and \nenergy production at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, our findings reveal that \nthe PHB2-PARL-PGAM5-PINK1 axis is a novel pathway of PHB2-mediated mitophagy and \nthat targeting PHB2 with the chemical compound FL3 is a promising strategy for \ncancer therapy.",

Here, we first show that SLC27A5 expression is downregulated in \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by DNA hypermethylation, and reduced SCL27A5 \nexpression contributes to tumor progression and poor prognosis. Both gain- and \nloss-of-function studies demonstrated that SLC27A5 has an antiproliferative \neffect on HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Knockout of SLC27A5 increases \npolyunsaturated lipids, leading to increased NADP+/NADPH ratio, ROS production \nas well as lipid peroxidation and the subsequent accumulation of \n4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) in hepatoma cells. Mass spectrometry analysis found \nthat 4-HNE directly modifies cysteine residues (Cys513, 518) on KEAP1, thus \nleading KEAP1/NRF2 pathway activation and increases the expression levels of \nNRF2 target genes, such as TXNRD1. Further, SLC27A5 expression negatively \ncorrelates with TXNRD1 expression in hepatoma cells and clinical HCC samples, \nand blockade of NRF2/TXNRD1 using genetic approaches or inhibitors sensitizes \nSLC27A5-deficient hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment. Collectively, we \ndemonstrated that SLC27A5 acts as a novel tumor suppressor by suppressing TXNRD1 \nexpression via the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in HCC. Combination therapy of sorafenib \nand NRF2/TXNRD1 inhibitors may be a promising strategy in personalized HCC \ntreatment.",

            "TEXT": "Extracellular Vesicle-Derived miR-124 Resolves Radiation-Induced Brain Injury.\n\nRadiation-induced cognitive dysfunction (RICD) is a progressive and debilitating \nhealth issue facing patients following cranial radiotherapy to control central \nnervous system cancers. There has been some success treating RICD in rodents \nusing human neural stem cell (hNSC) transplantation, but the procedure is \ninvasive, requires immunosuppression, and could cause other complications such \nas teratoma formation. Extracellular vesicles (EV) are nanoscale membrane-bound \nstructures that contain biological contents including mRNA, miRNA, proteins, and \nlipids that can be readily isolated from conditioned culture media. It has been \npreviously shown that hNSC-derived EV resolves RICD following cranial \nirradiation using an immunocompromised rodent model. Here, we use \nimmunocompetent wild-type mice to show that hNSC-derived EV treatment \nadministered either intravenously via retro-orbital vein injection or via \nintracranial transplantation can ameliorate cognitive deficits following 9 Gy \nhead-only irradiation. Cognitive function assessed on the novel place \nrecognition, novel object recognition, and temporal order tasks was not only \nimproved at early (5 weeks) but also at delayed (6 months) postirradiation times \nwith just a single EV treatment. Improved behavioral outcomes were also \nassociated with reduced neuroinflammation as measured by a reduction in \nactivated microglia. To identify the mechanism of action, analysis of EV cargo \nimplicated miRNA (miR-124) as a potential candidate in the mitigation of RICD. \nFurthermore, viral vector-mediated overexpression of miR-124 in the irradiated \nbrain ameliorated RICD and reduced microglial activation. Our findings \ndemonstrate for the first time that systemic administration of hNSC-derived EV \nabrogates RICD and neuroinflammation in cranially irradiated wild-type rodents \nthrough a mechanism involving miR-124.",

The proteasome-dependent pathway is one of the main modalities in \ncontrolling KLF4 abundance at a posttranslational level. Although some of the \nubiquitin ligases have been identified, the deubiquitinases of KLF4 and the \nregulatory function remain unexplored. Here, by screening ubiquitin-specific \nproteases that may interact with KLF4, we found ubiquitin-specific peptidase 10 \n(USP10) as a deubiquitinating enzyme for KLF4. Forced expression of USP10 \nremarkably increases KLF4 protein level by blocking the latter degradation, \nwhereas the depletion of USP10 promotes KLF4 degradation and thus enhances \ntumorigenesis. Loss of USP10 in mice downregulates KLF4 expression and \naccelerates KrasG12D-driven lung adenocarcinoma initiation and progression. In \naddition, our data revealed that KLF4 can facilitate the transcription of tumor \nsuppressor TIMP3 by directly binding to the TIMP3 promoter. Clinically, \nreduction of USP10 expression, concomitant with decreased KLF4 and TIMP3 \nabundance in carcinoma tissue, predicts poor prognosis of lung cancer patient. \nTaken together, our results demonstrate that USP10 is a critical regulator of \nKLF4, pinpointing USP10-KLF4-TIMP3 axis as a promising therapeutic target in \nlung cancer.",

However, the mechanism underlying this dysregulation, particularly in \nhuman cells, remains poorly understood. Mutations in the small GTPase gene \nRAB39b are associated with X-linked macrocephaly, autism spectrum disorder \n(ASD), and intellectual disability. The in vivo roles of RAB39b in the brain \nremain unknown. We generated Rab39b knockout (KO) mice and found that they \nexhibited cortical neurogenesis impairment, macrocephaly, and hallmark ASD \nbehaviors, which resembled patient phenotypes. We also produced mutant human \ncerebral organoids that were substantially enlarged due to the overproliferation \nand impaired differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which resemble \nneurodevelopmental deficits in KO mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that RAB39b \ninteracts with PI3K components and its deletion promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling \nin NPCs of mouse cortex and cerebral organoids. The mTOR activity is robustly \nenhanced in mutant outer radial glia cells (oRGs), a subtype of NPCs barely \ndetectable in rodents but abundant in human brains. Inhibition of AKT signaling \nrescued enlarged organoid sizes and NPC overproliferation caused by RAB39b \nmutations. Therefore, RAB39b mutation promotes PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity and alters \ncortical neurogenesis, leading to macrocephaly and autistic-like behaviors. Our \nstudies provide new insights into neurodevelopmental dysregulation and common \npathways associated with ASD across species.",

            "TEXT": "Impact of elevated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-2 on the development and \ntreatment of MLL-AF9 AML in mice.\n\nMany acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) express high levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1, \nespecially after therapy. To test the impact of these anti-apoptotic proteins on \nAML development and treatment, we used haemopoietic reconstitution to generate \nMLL-AF9 AMLs expressing BCL-2 or Mcl-1 transgenes. AMLs with elevated BCL-2 or \nMCL-1 had a higher proportion of mature myeloid cells but, like conventional \nMLL-AF9 AMLs, were readily transplantable. Short-term cell lines established \nfrom multiple primary AMLs of each genotype were tested in vitro for \nsusceptibility to chemotherapeutics currently used for treating AML \n(daunorubicin, etoposide, cytarabine); the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib; \nCDK7/9 inhibitors; and BH3 mimetics, which bind and inhibit pro-survival \nproteins. The BH3 mimetics tested, alone and in combination with the other \ndrugs, were: ABT-737 which, like its clinical counterpart navitoclax, targets \nBCL-2, BCL-XL and BCL-W; BCL-2-specific ABT-199 (venetoclax); BCL-XL-specific \nA-1331852; and S63845, a new MCL-1-specific BH3 mimetic. As single agents, \ndaunorubicin and bortezomib had the greatest efficacy. Elevated MCL-1 or BCL-2 \nreduced sensitivity to daunorubicin but, surprisingly, not to bortezomib. MCL-1 \nmarkedly enhanced resistance to ABT-737 and ABT-199 but not S63845, and BCL-2 \nincreased resistance to S63845 but not to ABT-737 or ABT-199. Notable synergies \nwere achieved by combining BH3 mimetics with daunorubicin: S63845 increased the \nsensitivity of both MCL-1 and BCL-2 overexpressing MLL-AF9 AMLs, and ABT-737 \naided in killing those overexpressing BCL-2. Synergy between daunorubicin and \nABT-199 was also apparent in vivo, although not curative. Impressive synergistic \nresponses were achieved for human MLL-fusion AML cell lines treated with \ndaunorubicin plus either ABT-737, ABT-199 or S63845, and with ABT-199 plus \nS63845, with or without daunorubicin. Our data suggest that AML patients may \nbenefit from combining conventional cytotoxic drugs with BH3 mimetics targeting \nBCL-2 or MCL-1 or, if tolerated, both these agents.",

Although Wnt signaling \nhas been intensively studied in colorectal cancer, it remains unclear whether \nactivity in the tumor-associated stroma contributes to malignancy. To \nspecifically interfere with stromal signals, we generated Wnt-independent tumor \norganoids that secrete the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1. Subcutaneous transplantation \ninto immunocompetent as well as immunodeficient mice resulted in a strong \nreduction of tumor growth. Histologic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that \nSfrp1 induced an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in tumor \ncells without affecting tumor-intrinsic Wnt signaling, suggesting involvement of \nnonimmune stromal cells. Blockage of canonical signaling using Sfrp1, Dkk1, or \nfibroblast-specific genetic ablation of β-catenin strongly decreased the number \nof cancer-associated myofibroblasts (myCAF). Wnt activity in CAFs was linked \nwith distinct subtypes, where low and high levels induced an inflammatory-like \nCAF (iCAF) subtype or contractile myCAFs, respectively. Coculture of tumor \norganoids with iCAFs resulted in significant upregulation of EMT markers, while \nmyCAFs reverted this phenotype. In summary, we show that tumor growth and \nmalignancy are differentially regulated via distinct fibroblast subtypes under \nthe influence of juxtacrine Wnt signals.",

In \naddition, SPHK1 deficiency reduced the levels of histone deacetylase and \npromoted the acetylation of p65 and STAT1, thereby impairing the transcription \nof inflammatory genes. Supplementation with exogenous S1P significantly reversed \nthe activation of the PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway and ATF6 during ER stress as well \nas the activation of GSK3β, ASK1, and JNK during MPT. Both FTY720, a functional \nS1P receptor antagonist, and PF543, an SPHK1 inhibitor, significantly \nameliorated APAP-induced liver injury and improved animal survival. Our study \nreveals a critical role for SPHK1 in mediating APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by \npromoting ER stress and MPT.",

A gradual decrease of \nMETTL14 (methyltransferase like 14) and an increase of ALKBH5 (alkB homolog 5, \nRNA demethylase) were observed in LCs during their differentiation from stem LCs \nto adult LCs. These events led to reduced mRNA methylation levels of \nN6-methyladenosine (m6A) and enhanced autophagy in LCs. Similar regulation of \nMETTL14, ALKBH5, and m6A was also observed in LCs upon treatment with human \nchorionic gonadotropin (HsCG). Mechanistically, m6A modification promoted \ntranslation of PPM1A (protein phosphatase 1A, magnesium dependent, alpha \nisoform), a negative AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulator, but \ndecreased expression of CAMKK2 (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase \nkinase 2, beta), a positive AMPK regulator, by reducing its RNA stability. Thus, \nm6A modification resulted in reduced AMPK activity and subsequent autophagy \ninhibition. We further demonstrated that ALKBH5 upregulation by HsCG was \ndependent on enhanced binding of the transcriptional factor CEBPB \n(CCAAT/enhancer binding protein [C/EBP], beta) and the TFEB (transcription \nfactor EB) to its gene promoter. Moreover, HsCG treatment decreased METTL14 by \nreducing its stability. Collectively, this study highlights a vital role of m6A \nRNA methylation in the modulation of testosterone synthesis in LCs, providing \ninsight into novel therapeutic strategies by exploiting m6A RNA methylation as \ntargets for treating azoospermatism and oligospermatism patients with reduction \nin serum testosterone.",

In \nbreast cancer cells, ER genomic binding is enabled by FOXA1 and GATA3, but the \ntranscription factors that control ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer \ncells remain unknown. We previously identified ETV4 as a candidate factor \ncontrolling ER genomic binding in endometrial cancer cells, and here we explore \nthe functional importance of ETV4. Homozygous deletion of ETV4, using \nCRISPR/Cas9, led to greatly reduced ER binding at the majority of loci normally \nbound by ER. Consistent with the dramatic loss of ER binding, the gene \nexpression response to estradiol was dampened for most genes. ETV4 contributes \nto estrogen signaling in two distinct ways. ETV4 loss affects chromatin \naccessibility at some ER bound loci and impairs ER nuclear translocation. The \ndiminished estrogen signaling upon ETV4 deletion led to decreased growth, \nparticularly in 3D culture, where hollow organoids were formed and in vivo in \nthe context of estrogen-dependent growth. These results show that ETV4 plays an \nimportant role in estrogen signaling in endometrial cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: \nEstrogen receptor alpha (ER) is a key oncogene in endometrial cancer.

The post-translational phosphorylation modulations of TFEB by mTOR \nand ERK signaling can determine its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and activity in \nresponse to nutrient availability. However, regulations of TFEB at translational \nlevel are rarely known. Here, we found that programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a \ntumor suppressor, decreased levels of nuclear TFEB to inhibit lysosome \nbiogenesis and function. Mechanistically, PDCD4 reduces global pool of TFEB by \nsuppressing TFEB translation in an eIF4A-dependent manner, rather than \ninfluencing mTOR- and ERK2-dependnet TFEB nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Both of \nMA3 domains within PDCD4 are required for TFEB translation inhibition. \nFurthermore, TFEB is required for PDCD4-mediated lysosomal function suppression. \nIn the tumor microenvironment, PDCD4 deficiency promotes the anti-tumor effect \nof macrophage via enhancing TFEB expression. Our research reveals a novel \nPDCD4-dependent TFEB translational regulation and supports PDCD4 as a potential \ntherapeutic target for lysosome dysfunction related diseases.",

Ferroptosis is a type of regulated \ncell death (RCD) found in various diseases. However, the underlying molecular \nmechanisms related to ferroptosis in renal I/R injury remain unclear. In the \npresent study, we investigated the regulatory role of microRNAs on ferroptosis \nin I/R-induced renal injury. We established the I/R-induced renal injury model \nin rats, and H/R induced HK-2 cells injury in vitro. CCK-8 was used to measure \ncell viability. Fe2+ and ROS levels were assayed to evaluate the activation of \nferroptosis. We performed RNA sequencing to profile the miRNAs expression in \nH/R-induced injury and ferroptosis. Western blot analysis was used to detect the \nprotein expression. qRT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA and miRNA levels in \ncells and tissues. We further used luciferase reporter assay to verify the \ndirect targeting effect of miRNA. We found that ischemia/reperfusion-induced \nferroptosis in rat's kidney. We identified that miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p were \nupregulated in the ferroptosis and H/R-induced injury, and correlates reversely \nwith glutathione peroxidases 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 \n(SLC7A11) expression in renal I/R injury tissues, respectively. In vitro studies \nshowed that miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p induced ferroptosis in cells. We further \nfound that miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p regulated the expression of GPX4 and \nSLC7A11 negatively by directly binding to the 3'UTR of GPX4 and SLC7A11 mRNA. In \nvivo study showed that silencing miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p alleviated the \nI/R-induced renal injury in rats. In conclusion, we demonstrated that I/R \ninduced upregulation of miR-182-5p and miR-378a-3p, leading to activation of \nferroptosis in renal injury through downregulation of GPX4 and SLC7A11.",

            "TEXT": "UBR5 Is Coamplified with MYC in Breast Tumors and Encodes an Ubiquitin Ligase \nThat Limits MYC-Dependent Apoptosis.\n\nFor maximal oncogenic activity, cellular MYC protein levels need to be tightly \ncontrolled so that they do not induce apoptosis. Here, we show how ubiquitin \nligase UBR5 functions as a molecular rheostat to prevent excess accumulation of \nMYC protein. UBR5 ubiquitinates MYC and its effects on MYC protein stability are \nindependent of FBXW7. Silencing of endogenous UBR5 induced MYC protein \nexpression and regulated MYC target genes. Consistent with the tumor suppressor \nfunction of UBR5 (HYD) in Drosophila, HYD suppressed dMYC-dependent overgrowth \nof wing imaginal discs. In contrast, in cancer cells, UBR5 suppressed \nMYC-dependent priming to therapy-induced apoptosis. Of direct cancer relevance, \nMYC and UBR5 genes were coamplified in MYC-driven human cancers. Functionally, \nUBR5 suppressed MYC-mediated apoptosis in p53-mutant breast cancer cells with \nUBR5/MYC coamplification. Furthermore, single-cell immunofluorescence analysis \ndemonstrated reciprocal expression of UBR5 and MYC in human basal-type breast \ncancer tissues. In summary, UBR5 is a novel MYC ubiquitin ligase and an \nendogenous rheostat for MYC activity. In MYC-amplified, and p53-mutant breast \ncancer cells, UBR5 has an important role in suppressing MYC-mediated apoptosis \npriming and in protection from drug-induced apoptosis.

We used \nquantitative mass spectrometry to analyze the extracellular matrix (ECM), a \ncritical component of metastatic niches, in metastases to the brain, lungs, \nliver, and bone marrow, all derived from parental MDA-MB-231 triple-negative \nbreast cancer cells.

In addition, tumor and stromal cells \ntogether created distinct niches in each tissue. Downregulation of SERPINB1, a \nprotein elevated in brain metastases, led to a reduction in brain metastasis, \nsuggesting that some niche-specific ECM proteins may be involved in metastatic \ntropism. SIGNIFICANCE: Tumor and stromal cells together create distinct ECM \nniches in breast cancer metastases to various tissues, providing new insight \ninto how tumor cells adapt to survive in different tissue environments.",

Here we \nfirst demonstrated that PD-L1 expression levels were positively correlated with \np-MerTK levels in patient samples and NSCLC cell lines. In addition, PD-L1 \nknockdown led to the reduced phosphorylation level of MerTK in vitro. We next \nshowed that PD-L1 regulated NSCLC cell proliferation via Gas6/MerTK signaling \npathway in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we \nunexpectedly found that PD-L1 translocated into the nucleus of cancer cells \nwhich was facilitated through the binding of Karyopherin β1 (KPNB1). Nuclear \nPD-L1 (nPD-L1), coupled with transcription factor Sp1, regulated the synthesis \nof Gas6 mRNA and promoted Gas6 secretion to activate MerTK signaling pathway. \nTaken together, our results shed light on the novel role of nPD-L1 in NSCLC cell \nproliferation and reveal a new molecular mechanism underlying nPD-L1-mediated \nGas6/MerTK signaling activation. All above findings provide the possible \ncombinational implications for PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy in the clinic.",

Most patients present with \ndisseminated disease and the majority are offered palliative chemotherapy. With \nno approved treatment modalities for patients who progress on chemotherapy, we \nexplored the effects of long-term gemcitabine administration on the tumor \nmicroenvironment to identify potential therapeutic options for chemorefractory \nPDAC. Using a combination of mouse models, primary cell line-derived xenografts, \nand established tumor cell lines, we first evaluated chemotherapy-induced \nalterations in the tumor secretome and immune surface proteins by high \nthroughput proteomic arrays.

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which is \nelevated in non-healed diabetic wound, is necessary for healing process but its \nabnormality resulted in a delayed healing.

In order to provide an unbiased and \nglobal view of the DNA damage response in human cells, we undertook 31 \nCRISPR-Cas9 screens against 27 genotoxic agents in the retinal pigment \nepithelium-1 (RPE1) cell line. These screens identified 890 genes whose loss \ncauses either sensitivity or resistance to DNA-damaging agents.

Using preclinical models, we show that RMC-4550, an \nallosteric inhibitor of SHP2, induces antitumor immunity, with effects \nequivalent to or greater than those resulting from checkpoint blockade. In the \ntumor microenvironment, inhibition of SHP2 modulated T-cell infiltrates similar \nto checkpoint blockade. In addition, RMC-4550 drove direct, selective depletion \nof protumorigenic M2 macrophages via attenuation of CSF1 receptor signaling and \nincreased M1 macrophages via a mechanism independent of CD8+ T cells or IFNγ. \nThese dramatic shifts in polarized macrophage populations in favor of antitumor \nimmunity were not seen with checkpoint blockade.

However, the specific \nmolecular mechanisms through which acetyl-CoA production impacts gene expression \nand its functional roles in promoting malignant phenotypes are poorly \nunderstood. Here, using histone H3 Lys27 acetylation (H3K27ac) ChIP-seq \n(chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] coupled with next-generation sequencing) \nwith normalization to an exogenous reference genome (ChIP-Rx), we found that \nchanges in acetyl-CoA abundance trigger site-specific regulation of H3K27ac, \ncorrelating with gene expression as opposed to uniformly modulating this mark at \nall genes. Genes involved in integrin signaling and cell adhesion were \nidentified as acetyl-CoA-responsive in glioblastoma cells, and we demonstrate \nthat ATP citrate lyase (ACLY)-dependent acetyl-CoA production promotes cell \nmigration and adhesion to the extracellular matrix. Mechanistically, the \ntranscription factor NFAT1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells 1) was found to \nmediate acetyl-CoA-dependent gene regulation and cell adhesion. This occurs \nthrough modulation of Ca2+ signals, triggering NFAT1 nuclear translocation when \nacetyl-CoA is abundant. The findings of this study thus establish that \nacetyl-CoA impacts H3K27ac at specific loci, correlating with gene expression, \nand that expression of cell adhesion genes are driven by acetyl-CoA in part \nthrough activation of Ca2+-NFAT signaling.",

Furthermore, selective \ndeletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin \nD-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. \nMechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, \nPparg, and Arg1.

In \nmice lacking Ebf1 and Ebf3, CAR/LepR+ cells exhibiting a normal morphology are \nabundantly present, but their niche function is markedly impaired with depleted \nHSCs in infant marrow. Subsequently, the mutants become progressively more \nosteosclerotic, leading to the complete occlusion of marrow cavities in early \nadulthood.

However, the regulation of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells \nis still poorly understood. Here we show that intratumoral copper levels \ninfluence PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. Deep analysis of the The Cancer \nGenome Atlas database and tissue microarrays showed strong correlation between \nthe major copper influx transporter copper transporter 1 (CTR-1) and PD-L1 \nexpression across many cancers but not in corresponding normal tissues. Copper \nsupplementation enhanced PD-L1 expression at mRNA and protein levels in cancer \ncells and RNA sequencing revealed that copper regulates key signaling pathways \nmediating PD-L1-driven cancer immune evasion. Conversely, copper chelators \ninhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and EGFR and promoted ubiquitin-mediated \ndegradation of PD-L1. Copper-chelating drugs also significantly increased the \nnumber of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T and natural killer cells, slowed tumor \ngrowth, and improved mouse survival. Overall, this study reveals an important \nrole for copper in regulating PD-L1 and suggests that anticancer immunotherapy \nmight be enhanced by pharmacologically reducing intratumor copper levels.",

            "TEXT": "PDK4 promotes vascular calcification by interfering with autophagic activity and \nmetabolic reprogramming.\n\nPyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is an important mitochondrial matrix \nenzyme in cellular energy regulation. Previous studies suggested that PDK4 is \nincreased in the calcified vessels of patients with atherosclerosis and is \nclosely associated with mitochondrial function, but the precise regulatory \nmechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the role of \nPDK4 in vascular calcification and the molecular mechanisms involved. Using a \nvariety of complementary techniques, we found impaired autophagic activity in \nthe process of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) calcification, whereas \nknocking down PDK4 had the opposite effect. PDK4 drives the metabolic \nreprogramming of VSMCs towards a Warburg effect, and the inhibition of PDK4 \nabrogates VSMCs calcification. Mechanistically, PDK4 disturbs the integrity of \nthe mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane, concomitantly \nimpairing mitochondrial respiratory capacity, which contributes to a decrease in \nlysosomal degradation by inhibiting the V-ATPase and lactate dehydrogenase B \ninteraction. PDK4 also inhibits the nuclear translocation of the transcription \nfactor EB, thus inhibiting lysosomal function. These changes result in the \ninterruption of autophagic flux, which accelerates calcium deposition in VSMCs. \nIn addition, glycolysis serves as a metabolic adaptation to improve VSMCs \noxidative stress resistance, whereas inhibition of glycolysis by \n2-deoxy-D-glucose induces the apoptosis of VSMCs and increases the calcium \ndeposition in VSMCs. Our results suggest that PDK4 plays a key role in vascular \ncalcification through autophagy inhibition and metabolic reprogramming.",

Emerging evidence has suggested that circular RNAs \n(circRNAs) have important roles in some biological processes. However, it \nremains unclear whether circRNAs participate in the regulation of autophagy. \nHere we report that a circRNA, termed autophagy-related circular RNA (ACR), \nrepresses autophagy and myocardial infarction by targeting Pink1-mediated \nphosphorylation of FAM65B. ACR attenuates autophagy and cell death in \ncardiomyocytes. Moreover, ACR protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) \ninjury and reduces myocardial infarct sizes. We identify Pink1 as an ACR target \nto mediate the function of ACR in cardiomyocyte autophagy. ACR activates Pink1 \nexpression through directly binding to Dnmt3B and blocking Dnmt3B-mediated DNA \nmethylation of Pink1 promoter. Pink1 suppresses autophagy and Pink1 transgenic \nmice show reduced myocardial infarction sizes. Further, we find that FAM65B is a \ndownstream target of Pink1 and Pink1 phosphorylates FAM65B at serine 46. \nPhosphorylated FAM65B inhibits autophagy and cell death in the heart. Our \nfindings reveal a novel role for the circRNA in regulating autophagy and \nACR-Pink1-FAM65B axis as a regulator of autophagy in the heart will be potential \ntherapeutic targets in treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

Although details of the \nmolecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neuronal death in PD remain \nunclear, neuroinflammation is also considered a potent mediator in the \npathogenesis and progression of PD. In the present study, we present evidences \nthat microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is critical for dopaminergic \nneuronal loss and the subsequent motor deficits in the \n1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. \nSpecifically, NLRP3 deficiency significantly reduces motor dysfunctions and \ndopaminergic neurodegeneration of MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, NLRP3 \ndeficiency abolishes MPTP-induced microglial recruitment, interleukin-1β \nproduction and caspase-1 activation in the SN of mouse brain. In primary \nmicroglia and mixed glial cell cultures, MPTP/ATP treatment promotes the robust \nassembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via producing mitochondrial \nreactive oxygen species. Consistently, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+) \ninduces NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the presence of ATP or nigericin \ntreatment in mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages. These findings reveal a \nnovel priming role of neurotoxin MPTP or MPP+ for NLRP3 activation. \nSubsequently, NLRP3 inflammasome-active microglia induces profound neuronal \ndeath in a microglia-neuron co-culture model. Furthermore, Cx3Cr1CreER-based \nmicroglia-specific expression of an active NLRP3 mutant greatly exacerbates \nmotor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss of MPTP-treated mice.

The transcription factor \nCCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (c/EBPβ) regulates pro-inflammatory genes in \nmicroglia and is upregulated in AD. We show expression of c/EBPβ in microglia is \nregulated post-translationally by the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (also called RFWD2). \nIn the absence of COP1, c/EBPβ accumulates rapidly and drives a potent \npro-inflammatory and neurodegeneration-related gene program, evidenced by \nincreased neurotoxicity in microglia-neuronal co-cultures. Antibody blocking \nstudies reveal that neurotoxicity is almost entirely attributable to complement. \nRemarkably, loss of a single allele of Cebpb prevented the pro-inflammatory \nphenotype. COP1-deficient microglia markedly accelerated tau-mediated \nneurodegeneration in a mouse model where activated microglia play a deleterious \nrole. Thus, COP1 is an important suppressor of pathogenic c/EBPβ-dependent gene \nexpression programs in microglia.",

            "TEXT": "RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis contributes to compression-induced rat \nnucleus pulposus cells death.\n\n\nThe aim of this study was to systematically investigate the role of necroptosis \nin compression-induced rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells death, as well as explore \nthe underlying mechanisms involved. Rat NP cells underwent various periods of \nexposure to 1.0 MPa pressure. Cell viability and cell death were quantified by \nusing cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), and Calcein-AM/propidium iodine (PI) staining \nrespectively. Necroptosis-associated target molecules receptor-interacing \nprotein kinase 1 (RIPK1), phosphorylated RIPK1 (pRIPK1), receptor-interacing \nprotein kinase 3 (RIPK3), phosphorylated RIPK3 (pRIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase \ndomain-like (MLKL) were analyzed by Western-blot and RT-PCR. NP cells were also \nexamined for morphological and ultrastructural changes, which can indicate \nnecroptosis. To indirectly establish the presence of necroptosis, the RIPK1 \nspecific inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872, MLKL \ninhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) were \nutilized. The results established necroptosis was taking place in NP cells. The \nlevel of necroptosis increased in a time-dependent manner, and this effect was \nreduced by Nec-1 in vitro. Additionally, NP cells death were significantly \nattenuated following treatment with Nec-1, GSK'872 or NSA. SiRNA-induced \nknockdown of RIPK3 or MLKL increased cell survival rate, while knockdown of \nRIPK1 resulted in a decreased cell survival rate. In summary, \nRIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis may play an important role in NP cells \ndeath induced by continuous mechanical stress. Treatment strategies which aim to \nregulate necroptosis may prove beneficial, by both reducing NP cells death and \nslowing IVD degeneration.",

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) acquires white adipose tissue (WAT) cell \nfeatures defined as BAT whitening under certain circumstances. The aim of our \ncurrent study was to investigate the possibility and mechanisms of GC-induced \nBAT whitening. Here, we showed that one-week dexamethasone (Dex) treatment \ninduced BAT whitening, characterized by lipid droplet accumulation, in vitro and \nin vivo. Furthermore, autophagy and ATG7 (autophagy related 7) expression was \ninduced in BAT by Dex, and treatment with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine or \nadenovirus-mediated ATG7 knockdown prevented Dex-induced BAT whitening and fat \nmass gain. Moreover, Dex-increased ATG7 expression and autophagy was mediated by \nenhanced expression of BTG1 (B cell translocation gene 1, anti-proliferative) \nthat stimulated activity of CREB1 (cAMP response element binding protein 1). The \nimportance of BTG1 in this regulation was further demonstrated by the observed \nBAT whitening in adipocyte-specific BTG1-overexpressing mice and the attenuated \nDex-induced BAT whitening and fat mass gain in mice with BTG1 knockdown in BAT. \nTaken together, we showed that Dex induces a significant whitening of BAT via \nBTG1- and ATG7-dependent autophagy, which might contribute to Dex-increased \nadiposity. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying \nGC-increased adiposity and possible strategy for preventing GC-induced side \neffects via the combined use of an autophagy inhibitor.",

This study adopts a drug \nrepurposing approach by investigating the anti-cancer activity of a derivative \nof the antipsychotic drug phenothiazine (DS00329) in malignant U251 and U87 \nglioblastoma cells. Results from MTT \n(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and clonogenic \nassays showed that DS00329 inhibited short-term glioblastoma cell viability and \nlong-term survival while sparing non-cancerous cells. Western blot analysis with \nan antibody to γH2AX showed that DS00329 induced DNA damage and flow cytometry \nand western blotting confirmed that it triggered a G1 cell cycle arrest which \ncorrelated with decreased levels in Cyclin A, Cyclin B, Cyclin D1 and cyclin \ndependent kinase 2 and an increase in levels of the cyclin dependent kinase \ninhibitor p21. DS00329 treated glioblastoma cells exhibited morphological and \nmolecular markers typical of apoptotic cells such as membrane blebbing and cell \nshrinkage and an increase in levels of cleaved PARP. Flow cytometry with annexin \nV-FITC/propidium iodide staining confirmed that DS00329 induced apoptotic cell \ndeath in glioblastoma cells. We also show that DS00329 treatment of glioblastoma \ncells led to an increase in the autophagosome marker LC3-II and autophagy \ninhibition studies using bafilomycin A1 and wortmannin, showed that \nDS00329-induced-autophagy was a pro-death mechanism. Furthermore, DS00329 \ntreatment of glioblastoma cells inhibited the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt \ncell survival pathway. Our findings suggest that DS00329 may be an effective \ntreatment for glioblastoma and provide a rationale for further exploration and \nvalidation of the use of phenothiazines and their derivatives in the treatment \nof glioblastoma.",

            "TEXT": "Rationale for targeting BCL6 in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia.\n\nChromosomal rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene occur in \n∼10% of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and define a group of \npatients with dismal outcomes. Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow \nbiopsies from most of these patients revealed aberrant expression of BCL6, a \ntranscription factor that promotes oncogenic B-cell transformation and drug \nresistance in B-ALL. Our genetic and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation \n[ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) analyses showed that MLL-AF4 \nand MLL-ENL fusions directly bound to the BCL6 promoter and up-regulated BCL6 \nexpression. While oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced aberrant BCL6 \nexpression in B-ALL cells, germline MLL was required to up-regulate Bcl6 in \nresponse to physiological stimuli during normal B-cell development. Inducible \nexpression of Bcl6 increased MLL mRNA levels, which was reversed by genetic \ndeletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bcl6, suggesting a positive feedback \nloop between MLL and BCL6. Highlighting the central role of BCL6 in \nMLL-rearranged B-ALL, conditional deletion and pharmacological inhibition of \nBCL6 compromised leukemogenesis in transplant recipient mice and restored \nsensitivity to vincristine chemotherapy in MLL-rearranged B-ALL patient samples. \nOncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced transcriptional activation of the \nproapoptotic BH3-only molecule BIM, while BCL6 was required to curb MLL-induced \nexpression of BIM. Notably, peptide (RI-BPI) and small molecule (FX1) BCL6 \ninhibitors derepressed BIM and synergized with the BH3-mimetic ABT-199 in \neradicating MLL-rearranged B-ALL cells. These findings uncover MLL-dependent \ntranscriptional activation of BCL6 as a previously unrecognized requirement of \nmalignant transformation by oncogenic MLL fusions and identified BCL6 as a novel \ntarget for the treatment of MLL-rearranged B-ALL.",

Therefore, new approaches to target \napoptosis-resistant cancer cells are crucial for the development of directed \ncancer therapies. In the present study, we investigated the effect of cell cycle \nregulators on interferon (IFN)-induced necroptosis as an alternative cell death \nmechanism to overcome apoptosis resistance. Here, we report a novel combination \ntreatment of IFNs with cell cycle arrest-inducing compounds that induce \nnecroptosis in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells and elucidate the underlying \nmolecular mechanisms. Combination treatment of IFNs (i.e. IFNβ) with inhibitors \nof the cell cycle (e.g. vinorelbine (VNR), nocodazole (Noc), polo-like kinase-1 \n(Plk-1) inhibitor BI 6727) co-operate to induce necroptotic cell death upon \ncaspase inactivation. The mode of cell death was confirmed by pharmacological \ninhibition and siRNA-mediated downregulation of the key necroptotic factors \nreceptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase 3 (RIP3) and mixed-lineage kinase-like \n(MLKL) in various cell lines. Mechanistically, we show that necroptosis upon \nVNR/IFNβ/zVAD.fmk treatment is RIP1-independent but relies on IFNβ-induced gene \nexpression of Z-DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) as shown by quantitative RT-PCR and \ngenetic knockdown experiments. Interestingly, we find that RIP3 is \nphosphorylated in response to compounds that trigger mitotic arrest, even in the \nabsence of IFNβ signaling and necroptosis induction. Together, the \nidentification of a novel combination treatment that triggers necroptosis has \nimplications for the development of molecular-targeted therapies to circumvent \napoptosis resistance and point to an underestimated role of cell cycle \nregulation in cell death signaling.",

            "TEXT": "BRD4 Levels Determine the Response of Human Lung Cancer Cells to BET Degraders \nThat Potently Induce Apoptosis through Suppression of Mcl-1.\n\nLung cancer consists of approximately 80% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and \n20% small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and remains the leading cause of \ncancer-related deaths worldwide despite advances in early diagnosis, targeted \ntherapy, and immunotherapy. Thus, novel therapies are still urgently needed. \nBromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins, primarily comprised of BRD2, BRD3, \nand BRD4 proteins, function as epigenetic readers and master transcription \ncoactivators and are now recognized cancer therapeutic targets. BET degraders \nsuch as ZBC260 and dBET represent a novel class of BET inhibitors that act by \ninducing BET degradation. The current study demonstrates the therapeutic \nefficacies of BET degraders, particularly ZBC260, against lung cancer, as well \nas understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying molecular markers \nthat determine cell sensitivity to BET degraders. A panel of NSCLC cell lines \npossessed similar response patterns to ZBC260 and dBET but different responses \nto BET inhibitor JQ-1. BRD levels, particularly BRD4, correlated positively with \nhigh sensitivity to BET degraders but not to JQ-1. BET degraders potently \ninduced apoptosis in sensitive NSCLC cells and were accompanied by reduction of \nMcl-1 and c-FLIP levels, which are critical for mediating induction of apoptosis \nand enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, ZBC260 exerted more \npotent activity than JQ-1 in vivo against the growth of NSCLC xenografts and \npatient-derived xenografts. These findings warrant future clinical validation of \nthe efficacy of BET degraders in NSCLC, particularly those with high levels of \nBRD proteins, especially BRD4.",

While \ninvestigating transcriptional regulation of the pluripotency transcription \nfactor Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), we observed that homozygous deletion of \ndistal enhancers caused a 17-fold decrease in Klf4 transcript but surprisingly \ndecreased protein levels by less than twofold, indicating that \nposttranscriptional control of KLF4 protein overrides transcriptional control. \nThe lack of sensitivity of KLF4 to transcription is due to high protein \nstability (half-life >24 h). This stability is context-dependent and is \ndisrupted during differentiation, as evidenced by a shift to a half-life of <2 \nh. KLF4 protein stability is maintained through interaction with other \npluripotency transcription factors (NANOG, SOX2, and STAT3) that together \nfacilitate association of KLF4 with RNA polymerase II. In addition, the KLF4 \nDNA-binding and transactivation domains are required for optimal KLF4 protein \nstability. Posttranslational modification of KLF4 destabilizes the protein as \ncells exit the pluripotent state, and mutations that prevent this \ndestabilization also prevent differentiation. These data indicate that the core \npluripotency transcription factors are integrated by posttranslational \nmechanisms to maintain the pluripotent state and identify mutations that \nincrease KLF4 protein stability while maintaining transcription factor function.",

Oncogenic KRAS, \na critical driver of pancreatic cancer, promotes metabolic reprogramming and \nupregulates NRF2, a master regulator of the antioxidant network.

NRF2 activation metabolically \nrewired and elevated pathways involved in glutamine metabolism. This curbed \nchemoresistance in KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancers. In addition, manipulating \nglutamine metabolism restrained the assembly of stress granules, an indicator of \nchemoresistance.

            "TEXT": "Immunomodulatory activity of IR700-labelled affibody targeting HER2.\n\nThere is an urgent need to develop therapeutic approaches that can increase the \nresponse rate to immuno-oncology agents. Photoimmunotherapy has recently been \nshown to generate anti-tumour immunological responses by releasing \ntumour-associated antigens from ablated tumour cell residues, thereby enhancing \nantigenicity and adjuvanticity. Here, we investigate the feasibility of a novel \nHER2-targeted affibody-based conjugate (ZHER2:2395-IR700) selectively to induce \ncancer cell death in vitro and in vivo. The studies in vitro confirmed the \nspecificity of ZHER2:2395-IR700 binding to HER2-positive cells and its ability \nto produce reactive oxygen species upon light irradiation. A conjugate \nconcentration- and light irradiation-dependent decrease in cell viability was \nalso demonstrated. Furthermore, light-activated ZHER2:2395-IR700 triggered all \nhallmarks of immunogenic cell death, as defined by the translocation of \ncalreticulin to the cell surface, and the secretion of ATP, HSP70/90 and HMGB1 \nfrom dying cancer cells into the medium. Irradiating a co-culture of immature \ndendritic cells (DCs) and cancer cells exposed to light-activated \nZHER2:2395-IR700 enhanced DC maturation, as indicated by augmented expression of \nCD86 and HLA-DR. In SKOV-3 xenografts, the ZHER2:2395-IR700-based phototherapy \ndelayed tumour growth and increased median overall survival. Collectively, our \nresults strongly suggest that ZHER2:2395-IR700 is a promising new therapeutic \nconjugate that has great potential to be applicable for photoimmunotherapy-based \nregimens.",

            "TEXT": "UBAP2L arginine methylation by PRMT1 modulates stress granule assembly.\n\nStress granules (SGs) are discrete assemblies of stalled messenger \nribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) that form when eukaryotic cells encounter \nenvironmental stress. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) mediate their condensation by \nrecruiting populations of mRNPs. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms \nunderlying the role of ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) in the \nregulation of SG dynamics remain elusive. Here, we show that UBAP2L is required \nfor both SG assembly and disassembly. UBAP2L overexpression nucleated SGs under \nstress-null conditions. The UBAP2L Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) motif was required for SG \ncompetence, and mediated the recruitment of SG components, including mRNPs, \nRBPs, and ribosomal subunits. The domain of unknown function (DUF) of \nUBAP2L-mediated interaction with ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein \n(G3BP)1/2, and its deletion caused the cytoplasmic-nuclear transport of UBAP2L \nand G3BP1/2, thereby compromising SG formation. The protein arginine \nmethyltransferase PRMT1 asymmetrically dimethylated UBAP2L by targeting the RGG \nmotif. Increased arginine methylation blocked, whereas its decrease enhanced \nUBAP2L interactions with SG components, ablating and promoting SG assembly, \nrespectively. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms by which \nUBAP2L regulates SG dynamics and RNA metabolism.",

Overexpression of \nCFP-Bcl-XL in Hela and A549 cells observably inhibited aspirin-induced ATP \ndepletion and almost completely inhibited the aspirin-induced cells bubbling, \nwhile pharmacological inhibition of endogenous Bcl-XL activity by ABT-737 \nremarkably promoted aspirin-induced ATP depletion and cells bubbling, suggesting \nthe key inhibitory role of Bcl-XL in aspirin-induced oncosis. Overexpression of \nBax/Bad significantly promoted aspirin-induced oncosis. In addition, cells \ncultured in a glucose-free medium with low ATP level exhibited higher percentage \nof bubbling cells than the cells cultured in a glucose medium with high ATP \nlevel under aspirin treatment, indicating the important role of ATP depletion in \naspirin-induced oncosis. Furthermore, caspase-3 was demonstrated to be not \ninvolved in aspirin-induced oncosis.

Here we show \nthat loss of REDD1, a stress-induced metabolic regulator, is sufficient to \nreprogram lipid metabolism and drive progression of RAS mutant cancers. Redd1 \ndeletion in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of KRAS-dependent \npancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas converts preneoplastic lesions into invasive \nand metastatic carcinomas. Metabolic profiling reveals that REDD1-deficient/RAS \nmutant cells exhibit enhanced uptake of lysophospholipids and lipid storage, \ncoupled to augmented fatty acid oxidation that sustains both ATP levels and \nROS-detoxifying NADPH. Mechanistically, REDD1 loss triggers HIF-dependent \nactivation of a lipid storage pathway involving PPARγ and the prometastatic \nfactor CD36. Correspondingly, decreased REDD1 expression and a signature of \nREDD1 loss predict poor outcomes selectively in RAS mutant but not RAS wild-type \nhuman lung and pancreas carcinomas. Collectively, our findings reveal the \nREDD1-mediated stress response as a novel tumor suppressor whose loss defines a \nRAS mutant tumor subset characterized by reprogramming of lipid metabolism, \ninvasive and metastatic progression, and poor prognosis. This work thus provides \nnew mechanistic and clinically relevant insights into the phenotypic \nheterogeneity and metabolic rewiring that underlies these common cancers.",

Here we demonstrated that PM exposure \ninactivated MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase), enhanced \nmacroautophagy/autophagy, and impaired lysosomal activity in HBE (human \nbronchial epithelial) cells and in mouse airway epithelium. Genetic or \npharmaceutical inhibition of MTOR significantly enhanced, while inhibition of \nautophagy attenuated, PM-induced IL6 expression in HBE cells. Consistently, \nclub-cell-specific deletion of Mtor aggravated, whereas loss of Atg5 in \nbronchial epithelium reduced, PM-induced airway inflammation. Interestingly, the \naugmented inflammatory responses caused by MTOR deficiency were markedly \nattenuated by blockage of downstream autophagy both in vitro and in vivo. \nMechanistically, the dysregulation of MTOR-autophagy signaling was partially \ndependent on activation of upstream TSC2, and interacted with the TLR4-MYD88 to \norchestrate the downstream NFKB activity and to regulate the production of \ninflammatory cytokines in airway epithelium. Moreover, inhibition of autophagy \nreduced the expression of EPS15 and the subsequent endocytosis of PM. Taken \ntogether, the present study provides a mechanistic explanation for how airway \nepithelium localized MTOR-autophagy axis regulates PM-induced airway injury, \nsuggesting that activation of MTOR and/or suppression of autophagy in local \nairway might be effective therapeutic strategies for PM-related airway \ndisorders.",

A rate-limiting step for GSH \nbiosynthesis is cystine uptake via a cystine/glutamate antiporter Xc-. Xc- is a \nsodium-independent antiporter passively driven by concentration gradients from \nextracellular cystine and intracellular glutamate across the cell membrane. \nIncreased uptake of cystine via Xc- in cancer cells increases the level of \nextracellular glutamate, which would subsequently restrain cystine uptake via \nXc-. Cancer cells must therefore evolve a mechanism to overcome this negative \nfeedback regulation. In this study, we report that glutamate transporters, in \nparticular SLC1A1, are tightly intertwined with cystine uptake and GSH \nbiosynthesis in lung cancer cells. Dysregulated SLC1A1, a sodium-dependent \nglutamate carrier, actively recycled extracellular glutamate into cells, which \nenhanced the efficiency of cystine uptake via Xc- and GSH biosynthesis as \nmeasured by stable isotope-assisted metabolomics. Conversely, depletion of \nglutamate transporter SLC1A1 increased extracellular glutamate, which inhibited \ncystine uptake, blocked GSH synthesis, and induced oxidative stress-mediated \ncell death or growth inhibition. Moreover, glutamate transporters were \nfrequently upregulated in tissue samples of patients with non-small cell lung \ncancer. Taken together, active uptake of glutamate via SLC1A1 propels cystine \nuptake via Xc- for GSH biosynthesis in lung tumorigenesis.",

Mechanistically, BAFF \nactivated NLRP3 inflammasomes by promoting the association of cIAP-TRAF2 with \ncomponents of NLRP3 inflammasomes, and by inducing Src activity-dependent ROS \nproduction and potassium ion efflux. B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation on the \nLyn signaling pathway inhibited BAFF-induced Src activities and attenuated \nBAFF-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These findings reveal an additional \nfunction of BAFF in B-cell homeostasis that is associated with BCR activities.",

Recent evidence has shown that hypoxia promotes local \nimmune suppression. Type I IFN supports cytotoxic T lymphocytes by stimulating \nthe maturation of dendritic cells and enhancing their capacity to process and \npresent antigens. However, little is known about the relationship between \nhypoxia and the type I IFN pathway, which comprises the sensing of \ndouble-stranded RNA and DNA (dsRNA/dsDNA) followed by IFNα/β secretion and \ntranscriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). In this study, we \ndetermined the effects of hypoxia on the type I IFN pathway in breast cancer and \nthe mechanisms involved. In cancer cell lines and xenograft models, mRNA and \nprotein expressions of the type I IFN pathway were downregulated under hypoxic \nconditions. This pathway was suppressed at each level of signaling, from the \ndsRNA sensors RIG-I and MDA5, the adaptor MAVS, transcription factors IRF3, \nIRF7, and STAT1, and several ISG including RIG-I, IRF7, STAT1, and ADAR-p150. \nImportantly, IFN secretion was reduced under hypoxic conditions. HIF1α- and \nHIF2α-mediated regulation of gene expression did not explain most of the \neffects. However, ATAC-seq data revealed in hypoxia that peaks with STAT1 and \nIRF3 motifs had decreased accessibility. Collectively, these results indicate \nthat hypoxia leads to an overall downregulation of the type I IFN pathway due to \nrepressed transcription and lower chromatin accessibility in an \nHIF1/2α-independent manner, which could contribute to immunosuppression in \nhypoxic tumors.",

Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) \nassay showed that ORI/Cet significantly increased the binding NF-κB family \nmember p65 with the promotor of BECN 1, and p65-mediated up-regulation of BECN 1 \ncaused by ORI/Cet is coupled to increased autophagy. On the other hand, we \ndemonstrated that either Beclin 1 SiRNA or autophagy inhibitors could increase \nORI/Cet induced-apoptosis, indicating that autophagy induced by combination of \nthe two agents plays a cytoprotective role. Interestingly, 48 h after the \ncombined treatment, autophagy began to decrease but apoptosis was significantly \nelevated.

In this study, we quantified intracellular water in \nstaurosporine-treated cells using a previously described optical microscopic \ntechnique that combines volume measurements with quantitative phase analysis. \nWater loss was observed in detached HeLa and in adherent MDCK but not in \nadherent HeLa cells. At the same time, adherent HeLa and adherent MDCK cells \nexhibited visually similar apoptotic morphology, including fragmentation and \nactivation of caspase-3. Morphological changes and caspase activation were \nprevented by chloride channel blockers DIDS and NPPB in both adherent and \nsuspended HeLa cells, while potassium channel blocker TEA was ineffective. We \nconclude that staurosporine-induced dehydration is not a universal cell response \nbut depends on the cell type and substrate attachment and can only be judged by \ndirect water measurements. The effects of potassium or chloride channel blockers \ndo not always correlate with the AVD.",

We recently discovered that \ncytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs), extruded from the nucleus of senescent \ncells, trigger the SASP through activation of the innate immunity cytosolic DNA \nsensing cGAS-STING pathway. However, the upstream signaling events that \ninstigate CCF formation remain unknown.

JNK links to 53BP1, a nuclear \nprotein that negatively regulates DNA double-strand break (DSB) end resection \nand CCF formation. Importantly, we show that low-dose HDAC inhibitors restore \nexpression of most nuclear-encoded mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation \ngenes, improve mitochondrial function, and suppress CCFs and the SASP in \nsenescent cells. In mouse models, HDAC inhibitors also suppress oxidative \nstress, CCF, inflammation, and tissue damage caused by senescence-inducing \nirradiation and/or acetaminophen-induced mitochondria dysfunction.

            "TEXT": "The antitumour drug ABTL0812 impairs neuroblastoma growth through endoplasmic \nreticulum stress-mediated autophagy and apoptosis.\n\nNeuroblastoma is the leading cause of cancer death in children aged 1 to 4 \nyears. Particularly, five-year overall survival for high-risk neuroblastoma is \nbelow 50% with no curative options when refractory or relapsed. Most of current \ntherapies target cell division and proliferation, thereby inducing DNA damage \nand programmed cell death. However, aggressive tumours often present alterations \nof these processes and are resistant to therapy. Therefore, exploring \nalternative pathways to induce tumour cell death will provide new therapeutic \nopportunities for these patients. In this study we aimed at testing the \ntherapeutic potential of ABTL0812, a novel anticancer drug that induces \ncytotoxic autophagy to eliminate cancer cells, which is currently in phase II \nclinical trials of adult tumours. Here, we show that ABTL0812 impaired the \nviability of clinical representative neuroblastoma cell lines regardless of \ngenetic alterations associated to bad prognosis and resistance to therapy. Oral \nadministration of ABTL0812 to mice bearing neuroblastoma xenografts impaired \ntumour growth. Furthermore, our findings revealed that, in neuroblastoma, \nABTL0812 induced cancer cell death via induction of endoplasmic reticulum \nstress, activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy and apoptosis. \nRemarkably, ABTL0812 potentiated the antitumour activity of chemotherapies and \ndifferentiating agents such as irinotecan and 13-cis-retinoic acid. In \nconclusion, ABTL0812 distinctive mechanism of action makes it standout to be \nused alone or in combination in high-risk neuroblastoma patients.",

The exact role of \nepigenetic modification in acute liver injury remains elusive. Here, we \ninvestigated the role of histone methyltransferase G9a in LPS- or APAP \noverdose-induced acute liver injury. Under D-galactosamine sensitization, \nliver-specific G9a-deficient mice (L-G9a-/-) exhibited 100% mortality after LPS \ninjection, while the control and L-G9a+/- littermates showed very mild \nmortality. Moreover, abrogation of hepatic G9a or inhibiting the \nmethyltransferase activity of G9a aggravated LPS-induced liver damage. \nSimilarly, under sublethal APAP overdose, L-G9a-/- mice displayed more severe \nliver injury. Mechanistically, ablation of G9a inhibited H3K9me1 levels at the \npromoters of Gstp1/2, two liver detoxifying enzymes, and consequently suppressed \ntheir transcription. Notably, treating L-G9a-/- mice with recombinant mouse \nGSTP1 reversed the LPS- or APAP overdose-induced liver damage. Taken together, \nwe identify a novel beneficial role of G9a-GSTP1 axis in protecting against \nacute liver injury.",

Although CD8+ \nantitumor cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are the preferred effectors of cancer \nimmunotherapy, CD4+ T-cell help is also required for an optimal antitumor immune \nresponse to occur. Hence, we investigated whether the pathogen-related CD4+ \nT-cell memory populations could be reengaged to support the CTLs, converting a \nweak primary antitumor immune response into a stronger secondary one. To this \nend, we used our PeptiCRAd technology that consists of an oncolytic adenovirus \ncoated with MHC-I-restricted tumor-specific peptides and developed it further by \nintroducing pathogen-specific MHC-II-restricted peptides. Mice preimmunized with \ntetanus vaccine were challenged with B16.OVA tumors and treated with the newly \ndeveloped hybrid TT-OVA-PeptiCRAd containing both tetanus toxoid- and \ntumor-specific peptides. Treatment with the hybrid PeptiCRAd significantly \nenhanced antitumor efficacy and induced TT-specific, CD40 ligand-expressing CD4+ \nT helper cells and maturation of antigen-presenting cells. Importantly, this \napproach could be extended to naturally occurring tumor peptides (both \ntumor-associated antigens and neoantigens), as well as to other pathogens beyond \ntetanus, highlighting the usefulness of this technique to take full advantage of \nCD4+ memory T-cell repertoires when designing immunotherapeutic treatment \nregimens.

Here, we examine the preclinical \nprofile of futibatinib (TAS-120; \n1-[(3S)-[4-amino-3-[(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl]-1H-pyrazolo[3, 4-d] \npyrimidin-1-yl]-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-propen-1-one), a structurally novel, \nirreversible FGFR1-4 inhibitor. Among a panel of 296 human kinases, futibatinib \nselectively inhibited FGFR1-4 with IC50 values of 1.4 to 3.7 nmol/L. Futibatinib \ncovalently bound the FGFR kinase domain, inhibiting FGFR phosphorylation and, in \nturn, downstream signaling in FGFR-deregulated tumor cell lines. Futibatinib \nexhibited potent, selective growth inhibition of several tumor cell lines \n(gastric, lung, multiple myeloma, bladder, endometrial, and breast) harboring \nvarious FGFR genomic aberrations. Oral administration of futibatinib led to \nsignificant dose-dependent tumor reduction in various FGFR-driven human tumor \nxenograft models, and tumor reduction was associated with sustained FGFR \ninhibition, which was proportional to the administered dose. The frequency of \nappearance of drug-resistant clones was lower with futibatinib than a reversible \nATP-competitive FGFR inhibitor, and futibatinib inhibited several drug-resistant \nFGFR2 mutants, including the FGFR2 V565I/L gatekeeper mutants, with greater \npotency than any reversible FGFR inhibitors tested (IC50, 1.3-50.6 nmol/L). \nThese results indicate that futibatinib is a novel orally available, potent, \nselective, and irreversible inhibitor of FGFR1-4 with a broad spectrum of \nantitumor activity in cell lines and xenograft models. These findings provide a \nstrong rationale for testing futibatinib in patients with tumors oncogenically \ndriven by FGFR genomic aberrations, with phase I to III trials ongoing. \nSIGNIFICANCE: Preclinical characterization of futibatinib, an irreversible \nFGFR1-4 inhibitor, demonstrates selective and potent antitumor activity against \nFGFR-deregulated cancer cell lines and xenograft models, supporting clinical \nevaluation in patients with FGFR-driven tumors.",

            "TEXT": "Enhancement of LIN28B-induced hematopoietic reprogramming by IGF2BP3.\n\nFetal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) hold promise to cure a \nwide array of hematological diseases, and we previously found a role for the \nRNA-binding protein (RBP) Lin28b in respecifying adult HSPCs to resemble their \nfetal counterparts. Here we show by single-cell RNA sequencing that Lin28b alone \nwas insufficient for complete reprogramming of gene expression from the adult \ntoward the fetal pattern. Using proteomics and in situ analyses, we found that \nLin28b (and its closely related paralog, Lin28a) directly interacted with \nIgf2bp3, another RBP, and their enforced co-expression in adult HSPCs \nreactivated fetal-like B-cell development in vivo more efficiently than either \nfactor alone. In B-cell progenitors, Lin28b and Igf2bp3 jointly stabilized \nthousands of mRNAs by binding at the same sites, including those of the B-cell \nregulators Pax5 and Arid3a as well as Igf2bp3 mRNA itself, forming an \nautoregulatory loop. Our results suggest that Lin28b and Igf2bp3 are at the \ncenter of a gene regulatory network that mediates the fetal-adult hematopoietic \nswitch. A method to efficiently generate induced fetal-like hematopoietic stem \ncells (ifHSCs) will facilitate basic studies of their biology and possibly pave \na path toward their clinical application.",

Upon IL-21 stimulation, AA-FLS \nexpressed elevated levels of autophagy-related 5 (Atg5), Beclin-1 and \nLC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate 3-II (LC3-II) through the utilization of \np62 and inhibition of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). BBR (15-45 µM) inhibited \nautophagy in AA-FLS cells mediated through PI3K/Akt signaling via suppressing \nautophagic elements, p62 sequestration and induction of CHOP in a dose-dependent \nmanner. Moreover, IL-21 promoted the uncontrolled proliferation of AA-FLS \nthrough induction of B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and diminished expression of \nBcl-2 associated X protein (BAX) via PI3K/Akt signaling. BBR inhibited the \nproliferation of AA-FLS via promoting apoptosis through increased expression of \nBAX and diminished Bcl-2 transcription factor levels. Furthermore, T cells \nstimulated with IL-21 induced CD4+ CD196+ Th17 cells proliferation through RORγt \nactivation mediated in a PI3K/Akt dependent manner. BBR inhibited the \nproliferation of Th17 cells through downregulation of RORγt in a \nconcentration-dependent manner. BBR also promoted the differentiation of CD4+ \nCD25+ Treg cells through induction of forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) activation via \naryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and upregulation of cytochrome P450 family 1, \nsubfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP1A1).

Little is also known about the roles of \napoptosis and autophagy as well as AhR and ERα signaling and HDACs in DIM \naction. We demonstrated for the first time the strong neuroprotective capacity \nof DIM in mouse primary hippocampal cell cultures exposed to ischemia at early \nand later stages of neuronal development. The protective effects of DIM were \nmediated via inhibition of ischemia-induced apoptosis and autophagy that was \naccompanied by a decrease in AhR/CYP1A1 signaling and an increase in HDAC \nactivity. DIM decreased the levels of pro-apoptotic factors, i.e., Fas, \nCaspase-3, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). DIM also reduced the \nprotein levels of autophagy-related Beclin-1 (BECN1) and microtubule-associated \nproteins 1A/1B light chain (LC3), partially reversed the ischemia-induced \ndecrease in Nucleoporin 62 (NUP62) and inhibited autophagosome formation. In \naddition, DIM completely reversed the ischemia-induced decrease in histone \ndeacetylase (HDAC) activity in hippocampal neurons. Although DIM inhibited \nAhR/CYP1A1 signaling, it did not influence the protein expression levels of ERα \nand ERα-regulated CYP19A1 which are known to be controlled by AhR. This study \ndemonstrated for the first time, that the neuroprotective action of \n3,3'-diindolylmethane against ischemia involves an inhibition of apoptosis and \nautophagy and depends on AhR/CYP1A1 signaling and HDAC activity, thus creating \nthe possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies that target neuronal \ndegeneration at specific molecular levels.",

Drosophila Chchd2, a homolog of the \nhuman disease-related genes CHCHD2 and CHCHD10, encodes a mitochondrial protein. \nIn this study, we found that loss of Chchd2 in flies resulted in progressive \ndegeneration of photoreceptor cells and reduced muscle integrity. In the flight \nmuscles of adult Chchd2 mutants, some mitochondria exhibited curling cristae and \na reduced number of cristae compared to those of controls. Overexpression of \nChchd2 carrying human disease-related point mutations failed to fully rescue the \nmitochondrial defects in Chchd2 mutants. In fat body cells, loss of Chchd2 \nresulted in fragmented mitochondria that could be partially rescued by Marf \noverexpression and enhanced by Opa1 RNAi. The expression level of Opa1 was \nreduced in Chchd2 mutants and increased when Chchd2 was overexpressed. The \nchaperone-like protein P32 co-immunoprecipitated with Chchd2 and YME1L, a \nprotease known to processes human OPA1. Moreover, the interaction between P32 \nand YME1L enhanced YME1L activity and promoted Opa1 degradation. Finally, Chchd2 \nstabilized Opa1 by competing with P32 for YME1L binding. We propose a model \nwhereby Chchd2 regulates mitochondrial morphology and tissue homeostasis by \nfine-tuning the levels of OPA1.",

This might be due to an \nincreased hepatocyte apoptosis induced after brain death (BD). In this work, we \nfound that the activity of PP2A-Akt pathway is significantly increased in \nclinical donor ex vivo hepatocytes after BD by iTRAQ protein quantification \nanalysis. The same results were confirmed in animal models. A time-dependent \npromotion of apoptosis was also found in DBD rabbit liver, as demonstrated by \nthe increased levels of cleaved Caspase 3 and the decreased of Bcl-2. To further \ninvestigate the roles of PP2A and Akt in regulating apoptosis of hepatocytes \nafter BD, we cultivated human liver cell line L02 with serum deprivation and \nhypoxia, to simulate the ischemic and hypoxic conditions of hepatocytes in DBD. \nIncreased apoptosis and decreased viability were observed during the time in \nthis model. Meanwhile PP2A activity and Akt activity were respectively increased \nand decreased. Notably, the proportion of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 \ndecreased, while other known targets of PP2A (p38, JNK and ERK) were not \naffected in terms of protein levels or phosphorylation. These results suggested \nthat PP2A is involved in apoptotic induction of hepatocytes after brain death by \nspecific suppression of Akt.

However, a caspase-independent mechanism initiated by \npoly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation has been reported to make \nmore contribution to cells death after ischemic stroke. In the present study, we \nestablished a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat model through middle \ncerebral artery occlusion following reperfusion to investigate the mechanisms of \nischemic tissue recovery following baicalein treatment. The data showed that \nbaicalein treatment at dose of 100 mg/kg for 7 days significantly inhibited the \nrelease of cytokines, activation of PARP-1, nuclear translocation of \napoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) \nin cerebral I/R rats, therefore decreased cerebral infarct volume and \nneurological scores. Then, we further investigated the signal transduction \nmechanisms of ischemic tissue protection by baicalein in vitro. Following oxygen \nand glucose deprivation (OGD) in SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial AIF was \ntranslocated into nucleus after 12 h. The co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed \nthat the interaction between AIF and MIF was activated by OGD and subsequently \nresulted in MIF nuclear translocation. Also, the baicalein inhibited apoptosis, \nreduced oxidative stress, protected mitochondrial function and restored \nmitochondrial membrane potential in OGD cells. The results obtained from both in \nvivo and in vitro study demonstrated the PARP-1/AIF pathway involved in \nmechanisms of baicalein to protect the cerebral tissues from ischemic injury.",

However, \nit is still unknown whether circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of \nendogenous noncoding RNAs, participate in the regulation of this progress. In \nthis study, we explored the expression profiles of circRNAs in three paired \nsamples of ESCC and identified cCNTNAP3, which is a circRNA that originates from \nthe CNTNAP3 gene transcript and is highly expressed in normal human esophageal \ntissue. However, we found that the cCNTNAP3 expression level was significantly \ndownregulated in ESCC tissues. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that \ncCNTNAP3 inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in p53 wild-type ESCC \ncells, but not in mutant cells. Mechanistically, we found that cCNTNAP3 promotes \nthe expression of p53 by sponging miR-513a-5p. Rescue assay confirmed that the \nsuppressive function of cCNTNAP3 was dependent on miR-513a-5p. We also observed \nthat p53/RBM25 participated in the formation of cCNTNAP3, which implied the \nexistence of a positive feedback loop between cCNTNAP3 and p53. Furthermore, the \ndownregulation of cCNTNAP3 was significantly correlated with later T stage and \nthus can serve as an independent risk factor for the overall survival of \npatients with p53 wild-type ESCC. In conclusion, the cCNTNAP3-TP53 positive \nfeedback loop may provide a potential target for the management of ESCC, which \nalso reveals the important role of circRNAs in the regulation of p53.",

Using circRNA sequencing, we identified 169 differentially expressed \ncircRNA in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells compared with nontumor \nhuman pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Among them, circFOXK2 was validated \nwith significant upregulation in PDAC cells and 63% of primary tumors (53 of \n84). circFOXK2 promoted cell growth, migration, and invasion and was involved in \ncell-cycle progression and apoptosis. circFOXK2 contained multiple miRNA binding \nsites, functioning as a sponge for miR-942, which in turn promoted expression of \nANK1, GDNF, and PAX6. A novel and highly specific circRNA-pulldown followed by \nmass spectrometry analysis identified 94 circFOXK2-interacting proteins, which \nwere involved in cell adhesion, mRNA splicing, and structural molecule activity. \nOf these, circFOKX2 interactions with YBX1 and hnRNPK enhanced expression of \noncogenes NUF2 and PDXK. Knockdown of circFOXK2 reduced binding of YBX1 and \nhnRNPK to NUF2 and PDXK, in turn decreasing their expression.

However, the underlying \nmechanism linking the two pathways remains elusive. Here, we show that SIRT1 \nfunctions as a modifier of CHK2 in cell cycle control. Specifically, SIRT1 \ninteracts with CHK2 and deacetylates it at lysine 520 residue, which suppresses \nCHK2 phosphorylation, dimerization, and thus activation. SIRT1 depletion induces \nCHK2 hyperactivation-mediated cell cycle arrest and subsequent cell death. In \nvivo, genetic deletion of Chk2 rescues the neonatal lethality of Sirt1-/- mice, \nconsistent with the role of SIRT1 in preventing CHK2 hyperactivation. Together, \nthese results suggest that CHK2 mediates the function of SIRT1 in cell cycle \nprogression, and may provide new insights into modulating cellular homeostasis \nand maintaining genomic integrity in the prevention of aging and cancer.",

In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and \nNMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that \nSRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on \nsequence-specific RNA binding and splicing.

            "TEXT": "The extracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio modulates the sensitivity to \noxidative stress-induced apoptosis via the cytosolic NADH/NAD(+) redox state.\n\nThe advantages of the Warburg effect on tumor growth and progression are well \nrecognized. However, the relevance of the Warburg effect for the inherent \nresistance to apoptosis of cancer cells has received much less attention. Here, \nwe show here that the Warburg effect modulates the extracellular \nlactate-to-pyruvate ratio, which profoundly regulates the sensitivity towards \napoptosis induced by oxidative stress in several cell lines. To induce oxidative \nstress, we used the rapid apoptosis inducer Raptinal. We observed that medium \nconditioned by HepG2 cells has a high lactate-to-pyruvate ratio and confers \nresistance to Raptinal-induced apoptosis. In addition, imposing a high \nextracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio in media reduces the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ \nredox state and protects against Raptinal-induced apoptosis. Conversely, a low \nextracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio oxidizes the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ redox \nstate and sensitizes HepG2 cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. \nMechanistically, a high extracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio decreases the \nactivation of JNK and Bax under oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting the \nintrinsic apoptotic pathway. Our observations demonstrate that the Warburg \neffect of cancer cells generates an anti-apoptotic extracellular environment by \nelevating the extracellular lactate-to-pyruvate ratio which desensitizes cancer \ncells towards apoptotic insults. Consequently, our study suggests that the \nWarburg effect can be targeted to reverse the lactate-to-pyruvate ratios in the \ntumor microenvironment and thereby re-sensitize cancer cells to oxidative \nstress-inducing therapies.",

            "TEXT": "USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN/parkin and antagonizes its role in mitophagy.\n\nPRKN/parkin activation through phosphorylation of its ubiquitin and \nubiquitin-like domain by PINK1 is critical in mitophagy induction for \neliminating the damaged mitochondria. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) \nfunctionally reversing PRKN ubiquitination are critical in controlling the \nmagnitude of PRKN-mediated mitophagy process. However, potential DUBs that \ndirectly target PRKN and antagonize its pro-mitophagy effect remains to be \nidentified and characterized. Here, we demonstrated that USP33/VDU1 is localized \nat the outer membrane of mitochondria and serves as a PRKN DUB through their \ninteraction. Cellular and in vitro assays illustrated that USP33 deubiquitinates \nPRKN in a DUB activity-dependent manner. USP33 prefers to remove K6, K11, K48 \nand K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates from PRKN, and deubiquitinates PRKN mainly \nat Lys435. Mutation of this site leads to a significantly decreased level of \nK63-, but not K48-linked PRKN ubiquitination. USP33 deficiency enhanced both \nK48- and K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination, but only K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination \nwas significantly increased under mitochondrial depolarization. Further, USP33 \nknockdown increased both PRKN protein stabilization and its translocation to \ndepolarized mitochondria leading to the enhancement of mitophagy. Moreover, \nUSP33 silencing protects SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells from the neurotoxin \nMPTP-induced apoptotic cell death. Our findings convincingly demonstrate that \nUSP33 is a novel PRKN deubiquitinase antagonizing its regulatory roles in \nmitophagy and SH-SY5Y neuron-like cell survival. Thus, USP33 inhibition may \nrepresents an attractive new therapeutic strategy for PD patients.",

            "TEXT": "Cytokine regulation of apoptosis-induced apoptosis and apoptosis-induced cell \nproliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells.\n\nVascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the main structural cell of blood \nvessels, and VSMC apoptosis occurs in vascular disease, after injury, and in \nvessel remodeling during development. Although VSMC apoptosis is viewed as \nsilent, recent studies show that apoptotic cells can promote apoptosis-induced \ncompensatory proliferation (AICP), apoptosis-induced apoptosis (AIA), and \nmigration of both local somatic and infiltrating inflammatory cells. However, \nthe effects of VSMC apoptosis on adjacent VSMCs, and their underlying signaling \nand mechanisms are unknown. We examined the consequences of VSMC apoptosis after \nactivating extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways. VSMCs undergoing apoptosis \nthrough Fas/CD95 or the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine transcriptionally \nactivated interleukin 6 (IL-6) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating \nfactor (GM-CSF), leading to their secretion. Apoptosis induced activation of \np38MAPK, JNK, and Akt, but neither p38 and JNK activation nor IL-6 or GM-CSF \ninduction required caspase cleavage. IL-6 induction depended upon p38 activity, \nwhile Fas-induced GM-CSF expression required p38 and JNK. Conditioned media from \napoptotic VSMCs induced VSMC apoptosis in vitro, and IL-6 and GM-CSF acted as \npro-survival factors for AIA. VSMC apoptosis was studied in vivo using SM22α-DTR \nmice that express the diphtheria toxin receptor in VSMCs only. DT administration \ninduced VSMC apoptosis and VSMC proliferation, and also signficantly induced \nIL-6 and GM-CSF. We conclude that VSMC apoptosis activates multiple \ncaspase-independent intracellular signaling cascades, leading to release of \nsoluble cytokines involved in regulation of both cell proliferation and \napoptosis. VSMC AICP may ameliorate while AIA may amplify the effects of \npro-apoptotic stimuli in vessel remodeling and disease.",

Metastatic cancer spread is \nresponsible for most cancer deaths but the cellular changes that enable cancer \ncells to leave the primary tumor and establish inoperable and lethal metastases \nremain poorly understood. To uncover genes that are specifically required to \nsustain metastasis survival or growth, we performed a genome-scale pooled \nlentiviral-shRNA library screen in cells that represent non-metastatic and \nmetastatic states of lung adenocarcinoma. Mitochondrial ribosome and \nmitochondria-associated genes were identified as top gene sets associated with \nmetastasis-specific lethality. Metastasis-derived cell lines in vitro and \nmetastases analyzed ex vivo from an autochthonous lung cancer mouse model had \nlower mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced mitochondrial functionality \nthan non-metastatic primary tumors. Electron microscopy of metastases uncovered \nirregular mitochondria with bridging and loss of normal membrane structure. \nConsistent with these findings, compounds that inhibit mitochondrial translation \nor replication had a greater effect on the growth of metastasis-derived cells. \nFinally, mice with established tumors developed fewer metastases upon treatment \nwith phenformin in vivo. These results suggest that the metastatic cell state in \nlung adenocarcinoma is associated with a specifically altered mitochondrial \nfunctionality that can be therapeutically exploited.",

Here, we found DDX3 expression was upregulated in both \ncisplatin-resistant OSCC lines and chemoresistant tumors when compared with \ntheir respective sensitive counterparts. In a patient-derived cell xenograft \nmodel of chemoresistant OSCC, ketorolac salt restores cisplatin-mediated cell \ndeath and facilitates a significant reduction of tumor burdens.

Bazedoxifene (BZA), a third-generation \nselective estrogen receptor modulator, was discovered by multiple ligand \nsimultaneous docking and drug repositioning approaches to have a novel function \nas an IL-6/GP130 target inhibitor. Thus, we speculated that in colon cancer, the \nanti-tumor efficacy of 5-FU might be increased in combination with IL-6/GP130 \ninhibitors. CCK8 assay and colony formation assay were used to detect the cell \nproliferation and colony formation. We measured the IC50 value of 5-FU alone and \nin combination with BZA by cell viability inhibition. Cell migration and \ninvasion ability were tested by scratch migration assays and transwell invasion \nassays. Flow cytometric analysis for cell apoptosis and cell cycle. Quantitative \nreal-time PCR was used to detect Bad, Bcl-2 and Ki-67 mRNA expression and \nwestern blotting (WB) assay analyzed protein expression of Bad/Bcl-2 signaling \npathway. Further mechanism study, WB analysis detected the key proteins level in \nIL-6/GP130 targets and JAK/STAT3, Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling \npathway. A colon cancer xenograft model was used to further confirm the efficacy \nof 5-FU and BZA in vivo. The GP130, P-STAT3, P-AKT, and P-ERK expression levels \nwere detected by immunohistochemistry in the xenograft tumor. BZA markedly \npotentiates the anti-tumor function of 5-FU in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, \n5-FU activation is reduced following exogenous IL-6 treatment in cells. Further \nmechanistic studies determined that BZA treatment enhanced 5-FU anti-tumor \nactivation by inhibiting the IL-6/GP130 signaling pathway and the \nphosphorylation status of the downstream effectors AKT, ERK and STAT3. In \ncontrast, IL-6 can attenuate 5-FU function via activating IL-6R/GP130 signaling \nand the P-AKT, P-ERK and P-STAT3 levels. This study firstly verifies that \ntargeting IL-6/GP130 signaling can increase the anti-tumor function of 5-FU; in \naddition, this strategy can sensitize cancer cell drug sensitivity, implying \nthat blocking IL-6/GP130 targets can reverse chemoresistance. Therefore, \ncombining 5-FU and IL-6/GP130 target inhibitors may be a promising approach for \ncancer treatment.",

            "TEXT": "Infiltrating Mast Cell-Mediated Stimulation of Estrogen Receptor Activity in \nBreast Cancer Cells Promotes the Luminal Phenotype.\n\nTumor growth and development is determined by both cancer cell-autonomous and \nmicroenvironmental mechanisms, including the contribution of infiltrating immune \ncells. Because the role of mast cells (MC) in this process is poorly \ncharacterized and even controversial, we investigated their part in breast \ncancer. Crossing C57BL/6 MMTV-PyMT mice, which spontaneously develop mammary \ncarcinomas, with MC-deficient C57BL/6-KitW-sh/W-sh (Wsh) mice, showed that MCs \npromote tumor growth and prevent the development of basal CK5-positive areas in \nfavor of a luminal gene program. When cocultured with breast cancer cells in \nvitro, MCs hindered activation of cMET, a master regulator of the basal program, \nand simultaneously promoted expression and activation of estrogen receptor \n(ESR1/ER) and its target genes (PGR, KRT8/CK8, BCL2), which are all luminal \nmarkers. Moreover, MCs reduced ERBB2/HER2 levels, whose inhibition further \nincreased ESR1 expression. In vivo and in silico analysis of patients with \nbreast cancer revealed a direct correlation between MC density and ESR1 \nexpression. In mice engrafted with HER2-positive breast cancer tumors, \ncoinjection of MCs increased tumor engraftment and outgrowth, supporting the \nlink between MCs and increased risk of relapse in patients with breast cancer. \nTogether, our findings support the notion that MCs influence the phenotype of \nbreast cancer cells by stimulating a luminal phenotype and ultimately modifying \nthe outcome of the disease.",

In this \nstudy, we sought to identify the best adjunct targets to kill myeloma cells \nresistant to conventional therapies using deep profiling by mass cytometry \n(CyTOF).

Among \nthese parameters, increased amounts of phosphorylated cAMP response \nelement-binding protein (CREB) and the pro-survival protein, MCL-1, were \ndefining features of cells surviving drug treatment. Importantly, the RFM \nprediction that the combination of an MCL-1 inhibitor with dexamethasone would \nelicit potent, synergistic killing of myeloma cells was validated in other cell \nlines, in vivo preclinical models and primary myeloma samples from patients. \nFurthermore, CyTOF analysis of patient bone marrow cells clearly identified \nmyeloma cells and their key cell survival features.

Recent advance revealed that the sensitivity to \nferroptosis is tightly linked to numerous biological processes, including \nmetabolism of amino acid and the biosynthesis of glutathione. Here, by using a \nhigh-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen in HepG2 hepatocellular \ncarcinoma cells to search for metabolic proteins inhibiting ferroptosis, we \nidentified a branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 2 (BCAT2) as a novel \nsuppressor of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, ferroptosis inducers (erastin, \nsorafenib, and sulfasalazine) activated AMPK/SREBP1 signaling pathway through \niron-dependent ferritinophagy, which in turn inhibited BCAT2 transcription. We \nfurther confirmed that BCAT2 as the key enzyme mediating the metabolism of \nsulfur amino acid, regulated intracellular glutamate level, whose activation by \nectopic expression specifically antagonize system Xc- inhibition and protected \nliver and pancreatic cancer cells from ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. On the \ncontrary, direct inhibition of BCAT2 by RNA interference, or indirect inhibition \nby blocking system Xc- activity, triggers ferroptosis. Finally, our results \ndemonstrate the synergistic effect of sorafenib and sulfasalazine in \ndownregulating BCAT2 expression and dictating ferroptotic death, where BCAT2 can \nalso be used to predict the responsiveness of cancer cells to \nferroptosis-inducing therapies. Collectively, these findings identify a novel \nrole of BCAT2 in ferroptosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for \novercoming sorafenib resistance.",

            "TEXT": "ALS-FTLD-linked mutations of SQSTM1/p62 disrupt selective autophagy and \nNFE2L2/NRF2 anti-oxidative stress pathway.\n\nMacroautophagy (autophagy) is a key catabolic pathway for the maintenance of \nproteostasis through constant digestion of selective cargoes. The selectivity of \nautophagy is mediated by autophagy receptors that recognize and recruit cargoes \nto autophagosomes. SQSTM1/p62 is a prototype autophagy receptor, which is \ncommonly found in protein aggregates associated with major neurodegenerative \ndiseases. While accumulation of SQSTM1 implicates a disturbance of selective \nautophagy pathway, the pathogenic mechanism that contributes to impaired \nautophagy degradation remains poorly characterized. Herein we show that \namyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration \n(FTLD)-linked mutations of TBK1 and SQSTM1 disrupt selective autophagy and cause \nneurotoxicity. Our data demonstrates that proteotoxic stress activates \nserine/threonine kinase TBK1, which coordinates with autophagy kinase ULK1 to \npromote concerted phosphorylation of autophagy receptor SQSTM1 at the UBA domain \nand activation of selective autophagy. In contrast, ALS-FTLD-linked mutations of \nTBK1 or SQSTM1 reduce SQSTM1 phosphorylation and compromise ubiquitinated cargo \nbinding and clearance. Moreover, disease mutation SQSTM1G427R abolishes \nphosphorylation of Ser351 and impairs KEAP1-SQSTM1 interaction, thus diminishing \nNFE2L2/Nrf2-targeted gene expression and increasing TARDBP/TDP-43 associated \nstress granule formation under oxidative stress. Furthermore, expression of \nSQSTM1G427R in neurons impairs dendrite morphology and KEAP1-NFE2L2 signaling. \nTherefore, our results reveal a mechanism whereby pathogenic SQSTM1 mutants \ninhibit selective autophagy and disrupt NFE2L2 anti-oxidative stress response \nunderlying the neurotoxicity in ALS-FTLD.",

However, the therapeutic potential of FINs in prostate cancer in \npreclinical settings has not been explored.

Either knockdown of the SUMO-activating \nenzyme SAE2 or pharmacologic inhibition of SUMOylation resulted in decreased \nlevels of EZH2 mRNA and protein as well as reduced H3K27me3 levels.

Inhibition of SUMOylation not only resulted in \nreduced EZH2 mRNA and protein levels but also increased expression of genes \nsilenced by EZH2, such as E-cadherin, which suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal \ntransition and metastasis. In more than 6,500 patient tumor samples across \ndifferent cancer types, expression of UBA2 and EZH2 was positively correlated. \nTaken together, our findings suggest that inhibition of SUMOylation may serve as \na potential strategy to address EZH2 overexpression and improve current cancer \ntherapeutic approaches.",

Core lesions, focal areas of \nmitochondria depletion in skeletal muscle fibers, are the most common \nhistopathological lesion. SEPN1-RM underlying mechanisms and the precise role of \nSEPN1 in muscle remained incompletely understood, hindering the development of \nbiomarkers and therapies for this untreatable disease. To investigate the \npathophysiological pathways in SEPN1-RM, we performed metabolic studies, calcium \nand ATP measurements, super-resolution and electron microscopy on in vivo and in \nvitro models of SEPN1 deficiency as well as muscle biopsies from SEPN1-RM \npatients. Mouse models of SEPN1 deficiency showed marked alterations in \nmitochondrial physiology and energy metabolism, suggesting that SEPN1 controls \nmitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, we found that SEPN1 was enriched at the \nmitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), and was needed for calcium transients \nbetween ER and mitochondria, as well as for the integrity of ER-mitochondria \ncontacts. Consistently, loss of SEPN1 in patients was associated with \nalterations in body composition which correlated with the severity of muscle \nweakness, and with impaired ER-mitochondria contacts and low ATP levels. Our \nresults indicate a role of SEPN1 as a novel MAM protein involved in \nmitochondrial bioenergetics. They also identify a systemic bioenergetic \ncomponent in SEPN1-RM and establish mitochondria as a novel therapeutic target. \nThis role of SEPN1 contributes to explain the fatigue and core lesions in \nskeletal muscle as well as the body composition abnormalities identified as part \nof the SEPN1-RM phenotype. Finally, these results point out to an unrecognized \ninterplay between mitochondrial bioenergetics and ER homeostasis in skeletal \nmuscle. They could therefore pave the way to the identification of biomarkers \nand therapeutic drugs for SEPN1-RM and for other disorders in which muscle \nER-mitochondria cross-talk are impaired.",

Herein, we investigated the role of Myocilin (Myoc), a skeletal \nmuscle hypertrophy-promoting protein that we showed is downregulated in multiple \nmouse models of cancer cachexia. Loss of Myoc alone was sufficient to induce \nphenotypes identified in mouse models of cancer cachexia, including muscle fiber \natrophy, sarcolemmal fragility, and impaired muscle regeneration. By 18 months \nof age, mice deficient in Myoc showed significant skeletal muscle remodeling, \ncharacterized by increased fat and collagen deposition compared with wild-type \nmice, thus also supporting Myoc as a regulator of muscle quality. In cancer \ncachexia models, maintaining skeletal muscle expression of Myoc significantly \nattenuated muscle loss, while mice lacking Myoc showed enhanced muscle wasting. \nFurthermore, we identified the myocyte enhancer factor 2 C (MEF2C) transcription \nfactor as a key upstream activator of Myoc whose gain of function significantly \ndeterred cancer-induced muscle wasting and dysfunction in a preclinical model of \npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Finally, compared with noncancer \ncontrol patients, MYOC was significantly reduced in skeletal muscle of patients \nwith PDAC defined as cachectic and correlated with MEF2c. These data therefore \nidentify disruptions in MEF2c-dependent transcription of Myoc as a novel \nmechanism of cancer-associated muscle wasting that is similarly disrupted in \nmuscle of patients with cachectic cancer.",

For instance, a considerable challenge for the treatment of HCC is \nsorafenib resistance. The aberrant glucose metabolism in cancer cells aerobic \nglycolysis is associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. \nDrug-resistance cells and tumors were exposed to sorafenib to establish \nsorafenib-resistance cell lines and tumors. Western blotting and real-time PCR \nor IHC staining were used to analyze the level of CLCF1 in the sorafenib \nresistance cell lines or tumors. The aerobic glycolysis was analyzed by ECAR \nassay. The mechanism mediating the high expression of CLCF1 in \nsorafenib-resistant cells and its relationships with miR-130-5p was determined \nby bioinformatic analysis, dual luciferase reporter assays, real-time PCR, and \nwestern blotting. The in vivo effect was evaluated by xenografted with nude \nmice. The relation of CLCF1 and miR-30a-5p was determined in patients' samples. \nIn this study, we report the relationship between sorafenib resistance and \nincreased glycolysis in HCC cells. We also show the vital role of CLCF1 in \npromoting glycolysis by activating PI3K/AKT signaling and its downstream genes, \nthus participating in glycolysis in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Furthermore, \nwe also show that miR-30a-5p directly targets CLCF1 and that sorafenib-mediated \nsuppression of miR-30a-5p results in the upregulation of CLCF1 in HCC cells \nresistant to sorafenib. We also found that when a cholesterol modified \nagomiR-30a-5p was delivered systemically to mice harboring sorafenib-resistant \nHCC tumors, tumor growth decreased significantly. There is an uncharacterized \nmechanism of biochemical resistance to hormone therapies orchestrated by the \nmiR-30a-5p/CLCF1 axis to mediate sorafenib resistance and aerobic glycolysis in \nHCC. Therefore, this study indicates that targeting the miR-30a-5p/CLCF1 axis \nmay hold promise for therapeutic intervention in HCC sorafenib resistance \npatients.",

Here, we demonstrate that high-fat diet \n(HFD)-induced obesity impairs CD8+ T cell function in the murine TME, \naccelerating tumor growth. We generate a single-cell resolution atlas of \ncellular metabolism in the TME, detailing how it changes with diet-induced \nobesity. We find that tumor and CD8+ T cells display distinct metabolic \nadaptations to obesity. Tumor cells increase fat uptake with HFD, whereas \ntumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells do not. These differential adaptations lead to \naltered fatty acid partitioning in HFD tumors, impairing CD8+ T cell \ninfiltration and function. Blocking metabolic reprogramming by tumor cells in \nobese mice improves anti-tumor immunity. Analysis of human cancers reveals \nsimilar transcriptional changes in CD8+ T cell markers, suggesting interventions \nthat exploit metabolism to improve cancer immunotherapy.",

Here we analyzed the apoptosis-inducing effect of high dose \n(10-6 M) in vitro dexamethasone (DX) treatment in mouse thymic- and splenic \nTregs and CD4+ T cells. Activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic \npathways started after 2 h of DX treatment in CD4 SP thymocytes and was \n3 × higher than in CD4+ splenocytes, while in Treg cells, weak activation of the \nextrinsic apoptotic pathway started only after 3 h. We also investigated the \nexpression of 21 apoptosis-related molecules using a protein array and found \nhigher level of both pro-and anti-apoptotic molecules in Tregs compared to CD4+ \nT cells. 4 h in vitro DX treatment induced upregulation of most \napoptosis-related molecules both in Tregs and CD4+ T cells, except for the \ndecrease of Bcl-2 expression in CD4+ T cells. We found high basal cytosolic Ca2+ \nlevels in untreated Treg cells, which further increased after DX treatment, \nwhile the specific TCR-induced Ca2+ signal was lower in Tregs than in CD4+ T \ncells. Our results suggest that in the background of the relative apoptosis \nresistance of Treg cells to GCs might be their high basal cytosolic Ca2+ level \nand upregulated Bcl-2 expression. In contrast, downregulation of Bcl-2 \nexpression in CD4+ T cells can explain their higher, DX-induced apoptosis \nsensitivity.",

AMBRA1 is a mitophagy receptor for the selective removal of \ndamaged mitochondria in mammalian cells. A critical unresolved issue is how \nAMBRA1-mediated mitophagy is controlled in response to cellular stress. Here, we \ninvestigated the role of BCL2-family proteins on AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy and \nshowed that MCL1 delays AMBRA1-dependent mitophagy. Indeed, MCL1 overexpression \nis sufficient to inhibit recruitment to mitochondria of the E3 Ubiquitin ligase \nHUWE1, a crucial dynamic partner of AMBRA1, upon AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy \ninduction. In addition, we found that during mitophagy induced by AMBRA1, MCL1 \nlevels decreased but were sustained by inhibition of the GSK-3β kinase, which \ndelayed AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Also, we showed that MCL1 was phosphorylated \nby GSK-3β at a conserved GSK-3 phosphorylation site (S159) during \nAMBRA1-mediated mitophagy and that this event was accompanied by HUWE1-dependent \nMCL1 degradation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that MCL1 stability is \nregulated by the kinase GSK-3β and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 in regulating \nAMBRA1-mediated mitophagy. Our work thus defines MCL1 as an upstream \nstress-sensitive protein, functional in AMBRA1-mediated mitophagy.",

Mutations in LZTR1 have been identified in \nglioblastoma, schwannomatosis, and Noonan syndrome. However, the functional role \nof LZTR1 in carcinogenesis or human development is not fully understood. Here, \nwe demonstrate that LZTR1 facilitates the polyubiquitination and degradation of \nRAS via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to the inhibition of the \nRAS/MAPK signaling. The polyubiquitination and degradation of RAS was also \nobserved in cells expressing MRAS, HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS as well as oncogenic RAS \nmutants and inhibited the activation of ERK1/2 and cell growth. In vivo \nubiquitination assays showed that MRAS-K127 and HRAS-K170 were ubiquitinated by \nLZTR1 and that the polyubiquitinated-chains contained mainly Ub-K48, K63, and \nK33-linked chains, suggesting its possible involvement in autophagy. \nImmunoprecipitation analyses showed the interaction of LZTR1 and RAS-GTPases \nwith autophagy-related proteins, including LC3B and SQSTM1/p62. Co-expression of \nLZTR1 and RAS increased the expression of lipidated form of LC3B. However, \nlong-term treatment with chloroquine had little effect on RAS protein levels, \nsuggesting that the contribution of autophagy to LZTR1-mediated RAS degradation \nis minimal. Taken together, these results show that LZTR1 functions as a \"RAS \nkiller protein\" mainly via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regardless of the \ntype of RAS GTPase, controlling downstream signal transduction. Our results also \nsuggest a possible association of LZTR1 and RAS-GTPases with the autophagy. \nThese findings provide clues for the elucidation of the mechanisms of RAS \ndegradation and regulation of the RAS/MAPK signaling cascade.",

Strikingly, \nreintroduction of BRCA1 or 53BP1 depletion restored HR and rescued the ability \nof cells to maintain RNF168 and ub-H2AX overexpression. Thus, downregulation of \nRNF168 protein expression is a mechanism for providing BRCA1-null cancer cell \nlines with a residual level of HR that is essential for viability. Overall, our \nwork identifies loss of RNF168 ubiquitin signaling as a proteomic alteration \nthat supports BRCA1-mutant carcinogenesis. We propose that restoring \nRNF168-ub-H2AX signaling, potentially through inhibition of deubiquitinases, \ncould represent a new therapeutic approach.",

            "TEXT": "Cancer Cell-Derived Matrisome Proteins Promote Metastasis in Pancreatic Ductal \nAdenocarcinoma.\n\nThe prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains poor despite \ndecades of effort. The abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) in PDAC comprises a \nmajor fraction of the tumor mass and plays various roles in promoting resistance \nto therapies. However, nonselective depletion of ECM has led to poor patient \noutcomes. Consistent with that observation, we previously showed that individual \nmatrisome proteins derived from stromal cells correlate with either long or \nshort patient survival. In marked contrast, those derived from cancer cells \ncorrelate strongly with poor survival. Here, we studied three cancer \ncell-derived matrisome proteins that are significantly overrepresented during \nPDAC progression, AGRN (agrin), SERPINB5 (serine protease inhibitor B5), and \nCSTB (cystatin B). Using both overexpression and knockdown experiments, we \ndemonstrate that all three are promoters of PDAC metastasis. Furthermore, these \nproteins operate at different metastatic steps. AGRN promoted \nepithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in primary tumors, whereas SERPINB5 and \nCSTB enhanced late steps in the metastatic cascade by elevating invadopodia \nformation and in vivo extravasation. All three genes were associated with a poor \nprognosis in human patients and high levels of SERPINB5, secreted by cancer \ncells and deposited in the ECM, correlated with poor patient prognosis. This \nstudy provides strong evidence that cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins can \nbe causal in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis and lead to poor patient \nsurvival. Therefore, compared with the bulk matrix, mostly made by stromal \ncells, precise interventions targeting cancer cell-derived matrisome proteins, \nsuch as AGRN, SERPINB5, and CSTB, may represent preferred potential therapeutic \ntargets. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insights into the biological roles of \ncancer cell-derived matrisome proteins in PDAC and supports the notion that \nthese proteins are protumorigenic and better therapeutic targets.",

For the treatment of progressive AS, arsenic trioxide \n(ATO) has been used to coat vascular stents. However, the effect of ATO on \nautophagy of macrophages is still unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study \nwere to characterize the effects and the mechanism of actions of ATO on \nautophagy in macrophages. Our results showed that ATO-induced activation of \nautophagy was an earlier event than ATO-induced inhibition of the expression of \napoptosis markers in macrophages and foam cells. Nuclear transcription factor EB \n(TFEB) prevents atherosclerosis by activating macrophage autophagy and promoting \nlysosomal biogenesis. Here, we report that ATO triggered the nuclear \ntranslocation of TFEB, which in turn promoted autophagy and \nautophagosome-lysosome fusion. Both the latter events were prevented by TFEB \nknockdown. Moreover, ATO decreased the p-AKT and p-mTOR in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR \nsignaling pathway, thus inducing autophagy. Correspondingly, treatment with the \nautophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) abolished the autophagy-inducing \neffects of ATO. Meanwhile, PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) and mTOR inhibitor \n(rapamycin) cooperated with ATO to induce autophagy. Furthermore, reactive \noxygen species (ROS) were generated in macrophages after treatment with ATO. The \nROS scavenger N-acetyl-1-cysteine (NAC) abolished ATO-induced nuclear \ntranslocation of TFEB, as well as changes in key molecules of the AKT/mTOR \nsignaling pathway and downstream autophagy. More importantly, ATO promoted \nautophagy in the aorta of ApoE-/- mice and reduced atherosclerotic lesions in \nearly AS, which were reversed by 3-MA treatment. In summary, our data indicated \nthat ATO promoted ROS induction, which resulted in nuclear translocation of TFEB \nand inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These actions ultimately promoted \nmacrophage autophagy and reduced atherosclerotic lesions at early stages. These \nfindings may provide a new perspective for the clinical treatment of early-stage \natherosclerosis and should be further studied.",

            "TEXT": "Age-dependent autophagy induction after injury promotes axon regeneration by \nlimiting NOTCH.\n\nMacroautophagy/autophagy is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis \nthrough the degradation of organelles and proteins. It also has a prominent role \nin modulating aging. However, the role of autophagy in the neuronal response to \naxon injury and axon regeneration, particularly in the context of aging, remains \nlargely unknown. Our candidate genetic screen for axon regeneration regulators \nhas identified genes in the autophagy pathway. Using a reporter that monitors \nautophagosomes and autolysosomes, we were able to monitor the dynamics of \nautophagy during axon regeneration. In response to axon injury, there was a \nsignificant increase in the number of autophagic vesicles. Injury-triggered \nautophagy activation and axon regeneration capacity undergo an age-dependent \ndecline, and autophagy-activating agents partially rescued these declines. We \nfound that DLK-1 was both required and sufficient for injury-induced autophagy \nactivation. Autophagic vesicles co-localized with the NOTCH4 ortholog, LIN-12 \nreceptor, a previously identified inhibitor of axon regeneration. Epistasis \nanalyses indicate that LIN-12 might be a target of autophagy in axon \nregeneration. Together, our data suggest that DLK-mediated injury signaling can \nactivate autophagy, which might limit the level of LIN-12 and NOTCH proteins to \npromote axon regeneration. Our findings reveal that autophagy activation can \npromote axon regeneration in neurons that lack maximal regrowth capacity, \nproviding a promising therapeutic strategy for axon injury.",

Reactive aldehydes such as \n4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) are critical mediators of mitochondrial dysfunction but \nthe sources of mitochondrial 4-HNE in cardiac diseases together with its \nmechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether the \nmitochondrial enzyme monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), which generates H2O2 as a \nby-product of catecholamine metabolism, is a source of deleterious 4-HNE in HF. \nWe found that MAO-A activation increased mitochondrial ROS and promoted local \n4-HNE production inside the mitochondria through cardiolipin peroxidation in \nprimary cardiomyocytes. Deleterious effects of MAO-A/4-HNE on cardiac \ndysfunction were prevented by activation of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase \n2 (ALDH2), the main enzyme for 4-HNE metabolism. Mechanistically, MAO-A-derived \n4-HNE bound to newly identified targets VDAC and MCU to promote ER-mitochondria \ncontact sites and MCU higher-order complex formation. The resulting \nmitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation participated in mitochondrial respiratory \ndysfunction and loss of membrane potential, as shown with the protective effects \nof the MCU inhibitor, RU360. Most interestingly, these findings were \nrecapitulated in a chronic model of ischemic remodeling where pharmacological or \ngenetic inhibition of MAO-A protected the mice from 4-HNE accumulation, MCU \noligomer formation and Ca2+ overload, thus mitigating ventricular dysfunction. \nTo our knowledge, these are the first evidences linking MAO-A activation to \nmitoCa2+ mishandling through local 4-HNE production, contributing to energetic \nfailure and postischemic remodeling.",

Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD+ sensor, we show \nthat NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization.

            "TEXT": "Ischemia-induced ACSL4 activation contributes to ferroptosis-mediated tissue \ninjury in intestinal ischemia/reperfusion.\n\nFerroptosis is a recently identified form of regulated cell death defined by the \niron-dependent accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species. Ferroptosis has \nbeen studied in various diseases such as cancer, Parkinson's disease, and \nstroke. However, the exact function and mechanism of ferroptosis in \nischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, especially in the intestine, remains unknown. \nConsidering the unique conditions required for ferroptosis, we hypothesize that \nischemia promotes ferroptosis immediately after intestinal reperfusion. In \ncontrast to conventional strategies employed in I/R studies, we focused on the \nischemic phase. Here we verified ferroptosis by assessing proferroptotic changes \nafter ischemia along with protein and lipid peroxidation levels during \nreperfusion. The inhibition of ferroptosis by liproxstatin-1 ameliorated \nI/R-induced intestinal injury. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 \n(ACSL4), which is a key enzyme that regulates lipid composition, has been shown \nto contribute to the execution of ferroptosis, but its role in I/R needs \nclarification. In the present study, we used rosiglitazone (ROSI) and siRNA to \ninhibit ischemia/hypoxia-induced ACSL4 in vivo and in vitro. The results \ndemonstrated that ACSL4 inhibition before reperfusion protected against \nferroptosis and cell death. Further investigation revealed that special protein \n1 (Sp1) was a crucial transcription factor that increased ACSL4 transcription by \nbinding to the ACSL4 promoter region. Collectively, this study demonstrates that \nferroptosis is closely associated with intestinal I/R injury, and that ACSL4 has \na critical role in this lethal process. Sp1 is an important factor in promoting \nACSL4 expression. These results suggest a unique and effective mechanistic \napproach for intestinal I/R injury prevention and treatment.",

            "TEXT": "DMDRMR-Mediated Regulation of m(6)A-Modified CDK4 by m(6)A Reader IGF2BP3 Drives \nccRCC Progression.\n\nAberrant N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has emerged as a driver of tumor \ninitiation and progression, yet how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are involved in \nthe regulation of m6A remains unknown. Here we utilize data from 12 cancer types \nfrom The Cancer Genome Atlas to comprehensively map lncRNAs that are potentially \nderegulated by DNA methylation. A novel DNA methylation-deregulated and RNA m6A \nreader-cooperating lncRNA (DMDRMR) facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in \nclear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Mechanistically, DMDRMR bound \ninsulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) to stabilize \ntarget genes, including the cell-cycle kinase CDK4 and three extracellular \nmatrix components (COL6A1, LAMA5, and FN1), by specifically enhancing IGF2BP3 \nactivity on them in an m6A-dependent manner. Consequently, DMDRMR and IGF2BP3 \nenhanced the G1-S transition, thus promoting cell proliferation in ccRCC. In \npatients with ccRCC, high coexpression of DMDRMR and IGF2BP3 was associated with \npoor outcomes. Our findings reveal that DMDRMR cooperates with IGF2BP3 to \nregulate target genes in an m6A-dependent manner and may represent a potential \ndiagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic target in ccRCC. SIGNIFICANCE: This \nstudy demonstrates that the lncRNA DMDRMR acts as a cofactor for IGF2BP3 to \nstabilize target genes in an m6A-dependent manner, thus exerting essential \noncogenic roles in ccRCC.",

We conducted a genomic analysis of 348 estrogen receptor-positive \n(ER+) breast cancers treated with CDK4/6i and identified loss-of-function \nmutations affecting FAT1 and RB1 linked to drug resistance. FAT1 loss led to \nmarked elevations in CDK6, the suppression of which restored sensitivity to \nCDK4/6i. The induction of CDK6 was mediated by the Hippo pathway with \naccumulation of YAP and TAZ transcription factors on the CDK6 promoter. Genomic \nalterations in other Hippo pathway components were also found to promote CDK4/6i \nresistance. These findings uncover a tumor suppressor function of Hippo \nsignaling in ER+ breast cancer and establish FAT1 loss as a mechanism of \nresistance to CDK4/6i.",

The PARP inhibitor olaparib is a \nmolecularly targeted drug that continues to be investigated in BRCA-mutated \ntumors. However, in tumors without BRCA gene mutations, particularly in STAD, \nthe effect and molecular mechanism of olaparib are unclear, which largely \nrestricts the use of olaparib in STAD treatment. In this study, the in vitro \nresults showed that olaparib specifically inhibited cell growth and migration, \nexerting antitumor effect in STAD cell lines. In addition, a ClC-3/SGK1 \nregulatory axis was identified and validated in STAD cells. We then found that \nthe down-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis attenuated olaparib-induced cell growth \nand migration inhibition. On the contrary, the up-regulation of ClC-3/SGK1 axis \nenhanced olaparib-induced cell growth and migration inhibition, and the \nenhancement effect could be attenuated by SGK1 knockdown. Consistently, the \nwhole-cell recorded chloride current activated by olaparib presented the same \nvariation trend. Next, the clinical data showed that ClC-3 and SGK1 were highly \nexpressed in human STAD tissues and positively correlated (r = 0.276, \nP = 0.009). Furthermore, high protein expression of both ClC-3 (P = 0.030) and \nSGK1 (P = 0.006) was associated with poor survival rate in STAD patients, and \npositive correlations between ClC-3/SGK1 and their downstream molecules in STAD \ntissues were demonstrated via the GEPIA datasets. Finally, our results suggested \nthat olaparib inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway in STAD cells, and up-regulation of \nClC-3/SGK1 axis enhanced olaparib-induced PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition. The \nanimal experiments indicated that olaparib also exerted antitumor effect in \nvivo. Altogether, our findings illustrate that olaparib exerts antitumor effect \nin human STAD, and ClC-3/SGK1 regulatory axis enhances the olaparib-induced \nantitumor effect. Up-regulation of the ClC-3/SGK1 axis may provide promising \ntherapeutic potential for the clinical application of olaparib in STAD \ntreatment.",

Autophagy is a protective process involving self-cannibalization \nto maintain cellular energy homeostasis during nutrient deprivation. We \ndeveloped a mouse model for Lkb1-deficient lung cancer with conditional deletion \nof essential autophagy gene Atg7 to test whether autophagy compensates for LKB1 \nloss for tumor cells to survive energy crises. We found that autophagy ablation \nwas synthetically lethal during Lkb1-deficient lung tumorigenesis in both tumor \ninitiation and tumor growth. We further found that autophagy deficiency causes \ndefective intracellular recycling, which limits amino acids to support \nmitochondrial energy production in starved cancer cells and causes \nautophagy-deficient cells to be more dependent on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) for \nenergy production, leading to reduced lipid reserve and energy crisis. Our \nfindings strongly suggest that autophagy inhibition could be a strategy for \ntreating LKB1-deficient lung tumors.",

            "TEXT": "Hypoxia-induced acetylation of PAK1 enhances autophagy and promotes brain \ntumorigenesis via phosphorylating ATG5.\n\nAlthough the treatment of brain tumors by targeting kinase-regulated \nmacroautophagy/autophagy, is under investigation, the precise mechanism \nunderlying autophagy initiation and its significance in glioblastoma (GBM) \nremains to be defined. Here, we report that PAK1 (p21 [RAC1] activated kinase 1) \nis significantly upregulated and promotes GBM development. The Cancer Genome \nAtlas analysis suggests that the oncogenic role of PAK1 in GBM is mainly \nassociated with autophagy. Subsequent experiments demonstrate that PAK1 indeed \nserves as a positive modulator for hypoxia-induced autophagy in GBM. \nMechanistically, hypoxia induces ELP3-mediated PAK1 acetylation at K420, which \nsuppresses the dimerization of PAK1 and enhances its activity, thereby leading \nto subsequent PAK1-mediated ATG5 (autophagy related 5) phosphorylation at the \nT101 residue. This event not only protects ATG5 from ubiquitination-dependent \ndegradation but also increases the affinity between the ATG12-ATG5 complex and \nATG16L1 (autophagy related 16 like 1). Consequently, ELP3-dependent PAK1 (K420) \nacetylation and PAK1-mediated ATG5 (T101) phosphorylation are required for \nhypoxia-induced autophagy and brain tumorigenesis by promoting autophagosome \nformation. Silencing PAK1 with shRNA or small molecule inhibitor FRAX597 \npotentially blocks autophagy and GBM growth. Furthermore, SIRT1-mediated \nPAK1-deacetylation at K420 hinders autophagy and GBM growth. Clinically, the \nlevels of PAK1 (K420) acetylation significantly correlate with the expression of \nATG5 (T101) phosphorylation in GBM patients. Together, this report uncovers that \nthe acetylation modification and kinase activity of PAK1 plays an instrumental \nrole in hypoxia-induced autophagy initiation and maintaining GBM growth. \nTherefore, PAK1 and its regulator in the autophagy pathway might represent \npotential therapeutic targets for GBM treatment.",

BRCA1 is critical for homologous recombination of DNA \ndouble-strand breaks (DSB). Through its coiled-coil domain, BRCA1 interacts with \nan essential partner, PALB2, recruiting BRCA2 and RAD51 to sites of DNA damage. \nMissense mutations within the coiled-coil domain of BRCA1 (e.g., L1407P) that \naffect the interaction with PALB2 have been reported in familial breast cancer. \nWe hypothesized that if PALB2 regulates or mediates BRCA1 tumor suppressor \nfunction, ablation of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction may also elicit genomic \ninstability and tumor susceptibility. We generated mice defective for the \nBrca1-Palb2 interaction (Brca1 L1363P in mice) and established MEF cells from \nthese mice. Brca1 L1363P/L1363P MEF exhibited hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging \nagents and failed to recruit Rad51 to DSB. Brca1 L1363P/L1363P mice were viable \nbut exhibited various FA symptoms including growth retardation, \nhyperpigmentation, skeletal abnormalities, and male/female infertility. \nFurthermore, all Brca1 L1363P/L1363P mice exhibited macrocytosis and died due to \nbone marrow failure or lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia with activating Notch1 \nmutations. These phenotypes closely recapitulate clinical features observed in \npatients with FA. Collectively, this model effectively demonstrates the \nsignificance of the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction in genome integrity and provides an \nFA model to investigate hematopoietic stem cells for mechanisms underlying \nprogressive failure of hematopoiesis and associated development of \nleukemia/lymphoma, and other FA phenotypes.",

            "TEXT": "Rosuvastatin protects against coronary microembolization-induced cardiac injury \nvia inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation.\n\nCoronary microembolization (CME), a common reason for periprocedural myocardial \ninfarction (PMI), bears very important prognostic implications. However, the \nmolecular mechanisms related to CME remain largely elusive. Statins have been \nshown to prevent PMI, but the underlying mechanism has not been identified. \nHere, we examine whether the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to CME-induced \ncardiac injury and investigate the effects of statin therapy on CME. In vivo \nstudy, mice with CME were treated with 40 mg/kg/d rosuvastatin (RVS) orally or a \nselective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 intraperitoneally (20 mg/kg/d). \nMice treated with MCC950 and RVS showed improved cardiac contractile function \nand morphological changes, diminished fibrosis and microinfarct size, and \nreduced serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Mechanistically, RVS decreased \nthe expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, interleukin-1β, and Gasdermin D N-terminal \ndomains. Proteomics analysis revealed that RVS restored the energy metabolism \nand oxidative phosphorylation in CME. Furthermore, reduced reactive oxygen \nspecies (ROS) level and alleviated mitochondrial damage were observed in \nRVS-treated mice. In vitro study, RVS inhibited the activation of NLRP3 \ninflammasome induced by tumor necrosis factor α plus hypoxia in H9c2 cells. \nMeanwhile, the pyroptosis was also suppressed by RVS, indicated by the increased \ncell viability, decreased LDH and propidium iodide uptake in H9c2 cells. RVS \nalso reduced the level of mitochondrial ROS generation in vitro. Our results \nindicate the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent cardiac pyroptosis plays an important \nrole in CME-induced cardiac injury and its inhibitor exerts cardioprotective \neffect following CME. We also uncover the anti-pyroptosis role of RVS in CME, \nwhich is associated with regulating mitochondrial ROS.",

Paradoxically, senescent cells develop an inflammatory \nsecretome, termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which is \nimplicated in age-related pathologies including cancer. Here, we report that \nsenescent cells actively synthesize and release small extracellular vesicles \n(sEV) with a distinctive size distribution. Mechanistically, SIRT1 loss \nsupported accelerated sEV production despite enhanced proteome-wide \nubiquitination, a process correlated with ATP6V1A downregulation and defective \nlysosomal acidification. Once released, senescent stromal sEVs significantly \naltered the expression profile of recipient cancer cells and enhanced their \naggressiveness, specifically drug resistance mediated by expression of \nATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 4 (ABCB4). Targeting SIRT1 with agonist \nSRT2104 prevented development of cancer resistance by restraining sEV production \nby senescent stromal cells. In clinical oncology, sEVs in peripheral blood of \nposttreatment cancer patients were readily detectable by routine biotechniques, \npresenting an exploitable biomarker to monitor therapeutic efficacy and predict \nlong-term outcome. Together, this study identifies a distinct mechanism \nsupporting pathologic activities of senescent cells and provides a potent avenue \nto circumvent advanced human malignancies by cotargeting cancer cells and their \nsurrounding microenvironment, which contributes to drug resistance via secretion \nof sEVs from senescent stromal cells. SIGNIFICANCE: Senescent stromal cells \nproduce a large number of sEVs to promote cancer resistance in therapeutic \nsettings, a process driven by SIRT1 decline in stromal cells and ABCB4 \naugmentation in cancer cells.",

Therefore, it is important to increase our understanding \nof the biology of these cells and utilize this information to enhance their \nsurvival and function in the injured heart.

We also found that mitophagy was \nmediated by mitophagy receptors, rather than the PINK1-PRKN/PARKIN pathway. \nMitophagy mediated by BNIP3L/NIX and FUNDC1 was not involved in regulating \nprogenitor cell fate determination, mitochondrial biogenesis, or reprogramming. \nInstead, mitophagy facilitated the CPCs to undergo proper mitochondrial network \nreorganization during differentiation. Abrogating BNIP3L- and FUNDC1-mediated \nmitophagy during differentiation led to sustained mitochondrial fission and \nformation of donut-shaped impaired mitochondria. It also resulted in increased \nsusceptibility to cell death and failure to survive the infarcted heart. \nFinally, aging is associated with accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) \ndamage in cells and we found that acquiring mtDNA mutations selectively \ndisrupted the differentiation-activated mitophagy program in CPCs.
